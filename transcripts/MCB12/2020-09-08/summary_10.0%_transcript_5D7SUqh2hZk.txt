I, just I just want to be clear that everybody is aware that there are the three of us on right now at plus ebenezer and like 22 people from the public.
Are you good with taking minutes you ready to roll yep a little roll okey Dokey, welcome everybody to the September community board parks and community board 12 Manhattan parks and Cultural Affairs Committee Meeting?
We've got Jennifer Hoppa from the Parks Department and we've got looks like about 30 attendees in the audience, including a couple of people with their hands raised.
I understand it's important to the cloisters, which has now reopened, as have many museums for limited timed entry, and there are, but I understand that the City council's traffic and transportation committee is going to be having a public hearing on not just margaret corbin drive but on road usage in general, both streets that were closed for play, streets and recreation, and to increase social distancing as people, use, parks and open spaces, and also the use of roadways as it relates to restaurants and bars so that they can have increased outdoor seating.
They know what the problem is dragging them to a meeting to have that back and forth did not seem like a terribly useful, a good use of people's time, but I do think that I'm just wondering Jennifer is there anything that parks concessions are doing.
When we see if people are trying to disembark or tie up their jet ski, that is an issue for our marinas absolutely and then our marine operations division works with NYPD harbor unit and others.
Thank you and when we have, I did encourage ross to make sure that the university is copious with their signage, explaining you know when it's going to be closed when they anticipate it being open just so that people know what's going on, but if anybody sees that there's work happening sees that it's closed.
They have to be wearing masks, so this is for all concessions, city- wide in parks that they will be able to have small gatherings with you, know: weddings bar mitzvahs anniversary, parties, whatever it is that people do when they have small events of 50 people or fewer.
And then I'm going to go quickly to the beginning of the round table of updates from nonprofits, because I know there are a couple of people who need to leave by seven.
I understand that the that the met is obviously strongly in favor of continuing to keep of having the road be open, because that's how people access the museum, So people who are coming to the cloisters from outside of the neighborhood are actually going to be getting off at the 181St street.
Stop and we've been working with the MTA to ensure that the bus service runs in to the park so that people can arrive at the cloisters and that's also critical for anyone arriving with accessibility issues.
You know we'd love, to be able to spread the words about restaurants in the neighborhood that people should go to a lot of people when they're leaving the cloisters will actually be going down towards Dietman as well as back towards you know: The 181St street stop right, particularly.
There's, a coastal cleanup at 145Th, which I know is a little south for you guys, but I figured I'd, shoot it out there just in case and potentially also West, Harlem, piers, potentially also at 172Nd. There is a project at 151St, Street same thing.
I'm, going to move to Aaron sims from Inwood, artworks, hello,, I, guess almost fall, So Inward artworks for those who do not know its mission is to create and curate professional, performing and visual arts in Inwood and surrounding community, and that definitely applies to Washington Heights and also in the northwest.
Outdoor film night is probably safer than the unmasked undistanced partying that's happening in the park, so You know there may be some hopefully give us an update, an update on that during your report.
One of our members has actually inspected the dock and also recognized that it was in great shape, but we have pivoted that we're going to be offering this Saturday an online, a training program or exercise program, specifically targeted for rowers, our participants, people that we've worked with in the community in the past years in Inwood that will be advertised and, depending on the response, we're hoping to go forward to doing a more weekly, typo online or else in parks.
There have been a couple of outside socially distanced masked events that we've done, and this September we're focusing them all on making sure that people do the census and coupling it with letting people get getting letting people know about the community fridge that is now out the corner of 165Th and Amsterdam avenue.
My question was just simply: If people that are utilizing the fridge are maybe getting information on other resources in the community, for whatever other needs, they may have and, as you know, I'm, unable to put in the chat.
I've got a question in the chat based on the time asking about where the cleanup is on Saturday So, Obed I'm, going to unmute you briefly, so that you can give us some information on when on where people should be meeting up.
I know there was one at indian road Right at the entrance to Inwood Hill park, we're still in If a group comes to parks.
We've, been sort of spreading that temporary public art project throughout the city right near where friends of Inwood Hill park help us at Inwood.
We're going to have Jennifer's parks report, which will include some of the questions that people have been throwing up in the chat And then we're going to have a discussion of our capital and expense budget.
I think some of the lingering questions from some of the things that I've spoken about in my update kind of fit into Jennifer's parks report.
We've got some questions in the chat about the about the road which, again, I will be passing all of that information on to the traffic and Transportation committee, but I think that's, It is a road in the park.
Do not have to like read out that information, excellent A lot of people more people are using the 10 miles of trails in Inward, Hill Park.
Let people know that the Parks Department has launched a new campaign.
The natural areas, conservancy friends of Inwood Hill Park, the Fort Trying Park Trust up We'd love everybody's help to toss your trash, where you can use reusable materials.
We have the play streets, so the city's working hard to try to accommodate as many people as we can outside special event permits right.
I did want to say: We've got some additional stewardship days coming up three at Inwood, Hill park.
It help if parks enforcement personnel were working at night when littering occurs and handing out tickets so speak a little bit about what the staffing is for pap, what their scheduling is and how best to you know, leverage that limited resource sure.
Forward, complaints and issues to me, And I, send that to the Manhattan captain, But. As many people know here.
There are a couple of questions in the chat about just sort of general partying large groups of people, There's trash What's, the ongoing way of dealing with this, because, right so park enforcement and social distance ambassadors that usually, you know, would be assigned to recreation divisions.
Event, there's amplified sound And, it's clearly a safety issue, then Parks or police have to come and sort of disperse I know that there are some questions from the from the committee, but we've got a couple of people who have been in the in the public who have been patiently waiting with their hands.
You know there are divisions that follow social media to track things and helpful people in the community also give us heads, up.
You know there was a another large- scale, event, so And, it's unfortunately, not just Inwood Hill park I mean my only comment is that this does not seem to be happening in central park and Riverside park.
It's not like every park has no problems, It's literally happening in every other park, including Oh prospect, park, Brooklyn, Queens, I'm, not excusing it, and this is my community too, but I guess what I'm saying is You know it's, whereas maybe it's been isolated before it's much more broad spread If you everything at once has definitely been a challenge, if you Jennifer and Steve, if he's still on the call, could reach out agency to agency to the NYPD, I feel like that would go a long way in the NYPD, realizing that it's not just you know, six people from the community that do not have anything better to do with their time than complain that this is a real problem and that you as an agency need their help as well as an agency for them to do their law enforcement.
I know I personally contact the precinct specifically directly because I do not have time to waste on 3, 1, 1 and most people are not even aware half of the people wonder where there's even a parks enforcement unit.
I was actually just going to mention that that we talked about this at the Public Safety Committee meeting the other day, and I asked the officers if they always respond to every 3, 1- 1 complaint, and they said yes, so I just wanted to mention.
They can issue a parking ticket, but if they're, if it seems like there's a criminal element to what's happening, then that is for the you know: Trained, NYPD or agency.
Instead of you know regular park trash we're having to take all that to the dump on top of everything else, so it definitely makes things more challenging than they need to be.
Is that the pep and the NYPD be there at indian, Road and 207Th street along their Saturday morning, Sunday morning, starting at nine o'clock and confiscate the stuff you're not allowed to have alcohol in the park when they start to bring it in on the hand, truck it'd, be confiscated, you're not allowed to have loud speakers in the park you confiscate that has been traditionally done in the past That will be a tremendous service to our neighbors in Inwood, so that they can actually use the park in these last weeks of summer, because, what's really happened is that the residents of Inwood have been both by and large, vanished from the park and these revelers, and these this you know, anti- Social sub- group, have taken over our parks to the detriment of our own community.
Some people are asking about the Precinct Community council meetings and most they have not happened.
This is an issue that I care about and that all of the people who have been commenting in the chat and that we all care about this is the parks and Cultural Affairs Committee, and while a lot of those issues are happening in parks, that's a public safety.
Hill Park has equipment that we can loan grabbers and gloves if people want to do cleanups.
And, so I guess I want to push back against what was said a few moments ago about you know like heavily enforcing certain things and targeting people who are gathering in the parks, especially if it's daytime I can understand, because the concerns around noise at the in the evenings when people are trying to sleep like Tanya, raised before.
So I like to spend some time at the September meeting talking about some of the items so that we can, you know, think about it, have some preliminary conversation and then circle back to it.
And, it's like 750 or 800,000 project, Okay, now can we ask about the state of certain structures now Before I get to you, though Daryl I'm going to recognize Steve, because I'm, pretty sure he's got something relevant to say about capital Ayesha, so from housing and youth in Ed. I was in the habit of seeing the register being used to be able to see what the city responded.
You know different people are just going to come down on that differently, but there's no reason not to include it as an item.
I should be communicating with curtis about you know this ongoing obvious issue related to enforcement, which is an expense item, not a capital item, but That.
But, I, think that should be a larger expense item through the health and Environment Committee to address recycling throughout the district, including in our parks.
We're going to need money at some point soon to do the other two fields: That's, actually my bad for not having included that as an item that had come up previously, because there was broad support for the for the one ball field and then for expanding it to the three ball fields, and many people asked what about the other two.
This is something that was supposed to be funded in year, two of participatory budgeting, but tree pit guards along Broadway and other areas, because I think parks invest a lot of money in trees that continue to die, most of which, I think are reported within the contracted time frame, but some of which are not, And I.
All item, just increasing parks's funding for various different kinds of staff from playground associates to recreational Associates urban park rangers for a variety of the programming that they offer funding additional staff for sanitation, maintenance and operations and horticulture, and maintaining funding to continue to provide six days of services for libraries, which I do not know if that's going to come out of our committee or come out of education.
So I would like to see some sort of item that talks about dedicating dollars to the Parks Department for expanding their outdoor learning initiative in parks and community gardens.
I just want to make sure that what the items are is complete so that when I send them out to people for their considerations, for when we are ranking them next month that we have a complete list, so I will be communicating to faye about outdoor learning and what was that somebody had some wording there.
I would play the outdoor learning initiative in parks, community gardens and other green spaces Steve with the invasive removal, because that's you know!
I'm, not sure if we want to have this be a separate point or just like kind of include formally incarcerated people as another group to target for programming.
There continues to be sort of the lingering question and concern about the enforcement issue in parks, balancing legitimate use and the very compelling argument that Danielle made that aisha, echoed We've talked about a lot in this committee before as well.
As, you know, people's legitimate need to have some peace and quiet, and what is the Parks Department's role in that?
She did not realize that you know like many people.
So, if all you see is the hot mess that is your local park in Inwood or Washington Heights, and you do not know that this is a condition happening.
