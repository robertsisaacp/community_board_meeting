You could also okay, if you could also send your information to Steve that he can distribute to the committee I, don't know how to navigate Webex.
So I, don't even know where to find the information you post easy, so follow, send tested, Tuesdays I'll be taking place, start on December and then following pretty much starting at the part of Harlem working north to Washington, but and tell me again what is that day of action.
My I, don't know exactly where it's being sponsored by the Inwood merchant association, but the I think it's right at the entrance to that open, dining, street.
Send that to the committee members all right, thank you, Nye I, hope, Community Board 12's health committee was at least as good as yours.
One of them is to observe World Aids Day every December by having it getting an update on the situation with respect to HIV Aids in our community and we're usually fortunate enough to have Dr Gordon Peter Gordon, the medical director of the comprehensive HIV infectious disease clinic at New, York Presbyterian hospital come before us.
Extemporaneously and kind of tell you that when I came before the committee last year, I think most of us were confident that the end of the epidemic initiative, which the governor launched back in 2015, was on close to being on target and I.
Think most of us who are in this field think that we're unfortunately going to see some of those gains plateau off the sexual health clinics of New York City, which were so key for both diagnosing people who did not know their zero status and providing prevention for people at risk for HIV were close for many months.
I will say that Nyp's sexual health service stayed open during every week of the epidemic, and we've continued to enroll record numbers of people in HIV prevention, make new diagnoses and engage folks in care.
Really almost the hardest group is the 20 to 30,000 New Yorkers, who have fallen out of care with their HIV and likely are not receiving antiretroviral therapy and because of that, their viral loads are not suppressed and they're, capable of then transmitting the virus to others, and, As you can all imagine on this committee, the coronavirus epidemic has created really unprecedented challenges for individuals to access care to access basic services.
We deal with the coronavirus to also deal with the other epidemics of HIV and Hepatitis, C and I, Think all the discussions you know.
As you said, When I began to speak, there is a new appreciation, I think for the impact of infectious disease on even you, know.
Our efforts on ending the HIV epidemic, as we simultaneously have to you: know, hopefully introduce vaccines and wind down the coronavirus epidemic in New, York, City and while we're at it, we should pull hepatitis c in there because, like coronavirus, we could, If we were assiduous and dedicated to this task, hepatitis, c, HIV and coronavirus in a rear, view, mirror.
Thank, you very much, and but before we open it up for questions, I just want to refer to the latest annual surveillance statistics issued by the city on HIV Aids in Washington heights in Inwood.
Is we've built a very sensitive dashboard that looks to identify individuals touching the emergency rooms at Nyp and the other sites, and you know, picked up another 1700 people who seem to be living with the virus but have uncertain care engagement.
Hi I just basically had a question about colbit and HIV, and how that you know how people fare with that.
That then becomes unchecked, and it may be that some degree of you know suppression that people living with HIV that they're less likely to develop some of the serious lung complications.
You know some activity against coronavirus, but the standard antiretrovirals and the doses that we use don't look like they have any of it.
The question is in terms of the vaccine: Do you think that people in this group with Aids HIV, will have first access to it.
If folks, don't know, July 3rd of 2021 will be the 40th anniversary of the New York Times article that came out about.
Well and I appreciate the fact that you do take time out every year to talk to us and to bring us up to date, and let us know about the vitally important work that you're doing.
But, as you all know, the numbers of positivity is trending in the wrong direction, and the mayor announced today that he thinks we are entering into a second wave, which is not what we want.
You know there was a restaurant that I think was in the news about saying how they were providing rapid testing so that their patrons can dine in at their restaurant and it cost.
So we just want to make sure that people understand that rapid testing is essentially meant for folks who need to return to work.
We just really want to make sure people understand that rapid testing is not meant, as a.
We have information on our website about the holiday travel guidance and about you know gatherings, but we really just are looking forward to having the community help in sharing this message, because I think people are very tired of hearing from government.
You know, sheltered away from their families, and so we just really need everyone's cooperation and help in pushing out this messaging and really also, You know putting up information about mental health services as well, because we know in general how the holiday season can bring out a lot of emotions and feelings in people even prior to Covid-19, and so we really want people to continue to maintain their mental health as well.
I know Steve loves looking at the data page, so we will continue obviously to keep that as up-to-date as possible and there is a new vaccine, page.
The whole point about people using rapid testing as a means to you, know, go out and gather with their family and friends, and you know skirt the social distancing regulations.
Think it's really disheartening to see people using rapid testing as a way to do.
I think what we really need to make sure that people understand is that this rapid testing is meant for folks who are required by their employer to go get tested and that they don't need to be in quarantine.
But it's really to help assist people who really need you know either to go back to work or to understand like what their status is, so that they can keep their family members safe while they are maintaining and practicing all the social distancing.
I know that they have done a lot of work in that regard, and then there have been some where we've heard about restaurants in Manhattan, where they were having too many people at a certain time or they were gathering outside, Inappropriately.
That's, supported through our employees, have dedicated most of this year's efforts really to combat the issue of food and security and staff, and you know I've gathered more than 90,000, which has been given to a number of organizations, including cloth and catholic charities, to do some of that some of their work.
Okay, That nature is the one who, at the last meeting, said that she had heard that the you know that the clinics had been closed, which I told her at that time.
I, also like to say that before Pauline gets off, is that I really want to thank her and the oh or really partner with the hospital and supporting our various flu shot events that we had in the community.
A lot of folks have pinned their hopes on a vaccine, but you know, as you may have read today, from I guess.
You know, we at the hospital relied a great deal with care providers from out of state who came volunteer, who came to New York to help out.
You, know health care workers to come to the aid of New Yorkers or for assistance, so New York producer has planned and has been reported.
Do, you think it's going to be possible for you to provide to do similar community events, as you do with the flu shots.
I think it'll be up to the state and to the city to stand up locations where we will be able to provide the vaccines to the community and so right now we have a vaccine task force that is working out.
That would look like how that would all operate, and then also there is this question about equity and also about vaccine hesitancy among certain communities, and so we will definitely be reaching out to the community board local community-based organizations on how we can message properly.
People are very tired of hearing from government, and we understand that, and so we're going to be looking for community partners.
The thrust of my question for Julio about doing the community events was making it easier for people in the community to get vaccinated and to try to overcome whatever hesitancy they may have to make it as simple as possible.
You know, I think, would need to play a very important role, as bling said that there has been a history of folks really not getting vaccinated for the flu, So we'll probably have the same situation where people will not get vaccinated or will be reluctant to get vaccinated for corvid for a lot of reasons.
It is I, just wanted to say that the community outreach you know, ideas about you know for the vaccines is something that we talked about in our aging committee.
So I think that we should that the health community has to look at overcoming the obstacles that have happened with the shingles vaccine.
The word will get out, but it's definitely something that I think you know the state and the city are thinking about in terms of how we are going to be distributing the vaccine and then also making sure that people are getting that follow-up.
You know people who had access to it like medical workers were making sure their families got it and others.
And I mean actual wealthy people were, You know able to get it.
So, of course, You know the first cohort would be the frontline medical staff and then it'll be people who are most vulnerable so underlying conditions, and things like that, and.
So I believe that there is a lot of discussion about what this would look like in terms of making sure that it's equitable across the city and who you know, falls into the category of being vulnerable and working it out that way.
It's something that we are working very hard to try and figure out what the right you know.
So I think that once we you know, go through this phase, people are getting.
Any other committee, members, okay, but Bernard Grobman, wants to ask a question.
But I do know that, in terms of like hardest hit communities, They are prioritizing getting the vaccine into those locations, and so that'll encompass.
As Julio, generously, mentioned, We, you know, have been working really hard on the medical Center neighborhood fund, and we want to thank him for that, because this is really a collaborative effort.
You know very vulnerable population, so that's all I have to say for now any questions I just want to be clear, I think what I heard you say is that a decision was made not to host any community events for the entire calendar.
