So, let's proceed, then all right. So tonight it should be a very interesting night. I hope our meeting so tonight our committee will be discussing an important matter related to the new york new york public school new york city, public school, this that has 1.1 million students with 1 500 school buildings in our city, out of which almost 20 000 students are in from graves the k to twelve in washington, height and inwood. So just that the city of the public school is facing we are facing as well. So I think it's very important that tonight we play like all night. So on all meetings, we pay attention to the discussion that we hello. There is some interruption, okay, all right! So as we are aware, as we as we all are aware, almost two weeks ago, to be precise september, first, the major along with other top ranking leaders, the mayor and along with the chancellor, richard carranza, the ufc president michael mulgrew, also council of the schools, supervisors and administrators president mark tennis, arrow and, of course, the dc 37 executive director. Henry garrido, they announced their agreement that they finally reached an agreement to reopen new york public school, effective monday september, the 21st that is precisely a week from today. So students will begin in-person learning, however, their announce their announcement is not a center from challenges and speaking of challenges. Tonight our committee had invited several guests and, in my personal opinion, probably the most important stay home because they are the parents. So I'd like to introduce the parents that will be discussing with us their concern. We have gabriella remigio. We also have lee medina, elisa reid. We have also naduska. These are parents who have children in the district and also other borrowed like the bronze. So we want to make a combination to actually learn and learn about their experience and their opinions. What exactly all this that is going on means to them? How do they feel? What is their opinions, so they will be sharing with us their experiences and, of course they will provide us with their opinions about the challenges. You know all these wave problems. You know the system is facing, so I trust that you have already read our agenda, but on the first item in our agenda you will see the reopening of new york city, public schools and the growing uncertainty and the item number number three we're going to discuss the ventilation problems, also in public, which is one of the major problems, and you know that the system it's facing after the parents speak and they provide their inputs. We're gonna ask questions to the parents and then, following the q, a section we are going to have all a new business at that point. If any organization or anyone has any announcement for the community, that would be the time to to share your announcement to say that, after the parents provider inputs, there is a set of questions that we have. The committee have prepared to ask the the parents, so let's call the first at least to make sure that they still with us is graviela remijo with us. Are you here, yes raise your hands? If you are with us? Yes, I'm here today, everybody you hear me. Yes, thank you for joining us now. Are you here specifically medina? Are you with us lee looking at the broader area, because the 181st street can't really be looked at least since I don't think that lives with us? Yet what about elisa reid? Elisa? Are you with us a lot of action on that script? So they are looking read. Are you with us? They are being mindful of. I guess they have not joined the meeting. Yet, let's I cannot hear you if you cannot view yourself, I would appreciate it very much. Let's see nadius are you with us? Thank you. Welcome how about benny torivio is benny. Toriview with us, ot will be presenting to this committee on that matter in november. Second, awesome, all right malia can chew on yourself. I don't know how to do that. All right! Yes, I can hear you now. Yes, so you did it already for your present all right. So I guess again, I'm going to ask for lee medina. It's limiting that with us. Now all right, neither elisa reid, okay, all right now I hear some noise on the background. Whatever you find, whatever you want or find yourself, if there is any noise in there, I would appreciate if you can knew yourself, so the noise doesn't rebound to you know to our meeting. So, let's proceed I would like to. I would like to share a brief description of some of the things that is going on before our parents share with us all the good. You know, opinions and experience that they are collectively you know going through. So I wanted to share that at the same time last week it was tuesday to be precise, as you probably already heard, teachers were supposed to report to school building to get prepared in advance for the for the 21st. So, for example, they have to go for training, professional development and read and readiness to collaborate and prepare for the blended and remote learning that you know supposed to start on the 21st, hopefully so as we're speaking what teachers are doing in just getting ready to start off each other to receive. You know a student to start teaching and in september 21st. So this wednesday after you know this wednesday september, the 16th it is suspected that teacher will be, will begin to engage in studying and preparation and orientations to help them familiarize to the newest school year, which is very important, as you know, there's many students that they still they don't know even their parents. They don't know how to not pay the assistant. So this is the time or some of the other things that they are doing to to prepare students in advance. So when the 21st comes on student, at least, they will have an idea how to navigate the system, so another things also is that that I would like to share is that the city has also made a priority: the access to copy 19 testing all available to students, teachers and does schools based staff attending four psi across the city. So, but I understood also that, although all these resources are available to them, I'm not sure whether or not this is mandated so, but I heard that is not so. Let's see how this is to play out and also priority, so priority will be given to these 34 sites to all the oe workers, so they can quickly be tested and provide results within 24 to 48 hours. Well seems to be very, you know promising, so meaning that any staff that go to one of the sites, so the DOE will know the result within that frame of time, basically in a day or two days, the most all right. So another piece of information that I would like also to affect October the first- and this is, according of course, to sources with the DOE and chop peak as well so and thereafter, based on a monthly base, I'm going to acquire what I read what I came across. It says that it would be mandatory for the school to test a random from 10 to 20 samples of their students participating in blender learning and onsite a staff population. Families will be asked to sign a consent form at the start of the year for their child to participate around them and be notified ahead of time. Can you please ally and jonathan a mute yourself, because we all can hear your conversations, so we can proceed with the with the meeting appreciate it. Thank you. So I just want to give you this heads up. There is more to come, but in the meantime I would like to ask each patterns before we go into the actual questions that we have, so they can personally identify themselves yeah any experience briefly. They, for example, mercedes my parents. My name is such and sons, my my child. It's registered in washington, high or I live in washington heights and share whatever experience they want to volunteer. You don't have to necessarily share what a school, in particular your song or your daughter, is going to. You can keep that to yourself. It's sufficient that you say that you are the parents that reside in washington heights and that your son or daughter is accepted into one of this local school. So, let's proceed and let's call right now, gabriella remigio dabiela. Am I pronouncing your name correctly perfect? Thank you got it all right. The floor is your gabriella and thank you again for for joining us now. Thank you for inviting me for me. It's very important. I have a child who's going to the seventh grade, she's going to the blended option she wants to go to school, I'm confident that she'll be fine. Her school has been very proactive. Having communication every week we have meetings discussing all the steps. Obviously they give us the days and the information and it's always subject to change and because, depending on what happens and so far, she's ready and already her account has been set up and her council, they have been emailing every issue that we find they are always available. I'm satisfied with the steps so far. I know that it's not easy and we all had to deal with it at the beginning and try to as much as possible help our children and I'm one of those parents I'm going to have her tested on friday. I'm actually doing coffee testing, I'm working in the washington heights clinic for the rapid testing and I'm going to bring her on friday to have a test before monday when she goes she's supposed to go to school. If everything stays the same, okay, very well, I'm sure are we going to hear a lot more from you? Yes, thank you gabriella. What about medina lee? Are you with us? Excuse me: how about elisa? Are you with us? Let's call them the next party naduska ramirez adjuska, hey hello! Yes, so thank you for allowing us to be here. Thank you, okay, so, in regards to the to the school and the way that they're proceeding, you know, I think that the schools are doing the best they can under the circumstances. As a parent. I am eager that my kids go back to school. I think that at that age it is essential that they continue to have social contacts with other kids. I think it's imperative, because they're just you know they could just fall into just focusing on electronics and that's not good for humankind, but one of the things I'm concerned about is the mixed messages when it comes to the news outlets and compared to what the schools are trying to do. Sometimes that doesn't give me security, because when I hear like the representatives of teachers, I think it's the uft and he's not comfortable in opening up. That gives us a little bit of security, yeah and security. I know they're trying their best, but I'm not sure if they're getting the proper support and if politics is playing a part in this, that's very concerning, because it's our kids future. That's on the line, that's all I have for now. All right, I'm sure you will have a lot more, but thank you definitely, you know so much. Yes, it's a good start all right. What about benny? Are you still there? I know he just texts me saying that he having some problem trying to join us all right lee. Are you there hi, hello or elisa? Are you there? I guess that they are having problem trying to log in this is the first time that we are using a different platform, so it's not soon which a lot of people are really accustomed to it, but anyway, let's start the some of the question and I'm going back to gabriella again it if it's okay with you gabriella. So I would like to ask you well and bear in mind that you know all this is basically more about. How did you feel about the uncertainty that we all are experienced experiencing right now, going back to school, feeling that the department is not really guiding us? The way, probably, we expected many feel that they are not prepared, also the problems with the with the ventilation, which is going to be a separate discussion. Of course, but right now most of the questions that I may have as well my cali for you guys it's basically basic based on your you know on your experience. So let me ask you- and I'm going to say this- the question in english and spanish to make sure that it's any folks in there any parents or anyone who may feel more comfortable in spanish. At least they get to know exactly. What is the question that I am asking you so? The first question that I have is what were some of the concerns you had as a parent when you heard the school, where reopening so and I'm going to say that in spanish. Obviously, the fact that the building was prepared to have a proper ventilation, that was one social distances, distancing like to make sure that the children are now all packed up in one room and interacting each other, that they wear their masks or any other protective gear that they need. I know that some of the issues that the federation of teacher has are bringing up is the fact that the department of education- doesn't they don't have yet the gear to offer the chill the teachers and all the cleaning supplies that doesn't work, but also, I I'm expecting that the parents do their part. Also, my daughter, I trust her- that she's conscious enough that she's grown up enough to always wear her mask and follow all the procedures and other things that they have assured us is the common areas that they that is going to be under control and a lot of things. The fact that she has to take a bus. It worries me, but I see parents also with children, nowhere in a mask and the buses. I think- and now I see it like people are complying a little bit more. Yes, that all those things are very: it's not just the building, there's a lot of things that are out of the whole going back to school process and she wants to go out. So I have to trust her that she's gonna follow the rules and all the guidance and stay safe and keep all the people and her classmates and the teachers safe, also very good. Yes, I know that it's very hard to put in one sentence or even two sentences. You know the concern that many parents you know have regarding all this reopening and not only parents, I guess the whole, the entire environment. You know people there is people inside their houses that wondering whether or not they should go to the grocery store or call up. You know to make the to get delivery. So it's a very ascending, the children. You know to school that they don't know exactly what would be the outcome and with all these negative news that we are listening constantly. So, let's see exactly what naduska may have to say about. You know this question and remember you don't have to answer all the questions. Necessarily, if you don't feel like it, if you, if you feel that you have something to say about it, so I don't want you to feel that you know- or let me just say it in reverse- feel free to answer. If you feel up to it so nadio scott, you would like to jump in yeah. I could jump in I'm screaming yeah. So I I'm in agreement with gabriela. It is it's a very you know, even though we want the kids to go back to school, because it's important, but there are some precautions that, like we have to take into consideration and, like you know, she also highlighted about the school not being prepared. Another concern that I would like to add, and I think she just she tapped on it a bit. It was that it's not only for the students well-being, but also for the teachers, well-being. I think it was. There was some statistics that a lot of the teachers there, you know they're past a certain age point is, I believe, 45 or 50., and they have a higher chances of having some underlying issue, and you know they're really risking themselves in going back to school and although most of the kids could be asymptomatic like they say, but they run a risk and not having the teachers there mentally working to teach. I think that it could also take a toll on the students, because, if they're very concerned they're very worried about getting sick, I can't see themselves like teaching freely and that's what you know. We really need. We need teacher, we need teachers that they feel competent and in a safe requirement so that they could do their work. So I think those two things going hand in hand not only that we also have high populations where people have pre-existing conditions: asthma, diabetes, respiratory disorders, okay, who's speaking who's speaking who's. Telling kid please. Yes, my name is lisandra medina alessandra, yes lee I was asking this is one of the parents. Yes, thank you for joining us. Yes, how are you? Okay hold on please guys. We have a mix of conversation going around, so let's pose for one second, so let me introduce then the the two new parents that they just had joey knows, and I don't know, did you guys heard the question that I just asked a few minutes ago? Okay, so I'm going to repeat the question, so you can piggyback with us again. So I also think I don't know if benny are you with us? Well, okay! So, anyway, the question the question asked was what, where some of the concerns you had as a parent as a parent when you heard the school where reopening okay and I'm going to say that in spanish as well again, abs, so by all mean please, before you answer the question lee and and lisa, please tell us disidentify yourself and tell us in which this three you have your your children or your children going to school. You don't have to necessarily volunteer the name of the school where we are going. Okay, we currently reside in district five. My daughter goes to school in district four, and your name is your name for the record. Lisandra melina wonderful! Yes, go ahead! Please! Okay, my children have pre-existing conditions. My son, who was a former student of health careers and health sciences and careers. He has multiple conditions where one of them he needs a major surgery where he's going to have traction, skeletal traction and halos for at least five months. Wow being that he's having this procedure and being that, my daughter has a congenital heart defect. She has asthma secondary to chronic lung disease because she acquired a hospital infection. Okay. It is not a good idea for me to send them to school. If my daughter, god forbid, contracted Covid-19, it can spread to her heart. It can spread to her heart. That would mean for her a six to eight week. Hospital stay on iv, antibiotics and that's not going to guarantee a good condition, good quality of life afterwards and being that my son is going to have something that's being introduced from the outside into his bones, and that's going to be like that for five months. If I send her to school and she manages to contract this Covid-19, it's gonna take us all out, wow. So being that and what I was saying before, with all remote children, there are a lot of children with pre-existing conditions when announced as a pandemic. Okay- and it's not just you know, this is not just the students, it's also teachers and staff, as per healthy people, 2010 2020 and 2030 diabetes, asthma, other respiratory illnesses, obesity, those are considered pre-existing conditions. Those are really rampant amongst our community. Therefore they are more susceptible to either contracting Covid-19 or not being able to make a full recovery wow. These were the questions I asked myself. Do I have money for a cremation? Do I have money for three? Do I have money for funerals? Do I have money for burials? Do I have forty thousand dollars for each of their hospital stays? The answer to that was all no, and that was what you know influenced my decision to make sure that my daughter was 100 virtual, at least fighting for that. You know on a regular before clovid before Covid-19. It was very difficult to determine if a student came to school, sick, all right, usually the time frame for a nurse or a staff. Member to call a parent saying: hey come pick up your kid they're sick, it's usually between 11, 30 and 1 o'clock. Unless this kid throws up on the principal or teacher's shoes at 8am, then maybe you'll get a call by 10.. That means, if somebody was asymptomatic and contagious, managed to pass a temperature check if they had covered, there's a big chance that everybody in that classroom is going to have covert yes, and if people have pre-existing conditions and most of us do. Okay, most of us have some sort of condition where either we take medicine or we have to be monitored. That puts them at a greater risk. It's not just people who are over 50, it's people with those pre-existing conditions. There are a lot of kids that have to have those forms filled out if they have asthma or if they need medication. They are at risk, yes, wow and now that they had started reopening the schools already staff members infected, they have to shut down. We haven't even hit the second wave yeah, but it's rough and the way you just describe it. You know it's been very clear and it's a powerful statement. Well, I can say yes, this is the reality that you know parents are facing today, yes and now and additionally, there are no legal protections. If a teacher staff, member or student comes down with Covid-19 right now, the house was trying to push a bill, which means this is going to affect all 50 states that if you are, if you contract Covid-19 in school, whether you're a staff member or student, they are protected from legal litigation for five years, which means if we are coerced to send our children to school and there's no other alternative and they get covered. We can't go back and sue for medical expenses or funeral money, and then there are a lot of people who are either uninsured or underinsured. Medicaid has a backlog of at least six months, a lot of private insurance companies. They don't want to cover covert related expenses. Wow see, I have a difference and you see I have a very different. I have a very different experience because I've had people die around me from covert. I have family members that have died, but my kids were in school. My kids stayed in school, elisa, hey, hi, elisa my kids, so my name is alyssa reed and I live in the Bronx, but my kids go to district 12. They go to ps128 and my kids were in school this whole time because they were going to the enrichment center. So my kids never left school and they put protection measures in place. My kids have were going to school the whole summer. They were going to school after March when school is officially closed there. My son has iep so he has extra help. He has a learning, disability and his psych. He has adhd and his psychology his doctor was the one that told me put him in an enrichment center, because it's not only about their health, it's also about their mental health, and some kids need to be around other children for their mental health. They need to be engaged in life and yes, Covid-19 is ugly. Yes, Covid-19 is killing yes, but if we have the right measures in place, we can get through it. What I did was when they said school was reopening officially. The first thing that I thought about was you know what safety measures are going to be in place in the enrichment centers, all the children's their temperatures were taken. They took multiple breaks throughout the day outside masks, worn gloves, worn through them, throw out the gloves throughout the mask when they come inside brand new gloves. So there are certain things that can be taken into account for kids, that don't have. The kind of you know, there's certain kids that are going to not be able to go because of like what she said. Her kids can absolutely not go. They can't take that risk. They have too many to too many health issues to be put at risk, so her kids absolutely cannot be in a classroom with all this going on. They shouldn't even have been in the classroom normally during flu season, because I can only imagine during the months of flow season, kids get sick. All the time and kids are the hardest because they touch everything. It's hard to tell a kid: don't touch, don't do this, don't do that they don't understand so to a certain extent, certain kids cannot return to school because their health issues are too much. Their health issues are too great and but see my kids. They don't have any health issues. My kids, thank god healthy, except for like adhd, and things like that and my kids. I, like I said I had them in the enrichment centers where they were safe, they haven't contracted anything. Yet you know- and I say yet, because the second wave will be coming. So we don't know what's gonna happen, but I will be sending my kids to school the two days that they have been assigned. I have four kids: all of them are going to be returning to school for the two days that they're being given with precautions. I trust more, my school than I do. The department of education as a whole and I feel like it's gonna- have to come down to the schools. I feel like the schools are going to have to take the safety measures. The department of education will not be taking or will not be enforcing, and that's why I travel an hour to the school, because I have more faith in the school and in the school's ability to keep the children safe and put in monitor and putting things in place. You know put in safety measures that even the department of education is not enforcing or they're, not worried about so far. The only thing that we've gotten from the department of education is about the ventilation system. All right, that's fine, but I want to know more not only about the ventilation systems. That's important. I understand, but I want to know about the daycare at the enrichment center, the custodial staff which is contracted from the outside. It's not contracted by the department of education they used to stay and they used to wipe down and disinfect every inch of the school. Every day. Every single day the teachers worked in two shifts. The first teachers were working in the morning till the afternoon at one and then the second wave of teachers were work from one to five, and that was the hours of the enrichment center. This whole this whole summer, and it gave them time everything was wiped down bleach. You know they cleaned everything down. That's something that I need to know. Are you going to be wiping everything down, because at the end of the day, when the kids go home, that's just seething bacteria. On all these surfaces, I mean I don't care, how much social distancing you do. They come back the next day, they're touching everything needs to be wiped down. I want to know what kind of custodial you know what is going to happen with that. Second, what does happen if a kid gets sick? They send us a letter stating all we put them in isolation and they got to come picked up and then, but then a test takes weeks to get the results. You take this kid in for a test he's negative or he's positive. He can't go back to school until you get those results back, because what? If you? So it's like there's a lot of things that they don't that the department of education doesn't talk about, doesn't address most of the information I've gotten has been from the news or from the school itself, and even the school itself, there's only so much information that they themselves have because the department of education is so they're, just not engaged with the parents as they should be, and the teachers, the all they told us about the teachers were that the teachers are going to be tested on a monthly basis. All right, that's fine! What about everyone else that works at the school, the matrons the lunch. Ladies, the custodial staff, the speech therapists that come in to give kids extra services the social workers. You know all these people are part of staff and they're, not teachers are they also going to be tested because they are also part of the school system, the security guards that work there. Sometimes they switch security guards in the middle of the week. We don't know these people. What about then? Yes, all right well said lisa. Thank you so much that was lisa, elisa reid, aaron's, washington heights parents. So let me see who else has not? It's benny told evil benny today. Do you want to answer that question? We should when we come back, maybe when we come back to the to the to the ventilation? Sorry, but if you want to piggyback with us, it's okay, I hear some noise and I don't know who exactly it's had the noise. In the background, please contribute yourself if you are having conversation wherever you find yourself. Thank you. So now, let's see what today, you benny thought of you wanna. You wanna answer the question the first question about what was what were some of the concerns you had as a parent. When you heard the school wear reopening, I'm not benny. Are you there can't you unnear yourself, big chance for you all right? Well, let's move well right now I understand my colleague has has a question one day. One day cruz is the assistant chair of the youth and education committee, and I believe that he has. I think he has to question. No. He has a question for now. I guess yes, he's gonna be asking two questions, so why did you want to proceed with the with the next question for the parents? Yes, I do so. I wanted to know how effective was remote learning in your home last year last school year. Maybe you want to set it in spanish as well, so is anybody listening to? It was definitely a challenge, but we did make it through. This is lee is speaking now. Yes, I'm sorry! Yes, my name is again my daughter. We live in district five. She goes to district school in district four. She does have an iep. Yes, it was challenging. It is challenging, especially if kids have a special needs. Intellectual needs, or you know, if they're easily distracted it was. It was definitely a challenge, but she did make it through. There were a lot of obstacles in the sense that I think and believe they were using entirely way too many interfaces to get assignments done, so one class might require three apps and another class might require five apps and you think you're done with your work and then lord and behold, surprise. You have work in an additional app connectivity. Communication was definitely a challenge, but again we made it through. I guess in order for virtual learning to be conducive, it has to have some level of being seamless. There has to be direct communication and people have to be proactive. Absolutely yes, I for me, remote living was a complete disaster. It doesn't work who says who's speaking yesterday at least now. Okay, so please go ahead. Listen. I have four kids one in high school, one who now graduated to middle school, and then I have two that are still in elementary school and I'll. Tell you this right. Now the remote learning was a complete disaster on every level. The curriculum was a joke. If this is what they're actually teaching the kids, it's horrible, because it's completely misinformation also they did not do any classes. Once a week with the teacher, all the kids are talking at the same time, she's, basically just saying hello to everyone so happy to see you and that's it. That's not learning they left everything to the parents, the parents. We don't know, I'm not a teacher. I cannot teach my kids. I am too worried about working making sure I have enough money to provide for all this time. I don't have time to teach four different grades and three of my four kids have ieps. I don't have time I can't and then on top of that they did provide tablets, but halfway through the tablets are not working. There's a problem with the connecting they're not connecting to the internet, there's no place where I can physically take the tablets. I have to call make a ticket, it took them a month and a half to get back to me. So it's like not everybody can not. Everyone has a device, not every and some of the things that they want us to. Do you can't even do on the phone? It requires either a computer or an ipad? So and, like I said it's you, they gave assignments where read this answer. This read this answer this and then a bunch of youtube videos. If you're going to do a remote learning, and now it's going to be difficult because you're going to have half in learn in-house learning, half remote, you have to have everyone on the same thing you have to act like this is an actual school at 9am. I want everyone logged in. I want everyone there. Everyone should be here for this. They didn't do any of that and I doubt that they have it figured out even now. So it's like right now. They said school starts on september, 21st, they're, talking about orientations online and all these meetings online for what these meetings are useless, you're, not giving us any information and you're just repeating the same thing: nothing new and the kids. The kids are the last year everyone passed because of the situation this year. It's like you want remote learning, but you don't send package home. You don't send me anything. You post assignments on three different platforms. You got, google meets, you got the google classroom, then you got them on the on the on the what you call it. They call it the other app where they do the work on the I ready, which doesn't work on a phone. It has to be a computer or an ipad, and it's like it's too much. I have other things to worry about. To be honest, if you want me to stay home and be home school and homeschool, my kids, okay, that means I can't work. That means I can't do anything else, but do that because I can't I can't go to work for eight nine ten hours so then come back and help my kids with homework, and then you want them, oh by 3 o'clock and then another thing with the remote learning is when they did have meetings. They would send an alert that morning and they'd be like oh, it's nine o'clock at 10 o'clock, I'll post, a link for 11.. No, you need to tell me the day before or two days before, so that I can know, because you don't know if I'm gonna be working, you don't know. If I'm gonna be able to be there, you don't know who's gonna, be you can't sit there and make these meetings every day on the day hours before and expect the kids to show up it's a lot to deal with and we're not getting any support from the department of education or from the schools and the schools are doing the best as they can, with what they're being given. If they're, not given the correct tools or the correct technology or platforms to do their jobs, we cannot accuse the teachers or the school of not doing their part when the department of education is not providing them with what they need. A lot of these teachers are old elderly teachers, ps128 alone, which is my school. Some of those teachers are still there from. When I was a student, they cannot sit here and get sick and it's hard for them. Also because people forget teachers also have families, they have kids and now they're gonna have to teach as well yeah because they can't go to school either. Yes, so it's like they have their own kids grandchildren. Some of them have, you know, disabilities, their grandparents. You know they have their grandkids and you're, expecting teachers to be what superheroes like they're supposed to teach our kids their kids and also provide for their own families. It's too much and you're, not even gonna, downgrade the sizes, you're saying: oh we're, gonna downgrade the sizes of the classes and have them go two days a week. Okay, that's fine! But how much can they really get done in those two days? Because I'm telling I'm saying it right now, my kids! This is going to be very difficult. For my kids at least the days that they don't go is going to be very difficult because my kids are special. They have ieps, they need the sets, they need the extra help that they get in school and that's on top of their regular classes. So now you want me to take on being a special education teacher, a speech therapist, a math tutor and I gotta work and I gotta cook and I gotta clean and I gotta do all these things. It's too much. This is too much yes, that is too much yes, and it is well you see so far. We can really witness the frustration that many of our parents are growing too. It's not really that easy, as many probably not even you know can imagine so I just wonder so far. Let me see gabriella you want to speak to that. Do you want to answer the question or speak to that? You know so whatever? Well, you remember the question, or should we repeat it yeah, it's disregarding the yes, the learning when we were thrown off into it at the beginning. Yes, it was challenging. I agree, I agree, and I know there were a lot of parents were frustrated because I was from home. I work from with schools and I was calling parents also and they would express their food with this. The whole thing the way they were working. I know perhaps sometimes when my daughter was trying to do things, they wouldn't work, but I also I were always. There was no everything about her lessons and every school was differently. I mean she had her teacher. Would record or live stream live her lessons and then she will take a picture and then upload it. She had to do it just the same way that she would do it in school all the time she will use the apps, and things like that. So I mean this was engine, but we got through it and yeah cool, so while they were teaching their children, some of them for parents, I understand misread because her situation is really and one-on-one assistance. I know that when I remember the last day I was working because I go from school to school. I was in cobb city, it was the 14th of March and during that week all the custodians were go. They were wiping the handles. They were cleaning every two hours. Hopefully that's happened again, the cleaning, but it's I can't understand frustration of our parents like that. We usually during the summer with the special education, children and we couldn't do in this year because they were home to take you know, breathing and just so because it's difficult I'm not in her situation. I just yeah a little bit older and she doesn't have all that. You know kids. They are difficult early age, but I don't know it's just yeah. She was right, I mean all the personnel is supposed to. As I tell you, I was working at the washington heights clinic with the department of health, doing coffee testing and during the week of the 4th september, the first week we didn't see anybody else, but people from the. Unfortunately, I don't know why it was so low the registration of employees and teachers that were coming that we started taking people from the community because we were not gonna, be there if people walking wanting to be tested, so it is difficult. So, yes, it is to try to stay on top and make sure that we are taking care of ourselves, and so we can take care of the others. And I agree that if the department wants to do the test, they can do the testing child will take it to the clinic and do it also because we need to we work on getting the best. We can okay. Well. Thank you. Thank you. So I would like to proceed with the next question that I have and also conceal the flora to also some of my colleagues so because I know some of my colleagues also may have questions, but I would like to ask a question: it's a simple question in some way, but I think it's very meaningful, at least for me personally, so you know so far. We you have shared with us your experiences. You know why what exactly it has been? You know you or are you pay your concerns, but I also think that you have friends or you have neighbors, or you probably heard and you're surrounding other parents perhaps complain, and this is what my next question has to do with. So I would like to ask, for example, what were other parents concerned about the reopening of your school and in spanish? What I mean to say is among your friends your circle of friends, neighbors. Colleagues. Did you want to share any other concern that perhaps they had confining you or share with you or discuss it with you? Maybe lee you want to jump into this lee? Yes, absolutely. I was waiting for turn yeah. Okay, my name is lisandra medina. You call me lee. I do have three kids, but the primary concern is my daughter's school because she goes to school in a high riser, so for background high risers, since the crash of 1929 a lot of windows either require a key or they're not functional, so there is no real, proper ventilation or what have you and then they're all shoved into this elevator to go up so anyhow, my other daughter goes to a hospital based school and because of her needs, you know she had to go back and my concern over there. Since it's out of district was, she normally doesn't get sick, but when she does get sick, it's like on a plague level like she's brought home mrsa she's brought home vre she's brought home c diff. She had to be quarantined for some strain of the flu that wasn't covered on the vaccine schedule. You know things like that. So when she does get sick, it is major, but anyhow you know she's going there, but she's staying somewhere else, so we're safe. On that end, with my other daughter, I guess the major concerns. Okay, the governor's plan was if the infection rate was less than five percent. Schools would start gradually reopening once it hit over. I think he said seven percent or ten percent, either seven or ten percent. Over a period of seven to fourteen days, then the schools will be shut down immediately, which is why I kind of didn't want them to rush to open back up with flu season being out. We haven't hit the second wave and there's actually two strains of cobra, there's the cobra 19 and then there's cov2. So let's say things go well and then we can transition them. You know opening back, but now we're dealing with all these other elements, and we have to you know it's there's the peace of mind like okay. Do you have the flu or do you have the rona? You know? Do we have to quarantine, or are we good now? If things don't go according to plan, and then they wind up having to immediately shut down the schools? I think that it would be equally frustrating, because now you have to find a new plan. You know before you were going to work and you know the kids were going to school and now they're, not so for people that don't have support systems or a grandmother or an auntie or a neighbor. That can, you know, stay with these kids now they're scrambling for plan b, plan c and plan d. You know in the event that these schools are shut down again and remember. We have very high populations of people with pre-existing conditions, so anything can pop up I'd. Rather, you know until it's safe to reopen when it's really safe. This isn't a trip to costco where you're there for two or three hours and you're walking around this is kids being at a desk with or without barriers sitting in a classroom for extended periods of time and remember before coving, the teacher sometimes doesn't notice that the kid is sick until lunchtime. So by that time everybody has it and remember. If you're asymptomatic, you're passing a temperature check, symptomatic means you have a fever. So by that time everybody's been exposed, and then you have to contact everybody and say by the way you might have. I'm gonna get this real, quick because not get it alexandria. Give me one. Second, please someone is speaking on the background. Excuse me, I hear some noise in the background. Please knew yourself if you are speaking to someone else. Please smear yourself. What's up see? Yes, alexander, you want to finish your scheming, please yeah! Nobody in my immediate household has contracted kovic, but we do have family members that have either been exposed or you know, had it and got over it, and then we also have friends that weren't so lucky that either they succumbed to Covid-19 or complications of or they still haven't, gotten over covered and it had secondary and tertiary damages. Like kidney failure, heart failure, you know any type, you know systemic failures where they needed, you know acute dialysis or they needed. You know heavy medical interventions that they otherwise would not have been going through and by the way they weren't in the at-risk category. Okay, they went to be treated for something else and they wound up contracting Covid-19 in the hospital. I think the worst case that I know of personally she went for you know. I think she thought she had the flu she tested negative for Covid-19 a couple of days later she couldn't breathe. She went back, they had to put her in an induced coma for six weeks, and you know that situation was not. You know it didn't it. You know it did like. I said either. You know you get over it or you die and if you don't there's a big there's, also the chance that you're going to have extended health problems because of it all right, like I said that aspect, you know I'd rather be safe than sorry, because I know I can't afford if they get sick from when I say sick, that's kind of sick or if they die, it's a very unfortunate situation. Yes, all right! Thank you alexander, my least. I call it lee all right, so I would like to give the opportunity to nadia or nadusta if she wanted to say something and speak to that questions, you know, have you heard any comments among your friends or colleagues complaining or how do they feel about? You know the situation about the reopening of the school. This is precisely about what you have heard about your you know what your friends are saying: your neighbor, your calories. What do they think about this reopening? So in my case, the things I've heard is how we're gonna pull through how we're gonna pull through, because we know- and you know, understanding that there are. There are exceptions that there are cases that are exceptional and that they need special care or that they need a special arrangement. They would have needed special arrangements without the Covid-19 situation, but the concern is like how could they make it a successful year for their child because, like sometimes we forget- and it adds part to the frustration? But if we kind of be you know, we keep it in mind. I think this is kind of something that could help is that this situation with the colvate isn't something that was expected. It was not something that was planned or that at least the this generation at least the last three or four generations have experience. So what happened in March about the school? Shutting down you know the like. I, the teachers were not the teachers were not prepared, but no were the parents, so everybody was who was working on emergency mode. They were like trying to figure out what to do, based on the limited information that they had and with the limited information that everybody knew. So sometimes we have to kind of remember that and that's what we kind of share, at least when I speak with my friends and we talk about okay. How are we gonna go through this, so how we're gonna push through, and we kind of try to conclude is that you know we have to be alert. We have to we're going to have to do sacrifices that you know, I'm not a woman. My kids are not homeschooled and I was never planning to be a homeschool teacher. But because of this is an extraordinary situation you I have to give away some things that I'm not accustomed to. So, for example, and while we were going through the phase in the last academic year, you know we were trying on our own to put schedules so that we could help the kids pay attention and stay focused. But it's a hard thing to do. It's gonna be a hard challenge now also, but you know we just have to make sacrifices understanding that this is the benefit for our child. So you know some of us have to work during that time, but it's just trying to figure out ways so that we could pull through and not get like get dropped in into all the negativity, if that makes sense because it's gonna come, but we just have to so basically the same way that you had expressed how you feel so you're telling probably that that's how your friends exactly or the people that you have come across the parents feel the same way. Yeah. That's definitely my response. Their input is how do we, how we're gonna make it through? What's gonna like? Are we like how we're gonna push through, because, again it's a it's a situation that was not expected, it can be planned. I could blame the you know. I love to blame other people, not sharing the information or not being more actively prepared, but everybody was hit. It was blindsided, so we have to make the best that we could do what is going on. So we have yes, that's what happened. That's the concern like how we're gonna make sure that my kids, that graduated really learned everything that they needed to learn to graduate or to go to the next level, because these things will impact them in the future, see my friends and family. My family, oh yeah, hold on please one thing that I wanted you to bear in mind. Please do not jump into the conversation. Just raise your hand, so we avoid you, know. Confusion and you're allowed to raise your hand, so I can acknowledge and people know exactly who exactly wanted to speak. I suspect that this is lisa right, yeah elisa I was looking this isn't zoom, so I can't raise my hand. I was looking for a little button. Okay, my family. They don't want my kids in their houses because they're going to school, so they feel that, like my nephew would not be going to school. My sister and my mother decided that he's not going to school he's going to be remote learning and because I'm sending my kids to school, she doesn't want for my kids to go to her house and for my nephew to maybe get sick. I have friends that are worried because they don't speak english and they can't help their kids with the homework. I have neighbors that come to me for me to help them with their kids because they didn't understand what they were asking of them and the kids didn't know that much english either. So that's gonna, be that's a very big problem that some of my friends and family are having. I have friends that, unfortunately, are undocumented and they're scared that if they ask for help for their kids, then you know something's gonna happen and I have to tell them. You know: that's not how it works. You know, and you can ask for help. Nothing is gonna happen and there's just so much again misinformation. A lot of my friends like I said, they're scared to even go to the school, to ask for anything, because they're scared that they're going to ask them for papers and they're going to scare they're going to ask for id. Some of them didn't want to ask for tablets, because one of the things when you ask for the templates is that when fedex shows up, you have to show your id to get the tablet, and some of them didn't have ids, so they didn't know how they were going to get these tablets. So, apart from just going back to school, a lot of these parents are scared that, with the remote learning they can't help their kids. They don't know english. The kids are barely knowing english they're scared that if they ask for help something's going to happen. Apart from that, some are scared that if their kids do return to school, they'll get sick and then that's a whole new kind of worms. There's just so much, and especially my friends with little kids they're scared, because they're so small, especially the ones that are going back to daycare or pre-k that they're, not old enough to understand, don't touch put on your gloves, always wear your mask. They're scared about what could happen with them. I have a friend who has a special needs child in a wheelchair, the school, the elevator at the school she's scared about them using the elevators at the school. Now because they're gonna be shoving all these kids in an elevator and if he gets sick, it's gonna be a problem. Also. Another thing that they're worried about is a lot of my friends and other families that I, that I you know help and work with through coach dave. Some of them are scared that some of them are scared that their kids are not going to get the special needs that they are normally getting all the special programs. All the the special services that the school provides, because they've already said that a lot of speech therapists are not going to be going to the schools. They want to do remote. A lot of physical therapy, you know a lot of these services for special needs. Children. We don't know where they stand because they haven't given us any information about it either. So there's good that a lot of the children are not going to get these services, because already the department of education is saying they will not be able to go to the schools to provide these one-on-one sessions, and these kids need this one-on-one sessions badly. Oh may I say something: okay, briefly, because we have to move go ahead. Please who's this! Yes yeah, I'm gonna be very brief. Yes, the board event. Actually you know I'm employing the board of events to provide more support and more services for parents. You know whether it and it's not just the board of it's also the state of new york parents that have to work. They need child care. That is, you know. You know that was critical even before Covid-19, they need child care so that you know if remote learning is a reality where you know they can't send their kids to school, then they need that child care. Also for the kids with special needs. Remember they have pre-existing conditions as well. It's a lot of times. It's just not. You know one specific issue, a lot of these kids. If they have one primary issue, it's almost guaranteed that they have secondary and tertiary issues for the kids who shouldn't or can't go to school. You know, perhaps maybe they should send. You know the therapist to the home. If the parents are open to it, where you know like early intervention when they used to have home-based services or when the kid required home-based services, they would send a therapist, they had a caseload. Usually you know because of kobe, you know, let's keep it, you know less than 10 kids, they visit 10 homes on a rotational basis and these kids can get their services and I guess the other issue is you know the kids who are you know, residing in homeless, shelters in foster care school was a refuge for them. You know, but there are other problems that need to be addressed so that this can go seamlessly. There is a chance we're going to have to shut them down again. I agree: well the 21st, I'm really waiting. Very, I would say, I'm very eager to see what's gonna happen, how it's going to look like, but let me tell you this conversation is going to have a part two, because I really want to know and hear from you and other parents as well. What exactly is like a what's going to happen after the 21st? I wanted to see if you all the promises that the city you know giveaway is making right now. Is they really going if they're really going to deliver those promise so now, since time? Actually we have probably like a half an hour more to go. I wanted to allow my one of my cali that she says she has a question. Delaney aquino. I think she has she's gonna be asking the next question. This is gonna, be our fourth question by the way so glenn, yes, can you want to ask your question please? If you can translate your question as well would be much appreciated, hi everyone! Thank you for joining us. So our fourth question is: how safe do you feel schools are considering the many schools with ventilation problems and in spanish is so. Thank you glenny. Thank you. So I hope everybody understood the question. So let me let me see if benny who had not participated yet danny, are you there somewhere benny? Are you listening to us hello, benny, rejection, all right, so benny is not so gabriella. You wanna you. Let's start with you. Do you wanna answer that question gabriella and then we're going to ask naduska and then the question is the question is here: let me say to you in english and spanish: how safe do you feel schools are considering the many schools with ventilation problems? It's okay! Let me repeat it. Let me repeat it for her. What she's asking is how safe do you feel schools are considering wait? Let me let me let me take one step back. How safe do you feel schools are considering the many schools with ventilation problems, in other words, cantan, seguro, uste, o segura, usted uste siente, especially because I'm not an expert in terms of ventilation. I know my the building where my daughters go to school. It is in good condition now that doesn't mean that it has the proper ventilation. I know that the species the classrooms and they have promised that there will be at any time more than nine students per her classroom and yeah. I mean honest honestly, I don't know exactly I kind of answered that question because they have talked to us and they told us how they remove the excess of furniture, even those classrooms that have computers. They have taken the computers out to make more room and make a I mean as distance as possible between every student and also the windows they open and close. They have no issues with the windows, but definitely I wouldn't tell like they have like the negative or positive or flow airflow like the way. I have it in the room that I'm when I'm testing somebody for comment, so I mean I know that they don't have it because, usually and there's a lot of buildings that are really old and yes, they have even issues with heating and ac, and I mean we know it's a challenge again. We go back to there, but yeah. Definitely, there's no assurance that the ventilation is going to be the right one. Yes, we just hope for the best and hope that they keep on working on it, because this is working work in progress. It's not it's not done and thank you gabriella. I know this could be a tricky question, but remember every questions that we ask in every response that you can you decide to volunteer. So this is just matter of opinion. You know so just feel free to say if you necessarily don't have an opinion just to say. Unfortunately, you know I have an opinion or just feel free to say whatever is you know it's in your mind? So it's not a right or wrong. You know respond on this so and with that in mind, so I won't you wanna, you wanna say anything about that sandra. Are you there? Yes, I'm here! I'm sorry. Did you hear the question? Yes, if I feel safe with regards to the ventilation system? Okay, my answer with regards to ventilation, PPE contingency and sanitation, and I'm speaking as a former healthcare professional, I'm speaking as a former power professional of the board of education, I'm speaking as a parent of special needs children and an advocate of over 18 years, and I'm also speaking as their mom. I don't feel safe, you don't deserve and you think that and you and I guess at the same time you feel that other school as well or paris, another school may feel the same way. Yes all right. So it's just simple! Thank you! So what about an abused? Canadian? You want to say anything! Okay, so you said it's an open opinion right. So my concern is that if you have, if we having we're considering ventilation problems now with the schools, this is something that should have been addressed before coleman. So it's a much bigger thing, so this like there's some things about the teachers and the principals and the schools that they like they protest or they want to speak on, and sometimes it gets ignored because whatever budget reasons whatever this is unfortunate, we shouldn't be in this situation where we're trying to attack our kids to a school. That's not it's not properly prepared. So this is this is concerning, and on this point I like, I was danced together with the with the deal. We always remember, because there is no reason why we should be sending children to a school that is not in proper condition. That should be like that. For me, I think that's more important than some of the services that are being provided, understanding that all those services are needed, but to say to send a child to a location that is not properly prepared is incorrect. For many reasons, it's a bad standard that we thought that we put to our children so that it's totally and it has- I don't know how or if they want to stop because of this until they get the problem, then let it be, but under no circumstances should children or that be forced to work in a situation where they're not feeling safe. It's just not food. Thank you all right. Well now, let's move to the to the next question. I think this is going to be question. Number five. I guess so far right, oh my god. We have so many questions all right. I know one of my colleagues also. I have another question while they, I think you say you have another question. So are you wanted to go with the question sure? Thank you all right. So do you guys feel that district 12 I mean, I know, there's people that are not in this district on this call. But do you feel like your district then has communicated with you guys effectively about all the measures being taken all the safety measures being taken place? Maybe you want? Can you translate that as well? Oh, I can translate for you, don't worry about it. Basically, what he's saying is that so, let's go back to benny. Are you there? Benny, don't say I see it seems like guillermo has his hand raised. I don't know if he wanted to say something. Please sorry about that, but the members are going to have the opportunity to speak also after the parents. So go ahead. This question is for the parents- okay, good, I speak effort. Don't worry, keep going, okay! Yes, let allow me allow me then allow the parents to express themselves first and then the community comes, and you know appreciate it. Thank you so nadioska did you want to answer that question. Please yeah. My opinion on that is that I think they're trying, because I think the DOE is trying, but then it gets convoluted with the misinformation or the contradicting information from the politicians. That's including de Blasio, and you know, and to the certain extent, that rich, the karamza guy what's frustrating as a parent is the miscommunication. Today we heard the mayor saying something at eight o'clock in the morning or whatever in the morning, and then you have the ufc saying something else in the afternoon and that's frustrating and that doesn't give any comfort to a pack. So they need to again it's just. They need to get together. Captain mine said know what they're gonna say: agree stop being like stuck with the politics and then share the information to the parents, so that we could feel comfortable to press forward, but because they do are not on the line. It's just good and conformity. That's my opinion on that yeah, but remember the question it's about precisely, and I appreciate you highlight that your piece of information, but we wanted to know or what aldi had just asked, is if you feel that this industry, meaning the I'll, say the office of the superintendent, who is the the office that represent the entitled a school district, if you feel that they had community, if you feel that his office has communicated with parents effectively about what was taking place with the school ventilation system, this is in your case, because you live in washington heights, but for lee for alexandra medina it would be her district how her district communicated you know effectively. So this is what this question is about, so in our pca, you extend it to the mayor as well. Yes, so I think I still stand with what what I said before is that, yes, you could get information from the district yeah I'm in washington heights, but it causes frustration when it's contradicted by the mayor's office by the usp. It's very it's very disconforting, so you could communicate. You could tell me you could tell me one thing, but immediately after I'm getting contradictory information, it doesn't give any comfort. So that's why I said these leaders. They know their leaders, they have to get on the same page whatever it is. Even if it's a good thing or a bad thing, they need to get it together and that's the only way. I believe that parents could. You know it seems to me that they're working independently ignorantly and that's not good. That's what that. So, that's my that's my piece on that. That makes sense. Okay, absolutely now I see that you basically link one. You know one office with the other. No, I understand you have a valid point and thank you for the clarification as well. So lee can you also, if you feel you know to join, you know to answer that question. Please feel free to share whatever you would like to share with us with each district that my children are in. Schools are doing the best that they can to communicate information. However, I am going to have to agree with the previous speaker in regards to you know the bureaucratic mess and you know excuse my language. This has turned into a pissing contest because it's an election year and yes, we're gonna, be sending by email ali excuse me ali. Can you view yourself? Please? Thank you. Yes, lee go ahead. No, it's fine! You know so they're, not they're, not they're, not they're, not on one accord. There is no unity and there is no final plan. It's kind of like you know, they're hoping for the best, and that's nice you know, but as a realist, there has to be contingency plans and they're kind of winging it, and it shows- and it's poor leadership. It's a poor leadership. Yes well! Thank you well take no guys, because this is important. So what about elisa you wanna? You wanna, share your thought on that how the district you know have responded to this I mean I agree with nadia and with lee. The problem is that as much as you guys, try as much as district 12 gives us information which they do. If we separate just the fact, does the dish provide us with enough information? Yes, the problem is that sometimes that information is absolutely and 100 contradicted a couple of hours later, so the problem is that nobody seems to be on the same page and we get different information from different sources. So, yes, district 12 has sent out a lot of different information flyers. You know things. Yes, they have, but what's the point of district 12 working so hard to keep us the parents in the loop, when you guys tell us like, for example, we were told that on the 21st the children would be returning to school, but on the 11th the children would be returning to school. First, it was september 11. and the 36 schools within the district of district 12 alone had inspectors go out to inspect the ventilation systems. That was great information. What happened literally a couple of hours the same day that district 12 gave us this information. It was completely dismissed, saying that the state does that the city didn't have enough inspectors, that a lot of the schools are not going to be up, and you know into where they're supposed to be, and then now we got to move everything up to the 21st. So it's like yes, district 12 does provide a lot of information, but some of that information is wrong not because of the district simply because it's not be the board of education is not communicating everything you guys can only do so much district 12 can only give us so much information and do so much. It really is up to the board of education and the state to do its job, and I feel like the department of education there's things that should have been done way before corona way before this pandemic even hit. There are things that should have been in place: ventilation systems in case children get sick. The curriculum itself in case there's an emergency, the remote learning, remote learning is not something new, but more learning is something that the department of education has always provided. It's just that they don't because nobody ever asked for it. They never maintained it. So they have no kind of contingency plan to what to do when a certain amount of students need remote learning, which is why we're in the situation we are in. So it's like some things have to be done by the department of education which I feel is completely unreliable, but like district 12 yeah district 12 has been on point trying as hard as they can to give up the information they get as they are receiving it. The fact that it's misinformation is not district 12's fault, it's whoever's, speeding, the information and they're feeding it late or they're, getting the information in late. That's not your fault! You give us what you have and that's all you can really do, and you know at this point, can you be honest and I'm gonna say something completely off the grid? Would the kids really be in such a bad situation if we just close the schools down for the next six months, eight months until this is over? No, I don't think the kids are gonna, be any less educated. If they miss a year of school, I think they can catch up, especially the little ones. We know lots of college students to take a year off of school so that they have a year to breathe. At this point, I don't think that, if shutting down the schools and just shutting everything down for six months, it's really going to make that much of a horrible difference to any of the children. You know I feel like a six months to a year vacation intermission. However, you want to call it it's not going to do that much damage, especially when they're younger, I feel like just pretend like they got left back one year and that's it and let's move forward when it is safe. To do that, I don't understand which is the fun for the kids to get back to school when it's not safe. Well- and thank you for you know, you may have a valid point in your own opinion, but I also would like to add that provided the parents in the absence that let's say that the department will not provide it, then let's say that they closed this school for the entire years. So I think that if that's something that we would have to face, parents will have to take the lead and make take the league and make sure that they provide. You know whatever lesson of classes, you know or should be some kind of arrangement in which the parents will serve as the teachers because granted you may feel that they may not going to miss anything or much. But I think that in such a case the parents should actually take delete that, because then the kids can get very comfy and the idea that they don't have to go to school, and that is not necessary, which in reality is not the case. But it's something like that. Where to happen, I strongly feel that parents should take. You know believe or serve as a teacher to you know, to the to their children, but let's see how this you know is going to play out later on. So anybody else. Let's say: maybe thank you. Lisa gabriella did you want to say something: gabriela remigio, yes, gabriela. What else can I say you want me to repeat the question or no most, of the information we got it from the school because we have been meeting every week. So, okay, all right. I would like to add and go back to what lisa said, making a parenthesis when lisa's referring to district 12- and I know this can be very confusing, but this is 12 is identified for our community board, which, within this 312 is the school district. Six, which is school district, that we are talking about. Yes, school district, six, which is the school district. Six is the office hour since all the school in washington heights kenwood, and I will say if we go as far as to around city college, 137th and broadway in that area, not too far from halle up to 218th street. That's you know our school district. So all right, so, let's see what time it is. I believe, let's move out to the next question that my colleague jonathan jonathan frommer, from a ted. He has a question from attack. I mean jonathan, you want to ask your question, please yeah sure continue with the communication between parents and person from education and the green street, and I can't talk maria. We also want to ask to you parents, if you guys feel that you were informed about the plans that are supposed to be in place to sanitize and clean schools. Let me repeat that in spanish, in fact, okay, let's see naduska, you wanna jump into that question I'll pass on this one, because that goes together with the ventilation. Okay, all right lee. You wanna you wanna answer to that question. Yes, I think I answered it with along with the ventilation issue with regards to sanitation. Yes, I my concerns are probably higher or just as high as the ventilation, because not every school is you know getting addressed. Schools had problems with plumbing and lead, and you know hygiene and sanitation. Some schools couldn't even afford to get soap and parents had to provide soap, toilet paper, etc. So, when you ask, do I feel safe with their plan for sanitation? Absolutely not absolutely not, there's even teachers taking to social media that their classrooms are exactly the way they left them in March plus wrote an excrement yeah. One thing is what we would like to know is that if they inform you guys about the plans they have to sanitize schools, if you are aware of it specific when they, when they addressed it, they said the schools would be sanitized and that they would have protocols they weren't, very specific or detailed as to what they you know what their plan was and again they were barely able to keep the schools clean before covert and they are doing their best. But again it's a resource issue and it's also a manpower issue right. So, even though, just to say something real, quick, remember that the school's sanitation doesn't come from the board of ed the school sanitation is a outsourced company that handles the custodial for each individual school. So that's why I said in the beginning that each principal each school is going to have to really take when it comes to the maintenance of the school they're going to have to take it upon themselves. They can't depend on the board of ed because it's the school that individually hires the outsourced custodial company, so thankfully I feel comfortable in the custodial staff of my school personally, I feel confident in the leadership of my school personally ps128, but I can't say the same for any other school. For example, my son is in high school at martin luther king junior high, and they already called me and told me he's not going to be doing in classes learning for the rest of the year they're going to be remote because their ventilation system is not up to date and it failed. So their martin luther king junior high school will not be having in school learning because they did not pass so he's going to do all remote learning until december and that's what the school's principle notified us of so ps128 is doing good. I have faith in them and their custodial staff. So I feel like at this point every school you're going to have to think about your specific school. Is your specific school doing everything that they can to keep your child safe, regardless of what the department of education wants? Are they doing everything that they can because it's at the end of the day, it really looks like it's gonna come down to the school individually they're gonna have to provide okay very well. Very well so benny I've been waiting for benny to join us, and I don't know what happened. He was with us, but he just disappeared. Benny thought of you. Are you with us? Manny? Are you with us? I guess it's not. I will take one more answer from our parents and thank you lee and elisa for a quick response and gravielle as well. You know what, let's move to the next question I do have. I do have a question myself as well. I would like to, and the question that I would like to ask is- would be that like, given you know all this, the scenario of so many challenges situation that we are facing with the ventilation, with the uncertainty with the reopening of these schools and all you know, and even other challenges that we are not necessarily addressing tonight or discussing them tonight. So my question would be to you guys what suggestion do you have about how the reopening of a school could have been communicated to parents? And let me say this in spanish, because I really want to make sure that everybody, you know, understand clear what the question is so questions. So I think this is very important, so you wanted to you want to jump in hey hello, I'm gonna be answering for her. She had to take a quick call, but I think we, the suggestions we can do for this is really have take time to make the message clear that it's not contradicting with anything that's happening politically and anything that might be happening just overall should be a clear message to everyone and anyone and make sure that the message is going with the ventilation problem. The sanitation problem, like making sure everything is just clear, I guess in a way- and it should be going through email phone and all that stuff. I think everyone should have a chance to hear what's really going on. If that makes sense it doesn't it shouldn't, so it should be. Not only for now the don't get me wrong. Coronavirus is horrible, but it's a really low bar that we set for them to only be cleaning it now. I think the message should be for what's going to be happening now, what's going to be happening in the future, it shouldn't just be something that we can only rely on temporarily. If that makes sense yeah. I think that's very ridiculous and that's a very low bar. We as a community should make sure that later on in the future, if I guess now have the experience that we are more confident and more happy to be able to trust them, if that makes sense, I don't know, but it's not a clear message from here now, whatever I agree with you nadia, I think that we need to look at long term. Well, actually that was. Did you mind saying who was speaking for on the apple idea? Oh I'm, her daughter, I mean I just graduated from a public school, so hearing all this stuff is really good that you guys are talking about it and yeah. That's really good! It's a really good yeah! I was very well successful. Thank you very much yes, so what about lee did you have any suggestion? I think that before they distribute information and like I said, I applaud the community districts for giving the information as it comes. You know everybody wants that up-to-date update and they provide support not only to schools that are reopening, but to parents who are homeschooling and educators who are teaching virtually, especially if they have their own children. They should probably wait until the plan is consolidated and that they are all in one accord. So the question would be: is everybody all in one accord, all three branches of government? The answer is no. Therefore, since nobody is on all on one accord, we shouldn't put the kids at risk or the educators or the the fast flying contractors that are going to come into contact on a daily basis, don't go forward at all. Okay, thank you. Let's see who else benny, it's betty with us still we're still missing him, I'm just waiting for him he's supposed to be with us. I don't know what happened all right. He was on the call earlier, but he's no longer on the call, because his name is not even appearing on the list. Maybe he had internet issues that he got bombed. He didn't rejoin the meeting, he's not on the list appreciate it. Thank you, paola you're, welcome. Thank you, lisa. Is there anything that you wanted to say anything yeah? Well, I agree with nadia's daughter. I feel like this is a learning opportunity and anything that we put in place now should be something that should be long term, not only for coped. We know that covert can come back. We know that, there's flu season, we know that kids get sick at a certain time more than others, we should have contingency plans in place for the long term in case there's an emergency. The school should be able to go from in-school learning to remote learning like that, because they should be in place already. They should already be ready for an emergency, and I feel like we were just not ready. The schools were not ready. Nobody had a contingency plan, nobody thought this might happen. What happens if this happens now we know now. We know that the worst case scenario that can happen in new york is that schools are shut down and that children would have to learn from home. Now we have to work with that and put safety measures in place so that children can still continue their education, even if that's home. Now all we have to do is what the school should do is fix that perfect, that not only perfect, not perfected, but functional make it functional work on the remote learning. We know that in school learning they already have that curriculum packed down. They already know what happens when school. When kids go to school now they should concentrate on. How do we fix this so that it's realistically functional for families and for children? Let's work towards that? Let's have more customer service. Let's have a family welcome center for devices, because not everybody knows how to work a device. Let's have a welcome family sensor that deals with devices. Let's have more bilingual people and let's have someone checking up on these families. I haven't received a call since merch from anybody. Besides my actual school, my principal and my vice principal, I haven't received a call from anybody from the department of ed checking on how I'm doing with the kids how my remote learning is doing. I have a daughter that has nobody called me to find out how she was doing how the remote learning is doing, how the speech therapy is going. So it's like there should be also people that go out to people's houses if they need to help them to help them with the devices to help them with curriculum people that speak multiple language. I have friends that are muslim, that speak arabic. The judges got here, they don't know what's going on. They don't know that much english, it's not only spanish. It's arabic, it's many different languages. We should have someone. We should have a department of the board of education set aside to deal with the people that are doing in-home learning, remote learning that are there to support these families in whatever language they need to be supported, and maybe even just a weekly call. How about just a weekly call at the end of the week? Is there anything that they didn't understand? Is there anything that they need help with? You know just show that you care. I was going to say something about show that you care that you give. You know that you want to help that you're investing in this, that you want to see and your kids be educated and do better. I just see that nobody really cares everybody's just going through the motions and doing the bare minimum so that they can just literally just the bare minimum federal level bare minimum. That's it no come on new york. We got to go above and beyond. That's your motto, so we got to go beyond for our children yeah! Thank you. Thank you, lisa all right. We have you. We have few more minutes and before we move to the next section- and I want to- I want to definitely encourage you guys that in the remaining time that we have for our meeting, if you can think of any other recommendation, so just let us know, I also wanted to share something making a parenthesis that from time to time, you will see that my song has changed, because it's so much noise, where I am right now and sometimes I also have to bend my head to really check on the message that some of my colleagues or folks, you know, send me texts. So I don't want this to be or look as a distraction. No, it's not I'm really! Looking at you and I'm really listening to you, but for because of this situation I have to be looking the phone and so forth and reading materials as well. So, yes, I want to thank you guys for all the responses that you have provided and for volunteers. You know to speak in our meeting, but this is not over yet. So I would like to again encourage you if there is any idea that you come up before that you come up with before the meeting is over, just feel free to to say so, raise your hand or interrupt me. You know softly, so I will gravitate to you and allow you to speak so now I would like to encourage members of my committee if they have any additional questions, any comments I would like for them to definitely to to say whatever you know they would like to share with us, and with that in mind, I would like to call andy our public member ali o guillermo perez, who is also member of this in germany. You wanted to share some of your thoughts with us. Yes, thank you. Thank you on one of the things that yeah. Can you hear me? Yes, we do all right. There were some six important questions at the table and I believe it was a great beginning with this topic. You know, because if you walk thank you the street right now, parents and their community, you go to the grocery store supermarket any place. You go, the topic is back to school, because people are really concerned and there is a lot of questions that is still need, an answer you know and- and I believe that it is very important. My suggestion is that we have a second round this topic on the floor. Yes, I will, I will make that suggestion and yeah. I know for sure if we have the opportunity to connect more parents and other organizations that deal with school, including some parents that have kids on day cares. You know- and I will be very important, because the topic is very hot right now on the score yes and that ventilation issues, and we have a lot of questions. We have so many concerns because I'm involved with a few schools history- and there is a lot to discuss about so many schools- we're not gonna mention any school name on all of that, but many schools that have window problem. As you know, we should have in and out ventilation system on the school and not all of them are working okay, so we get it. We have to be clear on that. Thank you. Yes, it's a very valid point, so anybody else have a comment I wish I can see faces, but everybody for some reason. They don't want to show their faces. Can't you guys I mean everybody was on. You can't see my videos buddy. No, I can't you know. I know you can see me, but I cannot see almost none of you, I'm sorry. If I may, I would like to use that today. It's up to you, okay, yes, who's speaking, yes, gaby. I have a competition here with another gabriela, so I have to and I'm going to be very brave your background, because one of the members speaking and we hear mix mixed messages. Miss conversation. Please hello. Can I have your attention? Please your voice make your computer, please por, favor, it's the right form! Thank you! Okay! So I'm going to be I'm going to be I'm going to be brief and it's okay, it's okay sake of time. So the you know, I very concerned, as you are, even though my son is already 22 in reference to getting ah as a parent as a proud parent of public education. I really know what you're going through in terms of the concern with your children. Unfortunately, this pandemic has, you know, complicated everything and the resources that we have. We as a board, as a committee, is very limited other than listen and in each of everyone's way. Try to help all of you. I just wanna you to know that you are not alone in this. Unfortunately, some of us would like to do more, but I guess we can probably motivate others to do what they have to do, and I know that we have a great leadership in this in this team faye maria luna, which is a leading legend here, guillermo ali perez also and the rest of my colleagues and you know, there's nothing more sacred than your child, that's as simple as it is yeah, even though sometimes children's are just numbers. Well, you know not for us. You know these are our team and you know I commend all the mothers fathers that are doing so much to make sure that the kids are safe in going through all these many difficulties and for those parents, mothers that have special ed kids. Believe me, I I'm with you and I again I commend all of you for your determination of fighting until the last end to make sure that your kids are safe. So again speaking more as a mother than anything else, but as a member of this of this committee in the community board, I want you to understand that we have very limited resources influence, but I think each one of us have some sort of kind of ways to try to see if we can be more healthy. So thank you. Thank you gabby. Thank you. I'm sure that definitely you're not alone on this, and I can conquer enough with you and this and your statement. Absolutely. Although I finished you know with my children, they already grown up, but I still have my grandson and I have my nephews that you know they go to public school. Some of them and I can really understand the frustration of our parents and, like ali or jeremy, said. I think that this is just the first perception we are having to address the problem address in a way that in which we can listen to what the parents have to say, learn from their frustration, learn from their testimony, their experiences and so forth. But I think that since next week is when the big day, let's call it like that the big day is approaching when, where student is going back to to school, those who are going, you know to be inside the buildings or those who choose to be learning or receiving virtual remote learning. So, whichever we need to find out exactly how the DOE is going to how far the DOE is going to deliver, you know their promise, because I personally, I am not really sure that everything is going to be delivery as they are. You know they have promised. I really not, I mean I'm not sure about that, and I'm really very worried about that. So, let's see what is going to happen, and I would like to consider later on to have a resolution after we learn more about the facts and find out whether or not doa is going to fulfill their promise, but we need to educate ourselves and gather more facts about you know how this is going to play out in regards to the the ventilation problems. I wanted to say that, although the solution, basically, according to some of the the reading of research that I came across, it says that the problem, the proper ventilation, has been considered as an important means to prevent control the spread of the of the virus. You know, and also what they are saying, is that as schools with a proper with a proper, what they need basically is a powerful filter that needs to be installed and their hidden system that and their heating and the cooling system to prevent the spread of these virus. So that means that if the uv can come up with the resources and provide those filters into the calling system, I guess that the school should be good to go, but I understand that we probably are talking here. A lot of you know funding for those things, but when come to health, especially the health of our children. I think this is priceless, and this is something that we really cannot be silenced, but we need to continue advocating for these issues. So I want to thank you again and I wanted to encourage to save if anyone else has something to say or to add before we move to the last part of the agenda should be something that we talk about on its own. I think after school is a topic that should be talked about separately, because it's something that a lot of parents need it's going to be difficult. I work with an after school program and we don't know what's going to happen, so I think that's a topic that we need to address as one whole conversation that should be like a whole conference, a whole meeting in itself. Yes, but I think definitely when, like I said before, and thank you for definitely, you know sharing that thought. We really need that we really need a serious and honest conversation about what is going on in our school system. We cannot afford to be signing on. This is a very important issue, we're talking about the health of our students, and let me tell you just to think about that. One of your children or one of your you know kids- can get sick. It's something that I don't even wanted to begin. Imagine so that's why we need to remain vigilant, educate ourselves and be like every day we need to read. We need to research, we need to listen to the news. I know for some people. They may not have the time to read the newspaper or to read or to even watch the news, but we need we all to educate ourselves and really be on top of what is going on. What is the measure saying what the DOE is telling us, especially on the 21st next know next week we really need to know exactly how going back to school of the reopening of this school is going to happen. What exactly is that they? You know how what is it exactly that they are going to do this? Thank you, gabby and elisa. Thank you, maria. Yes, you want to share us a few thoughts with us share your thoughts mariah from youtube. We can listen yeah, we can listen to you. Let me tell you: I have to apologize, don't worry about it! No, because I was in another meeting at the community board. You said so we just crossed houston and I needed to do something there. Also. I just want to tell all of you to that. I'm glad that we are back together and that we are addressing the issues that are extremely important to all of us, which is education, and since I didn't hear the entire presentation, but I I trust all of you if there is any resolution that I miss especially the ones about the elderly people and things like that, but the most important thing is that we have to make sure that our children are safe in school. I don't think we can. We need to take for advances from people who are really not familiar with this type of virus. We need to have a healthy future members of society and by protecting us and thank you faye for your good wills. I am back I'm back here now. Okay, thank you! So much! No thank you maria you always, in my opinion, very thoughtful. You know, and I truly appreciate your thoughts, your opinions and, of course, and the way you know you express yourself and you're caring. You know for our student. I really appreciate it. Thank you, maria anybody else want to say anything else want to add any comment. Yes go ahead. Okay, I apologize. No, don't worry about it. Okay, I was having networking issues with my phone. So that's. Why there's no video, I'm gonna say this for as long as I've been a parent, especially a parent or special needs children. Yes, after school, yes, it should be discussed on its own, simply because the after school has always been a scarce resource even before Covid-19, adequate after school programming and extracurriculars, so that you know parents are able to work and kids are able to get the help that they need after school. This needs to be addressed separately, but I will say this Covid-19 has now exposed or brought more problems to the surface that we were having before some people didn't think it was this bad when in actuality, it's been this bad for a very long time and we're realizing it now because we're in this pandemic. Absolutely! Yes, thank you lee. Thank you! So anybody else. I would like to say that I'm sorry with the person that spoke because lee it seems that this pandemic did uncover something that should have been addressed away before, and that is that is so true. And I- and I just want to emphasize- because I know I mentioned that earlier, but is that the leaders who, whoever these leaders are they need to address or they need to step up to the plate and they need to work together and so that they could convey assurance to the parents to the children to everybody else. That's impacted because the more that they contradict each other, the more that they're not on the same page and they're speaking publicly, because and let it be the d.o.e that has to happen themselves and let's be the political leaders. They have to remove themselves or let it be that they have to sit with the person that they could say one thing or be on the same line. It's something that needs to be done, because this confusion is, it's gonna, be catastrophic. You could say to the well-being of the children and the parents that have to have to deal with this situation for the next couple of months and maybe years, but I think we have to force them to do that. That's it wonderful! Thank you all right. So, let's just move to the the final phase of the agenda. Is anyone listening to this meeting or attending this meeting and have an announcement under the new business which we call it pendientes or suntos, nuevos all a new business? This is the phase in which you will be granted the opportunity to make any announcement. Is there any event that you would like us or the community to know please share with us. Anyone has any any remind everybody about the community fridge. That's now on front of word up on 165 and amsterdam. That is therefore for the community now provided by the dreamers, so you can always go and basically take whatever you need. It's being filled every day is being monitored. If you need anything, you can go to the fridge, you can get it it's there for the community, it's like a community pantry, but it's a big refrigerator and you go you take if you want to donate. If you need you take and it's there for everybody and let's just see how it goes. Thank you. Thank you elisa thank you that was elisa reid. I also wanted to if no one else has any announcement any further announcement. I would like to say thank you to my colleague, jacel montes he's the other founder and also the executive director for international creations, incorporated, which is it's a music school that he actually in which he leads, and I would like to say thank you for joining us. He also is the vice president for the nap, which is the nab, the neighborhood advisory board from the dycd agency. So I want to thank him. I know he's somewhere. Can we see your face gazelle somewhere? Well, in any event? Yes, all right! So, yes, malia! You have a question. You have a comment before we exit maria. I forgot to mention to all of us that are remind people that we still have until september 30th to do the sensors extremely important, no sensors, no money for the children. We need to make sure that you know everyone there and also remind get in touch with robert jackson, because he's talking about reviving the push to get a Cuomo to bring the fund the funds that are the equity, the education equity committee that he had in so many years. That money is not, it hasn't come to us. Yet we need, to put you know, forces together, so the governor come and give us the money. That's it absolutely. Thank you very much good idea. All elected officials should get together and even though it doesn't matter, if you are in state level or city level, they all can form like a joint voices along with senator robert jackson and make the call you know, make the advocacy if you need the folding. But I appreciate that you mentioned that, because actually kylie's not may not be aware of this, you know, can you start contact the office of you know robert jackson and support? You know this advocacy that is so much needed ali? I know you have a comment you want to inject now. No, that was just to motivate that this meeting has a second round, like I said before, and I was thinking about probably having instead of having a night meeting, probably having a meeting saturday morning like a breakfast and opening the meeting to the community, you know to everybody that want to participate, because this information is very important, but at the same time I believe back to school is the main plate at the table right now and we need to promote, and not only that, like somebody said before, keep educating our parents, our community activists and people that are involved with the school about what's going on. But I think we should do something not only at this monthly meeting but calling in a special meeting at least one meeting, probably saturday morning, 11 o'clock in the morning at 10 o'clock. In the morning that people still home and have breakfast with this conference and I'm sure that would be possible when we get over the coffee, because now exactly you know with this regulation that there is certain amount of people that can join that can meet that they have to keep the distance. So no, I'm not saying I'm not saying have it publicly people from home just this type of conference. Oh you mean virtually okay yeah. Yes, all right all right! Yes, okay, that might be a good idea. Definitely maybe it's a virtual breakfast meeting. Yeah virtual is the key word. Yes, thank you lee the virgil all right. I also wanted to now that, to conclude, I would like to formally welcome a new member paradise, phoenix, so paladin phoenix. We would like to welcome to our youth and education committee. If we can see all your face, it will be much appreciated, so my colleagues can continue so she's been appointed to our committee. So and I really want to say thank you so much for choosing. You know our committee. Are you there paradise? Are you there? Can you guys see me? Oh, I can't see you know yes very much focused for some reason. I can't see her. No, can you see me now? Yes, you can see her, but I can't. Unfortunately, I don't know why I cannot see her if you guys can see I'm supposed to see her too, maybe, and also thank you to all the parents for sharing. It's been really interesting, getting the perspective of parents and what you guys are concerned about for your children and yeah people talk to them all yeah, because now I'm interested but yeah. Thank you. Everyone! Thank you! So much and I'm looking forward. You know to see you meet you and also provided this day about our community. So in the work that we've been doing, you know so far welcome again: okay, one very last announcement that I want so just basically to just to keep you informed. As you know, the youth and education committee, it was supposed to be celebrating our youth and police building bridges this year, but unfortunately, because of the pandemic and the climate, you know it's, it has killed, basically the idea and everything or our celebration. So we're still thinking how exactly we are going to continue with this initiative back in March early March a week before the pandemic started, we had a panel, a planning, a planning committee meeting, with a with the 34 community of 24 percent, the 34 and the 33 for prison and also community affairs folks, and we decided that we're going to have the celebration of the day. You know the fifth anniversary in early in early October, but I guess that October is around the corner and again because of the situation against that we have to think of other ways in which we're going to approach or celebrate. You know our fifth anniversary so far this year, I am not sure what direction of which decision we are going to be taking. You know in regards to the youth and police building bridges. Okay, aside from that event, I wanted to tell you that there are two forums coming pretty soon and it's going to be on the homeless. We have part two that we need to conclude homelessness and the mental health, and then we also going to discuss other health issues that I'm still in conversation with differing health agency and soon to be revealed, but I think the next conversation that we're gonna have is going to be a forum on the about the other homelessness and basically to together and update how our youth, and particularly our youth, are doing or doing with this situation. Okay, without said, anybody has any final comments, I guess not all right, so I wanted thank you deeply to our parents, gabriella remigio lisandra medina, elisa reid, even though he didn't get to speak for whatever reason our on behalf of our youth education committee. I thank you deeply and remember. We're gonna have a part two on this. Once we learn what is going to happen after the 21st. Our next meeting is on the agenda. Already. It's already stated. I believe that our next meeting is going to be on October 13th. It's gonna be a tuesday because the holiday, so thank you very much. You know how to get in contact with me.
