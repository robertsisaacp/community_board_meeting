But on the first item in our agenda you will see the reopening of New York, City, public schools and the growing uncertainty, and the item number number three we're going to discuss the ventilation problems.
They have to go for training, professional development and read and readiness to collaborate and prepare for the blended and remote learning that you know supposed to start on the 21st, hopefully so as we're speaking what teachers are doing in just getting ready to start off each other to receive.
It is suspected that teacher will be, will begin to engage in studying and preparation and orientations to help them familiarize to the newest school year, which is very important, as you know, there's many students that they still they do not know even their parents.
And I'm, one of those parents, I'm going to have her tested on Friday, I'm, actually doing coffee, testing , I'm working in the Washington Heights Clinic for the rapid testing And I'm, going to bring her on Friday to have a test before Monday when she goes she's supposed to go to school.
I know they're trying their best, but I'm, not sure if they're getting the proper support and if politics is playing a part in this Is. The first time that we are using a different platform, so it's not soon, which A lot of people are really accustomed to it, but anyway.
Let's start the some of the question How did you feel about the uncertainty that we all are experienced experiencing right, now, going back to school, feeling that the department is not really guiding us?
First question that I have is what were some of the concerns you had as a parent when you heard the school, where reopening so And I'm going to say that in spanish.
Obviously, the fact that the building was prepared to have a proper ventilation, that was one social distances, distancing like to make sure that the children are now all packed up in one room and interacting each other, that they wear their masks or any other protective gear that they need.
I know that some of the issues that the federation of teacher has are bringing up is the fact that the Department of education does not.
It is it's a very you know, even though we want the kids to go back to school, because it's important, but there are some precautions, that, like we have to take into consideration, and she also highlighted about the school not being prepared.
You know they're past A, certain age, point is, I, believe, 45 or 50., and they have a higher chances of having some underlying issue, and you know they're really risking themselves in going back to school.
Although most of the kids could be asymptomatic, like they say, but they run a risk and not having the teachers there mentally working to teach.
Do I have forty thousand dollars for each of their hospital Covid-19 before Covid-19 It was very difficult to determine if a student came to school, sick, all right, usually the time frame for a nurse or a staff member to call a parent, saying, hey come pick up your kid They're sick, it's usually between 11:30 and 1 o'clock.
If somebody was asymptomatic and contagious, managed to pass a temperature check if they had covered, there's a big chance that everybody in that classroom is going to have Covid-19 Yes, and if people have pre- existing conditions and most of us do.
The house was trying to push a bill, which means this is going to affect all 50 states that if you are, if you contract, Covid-19 in school, whether you're a staff, member or student, they are protected from legal litigation for five years, which means if we are coerced to send our children to school.
And I live in the Bronx, but They go to Ps128 and my kids were in school this whole time because they were going to the enrichment, center.
We do not know what's going to happen, but I will be sending my kids to school the two days that they have been assigned.
The department of education as a whole and I feel like it's going to have to come down to the schools.
I feel like the schools are going to have to take the safety measures.
Most of the information I've gotten has been from the news or from the school itself, and even the school itself, there's only so much information that they themselves have, because the department of education is so they're, just not engaged with the parents as they should be, and the teachers, the all they told us about the teachers were that the teachers are going to be tested on a monthly basis.
Are you there I wanted to know how effective was remote learning in your home last year last school year.
If you want me to stay home and be home school and homeschool, my kids, okay, that means I can't work.
We can not accuse the teachers or the school of not doing their part when the department of education is not providing them with what they need.
Ta work, Ta cook, And I got ta clean I know there were a lot of parents were frustrated because I was from home.
We, usually during the summer with the special education children- We could not do in this year because they were home to take you know, breathing and just so because it's difficult I'm, not in her situation.
It is to try to stay on top and make sure that we are taking care of ourselves, and so we can take care of the others, and I agree that if the department wants to do the test, they can do the testing child will take it to the clinic and do it also because we need to we work on getting the best.
My other daughter goes to a hospital based school and because of her needs, you know she had to go back and my concern over there.
There's, also the chance that you're going to have extended health problems because of it all right , Like I said that aspect, you know I'd rather be safe than sorry, because I know I can't afford if they get sick from when I say, sick,, that's kind of sick or If, they die, it's a very unfortunate situation.
The concern like how we're going to make sure that my kids, that graduated really learned everything that they needed to learn to graduate or to go to the next level, because these things will impact them in the future, see my friends and family.
They do not want my kids in their houses because they're going to school, so they feel that, like my nephew, would not be going to school.
So, there's good that a lot of the children are not going to get these services, because already the department of education is saying they will not be able to go to the schools to provide these one- One sessions and Oh may I, say something: okay, briefly, because we have to move, go ahead.
The parents are open to it, where you know like early intervention when they used to have home- based services or when the kid required home- based services, they would send a therapist.
But let me tell you this conversation is going to have a part two, because I really want to know and hear from you and other parents as well.
Okay, my answer with regards to ventilation, PPE contingency and sanitation, and I'm speaking as a former healthcare professional , I'm speaking as a former power professional of the Board of Education, I'm speaking as a parent of special needs, children and an advocate of over 18 years, and I do not feel safe, you do not deserve, and you think that and you At the same time, you feel that other school as well or Paris, another school may feel the same way.
So this like there's some things about the teachers and the principals and the schools that they like they protest, or they want to speak on, and sometimes it gets ignored because whatever budget reasons whatever this is unfortunate, we should not be in this situation where we're trying to attack our kids to a school.
I do not know how or if they want to stop because of this until they get the problem, then let it be, but under no circumstances should children or that be forced to work in a situation where they're not feeling safe.
Yes, let allow me allow me then allow the parents to express themselves first and then the community comes, and you know, appreciate it.
It was completely dismissed, saying that the state does that the city did not have enough inspectors that a lot of the schools are not going to be up, and you know into where they're supposed to be, and then now we got to move everything up to the 21st.
So I feel like at this point every school you're going to have to think about your specific school.
So I think this is very important, so you wanted to you want to jump in The sanitation, problem, like making sure everything is just clear, I guess in a way, and it should be going through email phone and all that stuff.
They provide support not only to schools that are reopening, but to parents who are homeschooling and educators who are teaching virtually, especially if they have their own children.
We know that the worst case scenario that can happen in New York is that schools are shut down and that children would have to learn from home.
The topic is back to school, because people are really concerned, and there is a lot of questions that is still need, an answer.
As, you know, we should have in and out ventilation system on the school and Not. All of them are working.
Let's call it like that the big day is approaching when, where student is going back to to school, Those who are going, you know to be inside the buildings or those who choose to be learning or receiving virtual remote learning.
If anyone else has something to say or to add before we move to the last part of the agenda, I think after school is a topic that should be talked about separately, because it's something that a lot of parents need it's going to be difficult.
I work with an after school program, and we do not know what's going to happen, so I think that's a topic that we need to address as one whole conversation that should be like a whole conference.
What is the measure saying what the DOE is telling us, especially on the 21st Next week we really need to know exactly how going back to school.
If there is any resolution that I miss, especially the ones about the elderly people and things like that, but the most important thing is that we have to make sure that our children are safe in school.
Yes, it should be discussed on its own, simply because the after school has always been a scarce resource even before Covid-19, adequate after school programming and extracurriculars, so that you know parents are able to work and kids are able to get the help that they need after school.
Right now, And we need to promote, and not only that, like somebody said, before, keep educating our parents, our community activists and people that are involved with the school about.
