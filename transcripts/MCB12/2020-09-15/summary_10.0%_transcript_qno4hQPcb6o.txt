But on the first item in our agenda you will see the reopening of new york, city, public schools and the growing uncertainty, and the item number number three Also in public, which is one of the major problems, and you know that the system it's facing after the parents speak and they provide their inputs.
They have to go for training, professional development and read and readiness to collaborate and prepare for the blended and remote learning that you know supposed to start on the 21st, hopefully so as we're speaking what teachers are doing in just getting ready to start off each other to receive.
After you know this wednesday september, the 16th, it is suspected that teacher will be, will begin to engage in studying and preparation and orientations to help them familiarize to the newest school year, which is very important, as you know, there's many students that they still, they don't know, even their parents.
I'm, actually doing coffee, testing , I'm working in the washington heights clinic for the rapid testing And I'm, going to bring her on friday to have a test before monday when she goes she's supposed to go to school.
Let's start the some of the question How did you feel about the uncertainty that we all are experienced experiencing right, now, going back to school, feeling that the department is not really guiding us?
First question that I have is what were some of the concerns you had as a parent when you heard the school, where reopening so And I'm going to say that in spanish.
Obviously, the fact that the building was prepared to have a proper ventilation, that was one social distances, distancing like to make sure that the children are now all packed up in one room and interacting each other, that they wear their masks or any other protective gear that they need.
I know that some of the issues that the federation of teacher has are bringing up is the fact that the department of education-- doesn't they don't have yet the gear to offer the chill the teachers and all the cleaning supplies that doesn't work, but also, I I'm expecting that the parents do their part.
It is it's a very you know, even though we want the kids to go back to school, because it's important, but there are some precautions.
And they have a higher chances of having some underlying issue, and you know they're really risking themselves in going back to school.
Although most of the kids could be asymptomatic, like they say, but they run a risk and not having the teachers there mentally working to teach.
The question asked was what, where some of the concerns you had as a parent as a parent when you heard the school, where reopening okay, And I'm, going to say that in spanish as well, again, abs, so by all mean please.
If somebody was asymptomatic and contagious, managed to pass a temperature check if they had covered, there's a big chance that everybody in that classroom is going to have covert yes, and if people have pre-existing conditions and most of us do.
The house was trying to push a bill, which means this is going to affect all 50 states that if you are, if you contract Covid-19 in school, whether you're a staff, member or student, they are protected from legal litigation for five years, which means if we are coerced to send our children to school.
And I live in the Bronx, but They go to ps128 and my kids were in school this whole time because they were going to the enrichment center.
So, we don't know what's gonna happen, but I will be sending my kids to school the two days that they have been assigned.
The department of education as a whole and I feel like it's gonna- I feel like the schools are going to have to take the safety measures.
Most of the information I've gotten has been from the news or from the school itself, and even the school itself, there's only so much information that they themselves have because the department of education is So, they're, just not engaged with the parents as they should be, and the teachers, the all they told us about the teachers were that the teachers are going to be tested on a monthly basis.
You know all these people are part of staff Are they also going to be tested because they are also part of the school system, the security guards that work there.
If you want me to stay home and be home school and homeschool, my kids, okay, that means I can't work.
Not given the correct tools or the correct technology or platforms to do their jobs, we cannot accuse the teachers or the school of not doing their part when the department of education is not providing them with what they need.
Teacher, a speech therapist, a math tutor, And I gotta work, And, I, gotta, cook, And, I, gotta, clean I know there were a lot of parents were frustrated because I was from home.
We, usually during the summer with the special education, children- and we couldn't do in this year because they were home to take you know, breathing and just so because it's difficult I'm, not in her situation.
My other daughter goes to a hospital based school and because of her needs, you know she had to go back and my concern over there.
You know before you were going to work You know the kids were going to school, And now, they're, not so for people that don't have support systems or a grandmother or an auntie or a neighbor.
The concern like how we're gonna make sure that my kids, that graduated really learned everything that they needed to learn to graduate or to go to the next level, because these things will impact them in the future, see my friends and family.
They don't want my kids in their houses because they're going to school, so they feel that, like my nephew, would not be going to school.
So there's good that a lot of the children are not going to get these services, because already the department of education is saying they will not be able to go to the schools to provide these one-on-one, sessions, and Oh may I, say something: okay, briefly, because we have to move, go ahead.
The parents are open to it, where you know like early intervention when they used to have home-based services or when the kid required home-based services, they would send a therapist.
This conversation is going to have a part two, because I really want to know and hear from you and other parents as well.
Okay, my answer with regards to ventilation, PPE contingency and sanitation, and I'm speaking as a former healthcare professional , I'm speaking as a former power professional of the board of education, I'm speaking as a parent of special needs, children and an advocate of over 18 years, and At the same time, you feel that other school as well or paris, another school may feel the same way.
I, don't know how or if they want to stop because of this until they get the problem, then let it be, but under no circumstances should children or that be forced to work in a situation where they're not feeling safe.
Yes, let allow me allow me, then allow the parents to express themselves first and then the community comes, and you know, appreciate it.
It was completely dismissed, saying that the state does that the city didn't have enough inspectors, that a lot of the schools are not going to be up, and you know into where they're supposed to be, Yes, district 12 does provide a lot of information.
Regardless of what the department of education wants?, it really looks like it's gonna come down to the school individually The question that I would like to ask is- Would be that like, given you know all this, the scenario of so many challenges, situation that we are facing with the ventilation, with the uncertainty with the reopening of these schools and all you know, and even other challenges that we are not necessarily addressing tonight or discussing them.
My question would be to you guys what suggestion do you have about how the reopening of a school could have been communicated to parents?
They provide support not only to schools that are reopening, but to parents who are homeschooling and educators who are teaching virtually, especially if they have their own children.
We know that the worst case scenario that can happen in new york is that schools are shut down and that children would have to learn from home.
The topic is back to school, because people are really concerned, and there is a lot of questions that is still need, an answer.
As, you know, we should have in and out ventilation system on the school and Not. All of them are working.
Let's call it like that the big day is approaching when, where student is going back to to school, Those, who are going, you know to be inside the buildings or those who choose to be learning or receiving virtual remote learning.
If anyone else has something to say or to add before we move to the last part of the agenda, I think after school is a topic that should be talked about separately, because it's something that a lot of parents need it's going to be difficult.
I work with an after school program, and we don't know, what's going to happen, so I think that's a topic that we need to address as one whole conversation that should be like a whole conference.
Next week we really need to know exactly how going back to school.
If there is any resolution that I miss, especially the ones about the elderly people and things like that, but the most important thing is that we have to make sure that our children are safe in school.
Our community activists and people that are involved with the school about what's going on.
One very last announcement that I want so As you know, the youth and education committee.
