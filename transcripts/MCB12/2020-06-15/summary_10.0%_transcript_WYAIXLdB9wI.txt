I would add the two black men who just found home in California In my report, I like to again in the same wavelength, continue to commend and congratulate those of us who have been directly participating in the march, and the protest is that I've personally, my health has allowed me to We need to continue on until things get to a point in which there's some sort of equality and evenness police brutality manifests itself in different ways as you've.
Very I know you have questions regarding the IRT budget, but I deferred that with the Treasury report, we're gonna do that later What is the question, and this might be more appropriate for an offline conversation with you and the treasurer, but I'm just curious, given that we have like a pretty substantial budget surplus, would it be appropriate for the community board to buy like a bunch of first of all, it?
I believe one of the partners I'm working with 40,000 Matt's for the mayor's office, so I believe, if you put together a proposal there, they're giving I know that they have a star called a stockpile of PPE Okay, but I'm also interested in like trash grab her garbage bags, but we'll talk okay, so she can give us a couple of no proposals and quotes from organization or places Yes, oh good evening, to thank companies, our first sending information last Friday According to the crystal report.
My question is more around because I'm trying to work with there was a great email that Francisco one of our one of my committee members spoke on even I'm, being able to formalize a way of being able to identify and bring trainings to a lot of those small businesses here to start developing some sort of plan to be able to address racism in anti-blackness with the office of demanding Williams , so I think that summer is a particularly good time to have these kinds of meetings where we're doing informational sessions and we're not passing resolutions or conducting official business.
Two four just feel free contact me It's important that she's yeah, but in addition generally, the executive committee is only participated in by the members of the executive committee, but you know we can accept additional stuff, but and Domingo I just want to let you know that what's happening in the chat is Mariela Graham in terms of a question now We made that decision on our last community However.
I'm gonna be very brief and turn of my report I wanted you to share with you, as many of you already had witness, or so you know in our meeting, our committee decided to have an informative discussion to learn about the experiences that many students, parents and community in general had or have been impacted with the you know, Kobe night in so we call up for a meeting in collaboration with the Department of Youth and Community Development, specifically with a committee which they called the neighborhood Advisory Committee Well I am also part of a committee What we wanted to intern and in collaboration, bring the conversation to inform the community.
Really wanted to I want to insist in expanding our relationship throughout the community and with other city agency, because I really consider very important for the kind of work that we do, that we continue are trying to engage in and building our relationship with many now besides, like Cut the internet and Wi-Fi to the students up will be taking summer classes so I Can, we go into the debate This is my report.
You know aspects that are directly related to their committee, but also at the time in February, the environmental and traffic reports were not yet finished, so we had some time the applicants met with those three committees in May and at the June land use committee meeting we got a Now. The traffic portion of the environmental society has to be signed off by New York City do T The committee voted to approve the application, which is basically just an application to use the building for a school, but that resolution was subject to DEP s, approval of the remediation plan and do T's sign-off on the traffic component of that.
We also recommended that the applicants continue to provide updates to Committees of the board as the project progresses and as operations are know: local, community-based organizations and schools and business organizations.
Right now had discussion about things going on in the community for seniors talking about the cooling centers to be open, but then I understand subsequent to our meeting that there's a possibility that they're not going to open the schools and flux at the moment, they're providing air conditioners for low-income families or communities for those that do not have a working air, conditioner, functional air conditioner, starting with nights of buildings, At the stores and banks and post office, and that sort of thing and seniors having difficulty waiting in lines.
We did wind up having a passing a resolution What is wrong with me and we will be meeting again as I said next month, so that we can continue to have this conversation about parks usage, and there are a lot of enforcement issues that are all fairly obvious: It's really great that so many people have figured out constructive and forward-moving ways to integrate civil unrest.
It is more of a fall thing, most likely, but It's gonna be a community like elected officials, CB 12, the public small business owners, which are a big piece of this You , know again, if you think about Broadway between 180, first between Broadway and Amsterdam, so there's not a date for that.
Maybe it would be over the summer, but you know that kind of like workshops, so that again all stakeholders, but they're kind of planning to do it in one like with all the different constituencies , We thought about all right:: let's get them on the TNT agenda, That's, just not the way it's going to go, although we may have They are small business They are the fact that this stretch sort of relates to two major highways and access to two major highways in the world's busiest bridge, and it also links to you know it's hard to sort of just take that strip without considering all the activity of bus turnarounds on 178 and 179, and that this board approved a resolution that related 278 but So. This is a very big one and there is going to be and need to be a lot of public process around this, because there's not and then just coming back to a cedras question about the traffic study that was part of this, the wind charter, school proposal and anybody sort of I.
The wind school I really want to see some type of environmental assessment study me on What's going to happen when it first goes to the combinational things here right further , you have a brawny hotel is going to open up on Amsterdam office tower retail space Broadway target is coming to one of the first and say: Nicholas gee-pole is going to come to one area and Broadway Now we need to see because this community has been affected by one of the largest freight in asthma and diabetes rate that can be ultimately linked related to this traffic that is going on underneath our soil, which is 95 5 route If. This traffic is going to be out, we'll be out there first to all the areas that can create more traffic opposition to our neighborhood.
They came up with a great resolution that I'll be sending out to the office staff on Wednesday or when it comes to accountability and just the time so I'll be sharing that on Wednesday with everybody and just make sure that when it sent out just in case there are some final edits just make sure you paid the lookout for that Besides that, that's my report, I feel that understanding the importance of safeguarding our small businesses We also have to inform ourselves on what type of resources with type of kids, but we could develop within our community to make sure that we safeguard it and that we use all the tools available to be able to just make sure that folks are not just pimping our community and coming in here and taking advantage of it What's really important is when there are.
What I said is we need to pay attention to when there are public dollars coming into projects, because that really becomes the leverage, the rationale toward the community board through elected officials, to provide and asked if I am building a building with my own money and with you know, a loan from Citibank You know, that's a different situation that, if I'm getting a low-interest loan through the state-- and you know other benefits through the city, though there are a lot of developments to get a fair amount of public assistance in their financing and are not really asked to give anything back.
The reason behind it was that I was invited to a meeting that the congressman was holding with the tower hotel What was it that they were promising, because when people start coming into spaces to communities talking about, we want to transform this.
Well, you're a business you're coming in and we don't like you because you're a business if we're gonna slap you over the head , I think it's about creating processes that are transformative and actually engaged our community and make sure that we safeguard our community because I'm assuming as communities community board members, we were looking to be able to make sure that we're at the at the interest of our community and not at those of those elected officials who get voted into office and have their own interest.
We should be safeguards of our community I like to just point that out in Ysidro a question for you Eli concerning the new licenses that are going to come in July and August There's a session that would have to pretty much be made by the executive committee as far as signing off on any potential July business license.
We had a licenses, two of which, when you one was for restaurant wine was which are always trying to account to 187 and FeliCa license coming to 10th Avenue You know it's unfortunate that, for a variety of reasons we weren't able to get to your March resolutions in March That doesn't feel like a whole lot of business Are. You saying that the SLA has not acted on any of those applications that your committee considered in March?
All you have to do is send a letter to City Hall I got previously stated and as for the amount and what your distribution is gonna be, and somebody from the mayor's office will contact you and that you know how much you could get right and the question is having dispensing machines so that we don't have to have people dispensing them.
Sorry and my point Ysidro is this-- is for the street distributing them to residents because, as everybody knows, from Scotts English report, we have the fourth highest number of essential workers in Community Board district 12 You have in report Please encourage your committee members to subscribe to the channel, because I haven't still same people asking for some links of previous meetings to do by you know to write or to listen again.
I've been talking with some of the individuals who either have been part of it or want to be in looking at what we can do in a summer like this for an end-of-summer event, whether this of it is we've got through this summer in spring or whether it takes another tone Those discussions are going on at this point and while I don't see a July, Executive Committee meeting, your report to I will stay in touch with LA, consistent discussions.
