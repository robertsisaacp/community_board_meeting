My health has allowed me to We need to continue on until things get to a point in which there's some sort of equality and evenness police brutality manifests itself in different ways as you've.
My report is just basically to try and motivate us to continue on and just try and get the police department throughout the United States of America That's pretty much my report, The first thing I'm very happy to inform- is that once again in June, all the committee met real tually.
Let's see what we can come to address this matter, because it's unprecedented, you know we have it in the summer, but this year is going out ahead.
That report earlier is better in the new fiscal year to have some time to talk about it, but you know certainly on the budget.
You wanna want to discuss that, or is there any other community committee chair that would like to have a meeting during July, except maybe for the licensing?
What would be the process because I want to work with he's, even I'm, being able to formalize a way of being able to identify and bring trainings to a lot of those small businesses here to start developing some sort of plan to be able to address racism in anti-blackness With, the office of demanding Williams So I think that summer is a particularly good time to have these kinds of meetings where we're doing informational sessions and we're not passing resolutions or conducting official business, but we're doing that thing that actually community boards do best, which is networking and brainstorming and getting in for pushing information out to the public.
Four just feel free contact me It's important that she's yeah, In addition, generally, the executive committee is only participated in by the members of the executive committee, but you know we can accept additional stuff, but and Domingo I just want to let you know that what's happening in the chat is Mariela Graham.
Be very brief and turn of my report I wanted you to share with you, as many of you already had witness, or so you know in our meeting.
Our committee decided to have an informative discussion to learn about the experiences that many students, parents and community in general had or have been impacted with the you know, Kobe night in So. We call up for a meeting in collaboration with the Department of Youth and Community Development, specifically with a committee which they called the neighborhood Advisory Committee.
Is that I really wanted to I want to insist in expanding our relationship throughout the community and with other city agency, because I really consider very important for the kind of work that we do, that we continue are trying to engage in and building our relationship with many now besides, like Cut, the internet and Wi-Fi to the students up, will be taking summer classes and I personally feel very worried about that and I.
The environmental and traffic reports were not yet finished, so we had some time the applicants met with those three committees in May and at the June land use committee meeting we got a Now. The traffic portion of the environmental society has to be signed off by New York City do T.
You know community facility coming to the area at this juncture, occupancy of the building is slated for September 2022 concerning the West 158 street row house district A bit and landmarks has not been all that supportive of the issue with not great reasons, some of the new research that is interesting as we've looked at or the parties who are doing.
Right now had discussion about things going on in the community for seniors talking about the cooling centers to be open, but then I understand subsequent to our meeting that there's a possibility that they're not going to open the schools and flux at the moment , they're, providing air conditioners for low-income families or communities for those that do not have a working, air, conditioner, functional air conditioner, starting with nights of buildings, At the stores and banks and post office, and that sort of thing and seniors having difficulty waiting in lines.
You know ideal to have a first line of communication with both of those guys and we can in our aid managers tree with it, so that even you know take it to the extent of maybe using some local social media guys to in the question to highest chamber of commerce also distributed so that they can get the message out that he can just be from nine to ten, which I think is usually the norm in a 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. they should do.
We want to make sure that you know this resolution was specifically crafted, so is to acknowledge really the hardship that's being had right now in our community afterwards.
We want to make sure like how do we keep moving forward with a conversation about how different people who view what is or isn't, an appropriate use of parks, figure out how to use those spaces together without weaponizing or criminalizing what is otherwise reasonable, Behavior?
Was able to respond to the people in the meeting to confirm that the signage was there while I was there You know what the last thing anybody needs is: a white lady, rolling up to a group of people saying hey, you're, being a little too loud.
However, they won't have time to go through the maps on a detailed basis, so they're up there available to the public, but they're not going to go through one by one by one in the way they did at the committee So far, most of the discussion at the meeting and most of the diss comments.
It is more of a fall thing, most likely, but It's gonna be a community like elected officials, CB 12, the public small business owners, which are a big piece of this.
They are the fact that this stretch sort of relates to two major highways and access to two major highways in the world's busiest bridge, and it also links to you know it's hard to sort of just take that strip without considering all the activity of bus turnarounds on 178 and 179, and that this board approved a resolution that related 278, but This is a very big one and there is going to be and need to be a lot of public process around this, because there's not And, then just coming back to a cedras question about the traffic study that was part of this, the wind charter, school proposal and anybody.
We're, not the first ones, and ours is more complicated, I'll just refer people to will make the you know you can go to New York City gov to the D-O-T site on the bike share section and take a look about where stuff is exactly, and this was sort of a long.
I did throw that link up into the chat, so people Hank I, think the effect of the bus way is going to be enormous as compared to whatever mess No more questions from on mind Debbie for such an informative report, Domingo.
The rationale toward the community board through elected officials, to provide and asked if I am building a building with my own money and with you know, a loan from Citibank You know that's a different situation that, if I'm getting a low-interest loan through the state- You know other benefits through the city, though there are a lot of developments to get a fair amount of public assistance in their financing and are not really asked to give anything.
So I think need to be mindful of the financing of the public benefits, because that we can, then you know legitimately, tie some kind of a community benefit.
What was it that they were promising, because when people start coming into spaces to communities talking about, we want to transform this.
If target is just building something as of right, is they don't need to come to the community, board?
They received a discretionary zoning or Latino, and there If you want to appeal to the goodwill and of a business, to say that they should work with the community and provide some benefits when they move in then great.
I, think it's about creating processes that are transformative and actually engaged our community and make sure that we safeguard our community because I'm assuming as communities community board members, we were looking to be able to make sure that we're at the at the interest of our community and not at those of those elected officials who get voted into office and have their own interest.
We should be safeguards of our community I like to just point that out in Ysidro a question for you Eli concerning the new licenses that are going to come in July and August.
I think I, wish you consider sometime in the summer, And it's something that we would not be manageable, particularly important to have meetings virtually, because that's going to add up a green number of questions.
So I'm, looking forward to see if we can address this question in the summer time, because I think is critical and The. Second question that I have is concerning the minutes and there were solutions that were passed by the resident committee.
I would say we need to have at least just like all the committee's a July and a special July meeting to look at those licenses, at least just to make sure that they pass something that we can do.
Yet I think that the community board should vote on that in this month in June and not wait until July, because by the time they'd be able being put on the agenda for the SLA.
You know it's unfortunate that, for a variety of reasons we weren't able to get to your March resolutions in March That doesn't feel like a whole lot of business.
All you have to do is send a letter to City Hall I got previously stated and as for the amount and what your distribution is gonna be, and somebody from the mayor's office will contact you and that you know how much you could get right And The question is having dispensing machines so that we don't have to have people dispensing them.
You have in report Please encourage your committee members to subscribe to the channel, because I haven't still same people asking for some links of previous meetings to do by you, know, to write or to listen, again, basically, just encourage and to subscribe to the to the channel, which is NYC, em, semi, 12m, NYC, and if its own, on Facebook page is my C cynical family So, don't like direct people to the bottom of the page.
Those discussions are going on at this point and while I don't see a July, Executive, Committee meeting, your report to I will stay in touch with LA, consistent discussions.
Some mention of that earlier and I just stayed focused on community board stuff a little bit because I there haven't been a lot of those reports.
As we talked about last month, has a lot more members, and second I noticed that some of the videos are not on the YouTube channel, like our last Health and Environment meeting.
As some people may have said, and we also want to make sure that, as far as the public gatherings, there are two different things: operating.
