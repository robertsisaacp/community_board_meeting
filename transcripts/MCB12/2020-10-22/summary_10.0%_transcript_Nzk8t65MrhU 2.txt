So we're going to switch it up a little by sort of like making it more informational towards the newer members and those of us, and I'm going to include myself, who do not necessarily comprehend the entirety of what the budget ranking process is, and it's important What that what the should be pointed priorities purpose of the process, we're also going to create an opportunity for the committee chairs to educate the public on the items, including ranked, and we're also going to explain our fellow board members and how to submit those rankings, especially in this now technology world of ours, the zoom world, how we're going to do the voting, the electronically and so forth.
We are planning for fiscal year 22, and this process has started in June this year by having the local budget consultation, where the community board can have a consultation with the city agencies asking what they need et cetera, et cetera.
What should be number one number two number three among all the capital recommendation that we have from the ten committees and also you're going to rank what is most important for you from the expenses that have been listed by the committees, then we're going to do a tally, we're going to do a survey and we're going to do a process where we're going to sub every voting.
Who has the majority vote at a particular time of the items, and also I need to bring to your attention that for the last five years, this process has been unified in one process under the city planning, agency.
We need what are the most important items for the Community Board, and it has a process that we have been working: Eliza, And I.
So they are really for the first time that I've been involved, trying to make an effort to get not just the staff and the chair and the executive people are just committed chairs, but do not want every single board member to understand the process and the follow- up is also critical.
I do not know if ebenezer can testify to that, but this is the first time that I'm sort of like more involved, but I see a difference in as to how the city is more involved in making sure that we all get are part of the process and the follow- up, which is just as important as the process itself just to follow up on Sally's point.
I do not know what happens on other committees, but on our committee we have a representative from the Parks Department and presumably we would have representatives from the other agencies that are relevant to other committees, saying these are what our priorities are and explaining why they think one particular project or program is more important or less important than other projects or programs.
It's easier to just track and follow, but it's not a particularly meaningful number other than indicating that OMB is aware that we have added it as a priority and carrying a descriptor of what fiscal year it's in, and whether it's a capital project or an expense.
You can always ask me how much more time you have, but please respect the five minute limit, because we're trying to be fair to all chairs- He just needs to kind of like let the process fall through a little all right.
A number of your items relate to sort of public safety enforcement in parks or their parks issues, but to really public safety, which is why they're, not in my committee, there and Your committee, have the opportunity to talk at all about cameras in parks which needs to be through the public safety and through the pd, because it requires the NYPD to install the equipment and to monitor it, because that's not something parts has the capacity to do.
So, the the land, Use Committee had only one expense and one capital item for last year's budget, and we were pleased that the board as a whole ranked each of those items in the top five and feel they are still relevant and made slight tweaks and resubmitted them for the upcoming fiscal year.
It calls for the allocation of capital funds to support a development initiative in Washington, Heights and Inwood, whereby vacant city owned lots and buildings are packaged in one or more rfps dedicated to scattered, site, infill, affordable and the word affordable was added this time before it simply referred to infill residential projects, for which affordability is defined by the area.
We can begin to address the dire need for affordable housing in the community, and those are the two land use items you have about a minute and a half for questions.
12 is parkland, so if you think of it from that perspective, it's actually appropriate for the majority of our projects to come from this committee and for this board to rank to highly rank many parks projects, because this is the only way that parks sort of gets its funding.
First, all right, starting your time, steve, all right, so the health and Environment Committee has the 11 expense items number one which has been our number one priority for the I think, the last six years and during that period has been the board's number one priority several times is to expand mental health services in the community.
This year, we're at the urging of the committee on the aging We're, emphasizing the fact that these services are needed, especially for seniors and others, whose mental health and Social engagement have been adversely impact by the Covid-19 crisis.
Next one is a repeat from last year: increased funding for education and outreach on recycling, reuse and composting, as well as the proper disposal of household garbage in our community, which which, if, if done effectively, would help reduce some of our problems with overflowing trash baskets on especially on commercial streets and the last one is to create an educational campaign about the federal public charge rule to inform immigrants of their rights to obtain health services and other benefits this rule has been.
A lot of work has been done on this issue in the last two years, but we still have in several areas some old water mains and sewer lines that do need to be replaced and our other two items are to provide additional garbage, collection, trucks and street sweepers with snow plows and to install green infrastructure such as bioswales to divert storm water from the sewer system And, and then we have one, which is an old item which you do not have to rank, which is because it is funded in the city budget.
Yeah see the second and third one same thing so on the Excel sheet, it's duplicated, but on the survey monkey, it's not so it's fixed where people need to vote, except that there is a third item that you know is not there and that's the one I was asking for.
Okay, increase funding to expand services at senior centers in Cb12 M to include hiring additional social workers and program coordinators, adding meals, extending hours, increasing per meal reimbursement rates.
Just, actually here number two item ranking item in last year's expense, budget.
So, the first item increase access and outreach to healthy cultural, appropriate food for seniors with medical needs; That's a revision from last year, because we wanted to include culturally appropriate food number two increase: the expansion in the program, expanded in- home services for elderly persons, funding to provide affordable home care, including sliding scale reimbursement.
Some of the agencies are outrageously expensive in terms of getting home care, especially for for those that happen to have a bit of money and have to self- Pay number three: increase funding to expand services at senior centers in Cb21 to include hiring additional social workers and program coordinators, adding meals, extending hours, increasing per meal reimbursement, rates.
Increased funding for naturally occurring retirement communities to support, currently unfunded mandate for nursing, hours, we'd like to see these norths as they're known as continue, because they provide some greatly needed services and areas to allow seniors to age in place and number six other than personal services.
But you know the Can in terms of how many hours that they can fund a nurse to be available, Can I, just say one quick thing sure shout out to Steve for including the seniors and the mental health services.
You're, next, just really quickly for members of the public, feel free to use the Q&A as each chair presents and after we go through each committee, chair, we're going to open it up for new items because, as you're noticing.
We've provided increased funding for aep and ppp programs for the preservation and rehabilitation of distressed buildings in Cd12 M, and also added an additional item of providing internet access and publicly available spaces, including hra service, centers.
We have seen both the limitations as well, not to mention the greater need for this very service, and so we want to make sure that was the top we've asked for providing funding for the home based program in Cd12 M, providing more funding for food pantries, which was brought forward to us by our health and Environment Committee Chair Steve, Simon.
You and we've also included some items in relation to supportive housing for Lgbtq youth, increasing the funding for more HPD housing code and DOB building code inspectors increasing really what is Educational, resources, letting tenants know about what their rights are and also providing for.
With that, I'd like to pass along my time to Martin Collins, who was asked to speak a little bit more to his concerns on the issues before we go quick question, a quick observation, capital budget item three in aging and capital budget item 11 in housing and human services is the same, and I would recommend that they be combined to one of the other, which means the board gets another item to vote on, as opposed to splitting votes between tasks that are the same.
He Ariel did pass it towards one minute and thirty seconds and there's more cool Martin, okay, on the capital budget, providing funding for the construction of 100 permanent, affordable housing based on community district 12's average median income to not, for, profit organizations and community land trust that are partnered with not- for- profit developers is essential.
It was an observation that we have a duplication between the aging committee and housing and human services, the same, and so we know that technically there is a cut off on how many expense items we get and how many capital items we get, If, there's a preference in terms of if it's listed under aging or listed on their house, we can just remove we'll, remove it from the survey monkey and from the one which one do you want me to talk, about.
Is there anything included, and I apologize, because I can't see the expense list right, now, but directly addressing homelessness serving the homeless population, given that we do not have housing for them or given that needs might come up like portable showers, portable toilets, that kind of stuff the home base is specific homeless people without homes, Home bases is specifically one of the areas in which we've, at least in my time, serving in city, government.
Let's start with the expensive item number one priority for our committee is provide funding for to improve the connectivity option of internet oops.
Former priority is the needs for Esl and ell programs in our district, meaning provided funding for second language speakers, learners and also for people with other languages as well.
I think this is something that is very important: Providing funding to increase child care in this 312 to help children develop essential skills like, for example, social and emotional communication, skill, which is so much needed in this time that we are you know facing with this pandemic, so they also will need the they need to succeed in school and live as well.
It's such a such a paramount issue for everyone who uses New York, City Transit, but certainly in our district- We talked about even making this our only capital priority, but we just decided to rank it one and keep some of our other things and which were rehab on the a train stations at 181 and 168, and the one train at 207Th Street.
You, know what we hear from the committee and from the community and what we're sort of responding to throughout the year and align that with these expensive items.
The second point, I wanted to just wonder how we are getting these budget things to the public, so they can see, because I think it would be very hard for people to see this like first in the meeting or something and then try to make sense of it to even ask a question or even know how to ask a question or even understand what any of this is, because even some of us are on the board and we've seen it.
What has been brought up all year right into the budget, ranking and priorities, and I think we can So just and just briefly, I do understand the issue and the complexity with the federal.
If there's a way that we can combine that, but I would something I would stress, is within combining it, making it quite specific to state to include public schools, Nursing Homes public spaces, something to that effect My second point would be- You know be addressed in the section later when we open it up to members of the public Are we or how are committee chairs and committees in general, scanning?
There was a comment in the Q&A where it says here some of the council members allocated all their capital funds to internet issues in public schools.
Thank you for clarifying that for people I've also mentioned there are a couple of other issues and apparently they're not for this evening, but there are other issues that the public has an interest in the ring garden Got 50,000 grant from the borough president three years ago and OMB is preventing us from using it, and you know the community board could be helpful in helping to release these funds to the to the garden.
So I just want to speak out and say that you know we make a difference in people's lives on a daily basis as well- We are part of the fabric, and culture needs to be supported equally as traffic lights and whatnot.
I have to say thank you Alex and for folks that need to know the hispanic society's line item is on parks and cultural Affairs, Capital, Catherine We have three people, then we can do three minutes each one My question is to debbie, with the traffic and traffic transportation request for funding to do a traffic study on 165Th to 170th.
Needs, and, if you I would, I, would not want to see the board members divide their votes between these two items, because I'm hoping that we'll be able to keep mental health at the top of our priority list once again.
Right, yes, I think it's okay, but I'm wondering also that if it's some way we can show, because every year, I'm losing most of everything that has to do with health, and you know, I would like to show that we also are on that issue as well.
You know thing that it has to do with health, and I would like to show that our committee also is advocating for those issues as well.
