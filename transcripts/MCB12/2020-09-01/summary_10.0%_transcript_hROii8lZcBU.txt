You want to promote whom Chris Nicholl Senator Jackson's office looking sharp, like always hey, how's it going committee?
We have my opening remarks: approval of agenda, small business, testimonies, I'm, going to be removing tara.
I have two businesses that reached out to know sorry for Mama Sushi to express to talk about a situation of harassment that she's currently experiencing by by individuals and elise caballero from I open optical, who wanted to speak on certain inconsistencies that she found within the distribution of funds from hispanic Federation, and she would like to understand a bit better.
I. Think it's extremely important for us to understand what type of negotiations were done and what are the agreements that they have had like that they had with our elected officials as well as with past committees.
I know this is everything is evolving, so I just wanted to just make sure you know so that we're when we bring in people that we're hearing like a diversity of voices from the business owners in our community Just want to make sure because there's so many different business owners here of different races and ethnicities and things, and I just want to make sure that their voices are in there and represented and I just wanted to make sure that we're cognizant, and so when we're pitching people.
If you know I'm sure all of us, of course, are helping to bring some of these people in, or at least we should and when we're thinking about that.
Think about the wide diversity of the small business owners in our community, and you know and making sure that we are representing all of those voices.
And I think, like that's all responsibility, that we all have to bring upon ourselves as members of the committee once the agenda I'll personally take responsibility for the short.
But I also think it's very important that when we want to be constructive, not destructive, you know so like if you feel somebody's missing.
So I have a question: I'm, not if this is the place for it, but when I think about just collaboration within a Business Development committee, I, wonder, And I do not know where is the place for it, but if there is already something in place or if it's possible, that this be some kind of year- long project about how we encourage collaboration amongst businesses.
That may be some that are more successful than others, especially given like the current climate, where I think, like technology uptake of some businesses, probably puts them at a greater advantage than other businesses, and I wonder where the community you know, and so it could be like acrosss different sectors.
Restaurant wants to help like necessarily right, like the competition right next door, but other like cross kind of cross- interest, businesses, and I mean part of my interest in the Business Development Committee was thinking about collaboration and sharing expertise, so I do not know where that lives in this committee, but I just wanted to raise that So Covid-19 really like changed everything.
What we're trying to do is just readjust assess and then just figure out what we could do in the in the time period that we have, which is, I, would say, till December which, when the next election is for the Community Board chair, and then we just figure out what the next year's agenda is, and we were also going to honor during women's history.
We, were going to honor 12 community board, 12, 12, women, business owners, and so that got squashed too, like if domingo said, everything that was supposed to happen in March just could not happen.
It's not that it has to happen all the time, but I honestly thought that our service, when the beginning of this pandemic and when ppp loans, ppp loans started rolling out And, then you did a great job, organizing that domingo We did not know how bad Covid-19 was going to be.
I know that the city now has a like a mediation system between businesses and community members.
We got ta figure out how it's going to work now, because it's very interesting, but we do have about 200 businesses that provided their email in our in our events during the pica Covid-19, who we could reach out to in the future.
So I think that's something that we have to hold some sort of like town hall or conversation around, because I think that's going to impact a lot of our small businesses being that we are so heavily restaurant influenced , Domingo I promoted again the cell phone before she should be available to talk to China.
So individuals who do not live in the community, some looking for some sort of way of bringing down local businesses for whatever interest they try to uphold, like regulations What type of support city agencies are providing in order to be able to to develop that understanding, E, the SLA, I think the SLA is more because of the Ma, the governor, I'm sure the governor has a lot of pressure of on the SLA right now, because the situation that transpired in Queens and then making sure that does not happen.
That is, you know, I, feel like we've been attacked and because all the people wait and if everything that happened up here is called that imam.
It's really sad, because we know that the people who are doing this do not want to see these businesses prosper right, But, you know, that'll be something that the police should take over, because I think that it's really messed up, and then those businesses like Susana, Susana's, soleil and many others that do adhere to restrictions and the policies set by the city.
Yes, and I think that it comes back to the importance of licensing and business development working together, at least in.
You know the weaponization of 3- 1- 1, but also being able to speak on how there's certain A lack of guidance is provided to small businesses, lack of support from city agencies to be able to bridge that connect of understanding what compliance is and is.
A lot of these businesses are not going to survive a winter without indoor dining or some sort of compromise that the city's willing to let science sharing codes or stern guidelines to be able to compromise and be able to figure that out, because right now the mayor's logic is that there's certain people that are not going to be that are not going to be that are not going to have access to indoor dining, but the logic has always been.
It's just harassing from a couple of people, Like I say it's not a whole bunch of people Is that it's a couple of people that they have good contact They know how to how to how to how to get to those big people that want to hurt us.
Troubling, and I hope that you know these things will change, but it's mostly the state that is enforcing the regulations, and Summonses to business that are just coming out of pandemic Assuming they go on patrol they try to find.
Everything started there when I asked a park, if I can put all those memorial right in front of our establishment but acrosss the street in the park that lady from the park But how come I'm going to throw away all this value, art that All these young kids from this neighborhood?
I like to be know very well in this community as a person that work with this community.
You know we had another chance, a chance in life to survive We hear you Susanna, and the most important role that we could play is trying to figure out how we communicate and really try to see how we could like speak to the to the speak, to the proper resources, to make sure that we work together as a community and solve a lot of these issues.
That's, how they perceive living within the inner city, but I also think that we have to figure out how to work together as a community and because it's going to be a lot of troubling months coming ahead.
Everybody in the city is copying that you know But like what I would say is I learned this at a very young age, but haters are going to always hate And you're understanding that your business does impact your immediate surroundings and you're able to put systems in place that that's able to make sure that you you're covered.
It's like guilt by association, because you're just in the same vicinity and they're doing stuff outside of your business, What I, want to say is, I think, what's missing in this conversation, And I think that's going to be important element is addressing those people who are doing these things, because until we address the knuckleheads, the bad players, the people that are outside your business doing this nonsense.
If someone people going to just associate you with stuff knuckleheads are doing outside of your business after you're closed, I can tell you an example where I am outside.
It's outside people, and It very well may be- We need to, as a committee also address knuckleheads and fools busy running around disturbing this community, make giving businesses like yours a bad name by going out there acting a fool outside of your establishment that needs to be addressed.
There was some questions that we will about seems like there's a lot of people worried about awnings safety on the streets.
They've asked it like 20 times so that means they must know this page, because that was the same thing that the page was attacking me about that the awning has a big hole that by the fire, Department.
The community board should have been involved in this committee, because I I'm sure, the mingle that you will know a lot of businesses that, because you are on the ground.
What's the new business, let's see, I was thinking that you already talked about this, but just that we discussed at open restaurants, open streets.
