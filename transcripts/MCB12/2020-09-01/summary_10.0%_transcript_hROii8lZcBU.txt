One of our kids got killed this summer in the Bronx I wasn't going to do anything this summer, but So, I'm thankful for this short agenda because I'm, tired Now they pushing the date back ten days, and you know what's crazy that everybody was informed today like seeing the mayor speak, that's when everybody found out the first They and people who work with these kids should be the first to know You now I hope these people are safe because that's insane , but are they a member of your committee?
I mean, there's just so much anxiety around reopening and all summer I think it was just thinking about what was it going to look like you know, and every week passed and do you work in a school I work at in ps132 I used to work at 528 right across the street but that's where I was a teacher.
Only from sister's bookstore I have two businesses that reached out to know sorry for mama sushi to express to talk about a situation of harassment that she's currently experiencing by by individuals and elise caballero from I open optical, who wanted to speak on certain inconsistencies that she found within the distribution of funds from hispanic federation, and she would like to understand a bit better As far.
The only reason that they were on the agenda was for the fact that they reached out and they wanted to share a certain sentiment that they were experiencing was get a temperature check from the committee and get the ball rolling so that we could have a good meeting next month because it's been a it's been a hectic summer and therefore I felt everybody was doing their thing in one way or another recovering from the pandemic and its implications.
Cindy works for td and rafael works for apple bank cindy also was working in a like a commerce organization around other small businesses What we're trying to do is just readjust assess and then just figure out what we could do in the in the time period that we have, which is I, would say till december, which, when the next election is for the community board chair, and then we just figure out what the next year's agenda is, and we were also going to honor during women's history month, which was march, we were going to honor 12 community board, 12-12 women, business owners, and so that got squashed too, like if domingo said, everything that was supposed to happen in march just couldn't happen.
So, like you know, I kind of like that flexible nature that we met the need of the community versus going in with I mean, except for the one in the off season, but versus going in with a set of set agenda for every month like meeting the need of the community It's not that it has to happen all the time, but I honestly thought that our service, when the beginning of this pandemic and when ppp loans, ppp loans started rolling out, and then you did a great job, organizing that domingo If the galaxy note 10 plus, is one of our small business guests, please by making them a panelist galaxy note, 10, plus in the downtime?
I know that the city now has a like a mediation system between businesses and community members, so we're gonna see how that went and see how we could understand both arguments and see how we could create a middle ground and a compromise to make sure everybody walks home with this That was the conversation behind her wanting to speak.
So I think that's something that we have to hold some sort of like town hall or conversation around, because I think that's gonna impact a lot of our small businesses being that we are so heavily restaurant influenced Is our committee and we'll be asking some questions after you're done?
How we clean up the street and everything I have a question unless me or you want to go first, you can go first cool, so individuals who don't live in the community, some looking for some sort of way of bringing down local businesses for whatever interest they try to uphold like regulations as What type of support city agencies are providing in order to be able to to develop that understanding e the sla I think the sla is more because of the ma, the governor, I'm sure the governor has a lot of pressure of on the sla right now, because the situation that transpired in Queens and then making sure that doesn't happen.
It's, really sad, because we know that the people who are doing this don't want to see these businesses prosper right, But, you know, that'll be something that the police should take over, because I think that it's really messed up, and then those businesses like susana susana's, soleil and many others that do adhere to restrictions and the policies set by the city.
They were saying that a shootout was reported on the restaurant and was like here no When we ask for enforcement about the mountain bikes or their bikes, they should be enforced because otherwise, this business I'm not going to survive, and I think that it comes back to the importance of licensing and business development.
We should speak about it because that's gonna be extremely important : It's life or death right A lot of these businesses are not gonna survive a winter without indoor dining or some sort of compromise that the city's willing to let science sharing codes or stern guidelines to be able to compromise and be able to figure that out, because right now the mayor's logic is that there's certain people that are not going to be that are not going to be that are not going to have access to indoor dining, but the logic has always been and I'll contact you offline, mariella, graham One, is the harassment of the business from individuals, so that example, that you know, is kicking fences and arguing with customers a it's like a police matter like that is not any kind of like regulation related piece.
That's my first question You mentioned that part of the stress of being harassed and via twitter is that they're tagging the mayor and the governor and elected officials- Then when they see people walking, then blaming on us when they see people walking on both sides of the sidewalk, the sidewalk that is across the street, that is the park, people that they just standing there hungry Now. They think that's the restaurant and everything was going on in our patio, like if any type of umbrella, anything that we put in there That's what's going on, and let me tell you if what we try, we don't we're trying to do everything the right way, so they don't get any complaint from us because we're looking forward that they close the street permanently next year.
It's just harassing from a couple of people like I say it's not a whole bunch of people is that it's a couple of people that they have good contact and they know how to how to how to how to get to those big people that want to hurt and you said, that's nothing new susanna, like it's a lot of bad, what you call urban planning, because if you go to spain, there's a lot of like different areas where you see restaurants and these type of businesses having street closures in order to be able to deal with That's another conversation next and they had the street closed completely We used to have the whole street open.
You know we had another chance, a chance in life to survive We hear you susanna and the most important role that we could play is trying to figure out how we communicate and really try to see how we could like speak to the to the speak, to the proper resources, to make sure that we work together as a community and solve a lot of these issues.
People don't know all they see, Is your business and they're going to see these fools all the business businesses, doing it right What I'm saying is this needs to be a conversation.
So I want to thank you for taking the time for coming by and in our follow up, we'll make sure to really identify who these players are and have ebenezer in the office contact them to provide a follow-up Since sanitation is not cleaning the street, you see the garbage can that they put on the street that one we are taking care of, that I take care of the one between broadway and diamond all the way down, and because we are the one who cleaning the street between broadway all the way to payson, but they already took a picture and that pinch is going to put up look mama sushi now is trying to take all the black pudding There was some questions that we will about seems like there's a lot of people worried about awnings safety on the streets, So I follow the rule and regulation of the city of new york, because it wasn't the answer because it wasn't unanimous person, We, don't put table no table all right, Now we're going to transition over to to the next item on the agenda, which is community partner, updates Has. The bid worked on anything in the summer, so we worked on distributing all the educational literature that was given out by the city to all of our merchants.
This grant It's a lot of work to contact all these businesses, one by one, oftentimes they're, not at the store If we're going to make a commitment that we want to help the community, let's be transparent, okay , what's the name of the grant?
