One of our kids got killed this summer in the Bronx I wasn't going to do anything this summer, but then just like So, I'm thankful for this short agenda because I'm tired, Now they pushing the date back.
I think it was just thinking about what was it going to look like you know, and every week passed and do you work in a school I work at in ps132 I used to work at 528 right across the street.
I mean I just saw the agenda too, so paradise phoenix and rafael fernandez, but We definitely should talk a little bit more about that when we get to our committee business part I'm, actually a little bit three camps, mariella three camps this summer during coving, 150 kids.
The only thing added to the agenda was the name of sister, Well, not for my district, so I couldn't vote for you, State committee, but it's all good And she's from open I've been hearing people complaining about that.
I have two businesses that reached out to know sorry for mama sushi to express to talk about a situation of harassment that she's currently experiencing by by individuals and elise caballero from I open optical, who wanted to speak on certain inconsistencies that she found within the distribution of funds from hispanic federation, and she would like to understand a bit better.
I think it's extremely important for us to understand what type of negotiations were done and what are the agreements that they have had like that they had with our elected officials as well as with past committees.
I know this is everything is evolving, so I just wanted to just make sure you know so that we're when we bring in people that we're hearing like a diversity of voices from the business owners in our community Just want to make sure because there's so many different business owners here of different races and ethnicities and things, and I just want to make sure that their voices are in there and represented and I just wanted to make sure that we're cognizant, and so when we're pitching people.
If you know I'm sure all of us, of course, are helping to bring some of these people in, or at least we should and when we're thinking about that.
Think about the wide diversity of the small business owners in our community, and you know and making sure that we are representing all of those voices.
And I think, like that's all responsibility, that we all have to bring upon ourselves as members of the committee once the agenda I'll personally take responsibility for the short.
But I also think it's very important that when we want to be constructive, not destructive, you know so like if you feel somebody's missing.
So I have a question: I'm, not if this is the place for it, but when I think about just collaboration within a business development, committee, I, wonder, And, I, don't know where is the place for it, but if there is already something in place or if it's possible, that this be some kind of year-long project about how we encourage collaboration amongst businesses.
That may be some that are more successful than others, especially given like the current climate, where I think, like technology uptake of some businesses, probably puts them at a greater advantage than other businesses, and I wonder where the community you know, and so it could be like across different sectors.
So I, don't know where that lives in this committee, but I just wanted to raise that Covid-19 really like changed everything we had like a dope timeline where we were gonna, do certain events for the community.
What we're trying to do is just readjust assess and then just figure out what we could do in the in the time period that we have, which is, I, would say, till december, which, when the next election is for the community board chair and then we just figure out what the next year's agenda is, and we were also going to honor during women's history.
We, were going to honor 12 community board, 12-12, women, business owners, and so that got squashed too, like if domingo said, everything that was supposed to happen in March just couldn't happen.
I know that the city now has a like a mediation system between businesses and community members.
So I think that's something that we have to hold some sort of like town hall or conversation around, because I think that's gonna impact a lot of our small businesses being that we are so heavily restaurant influenced Is our committee and we'll be asking some questions.
So individuals who don't live in the community, some looking for some sort of way of bringing down local businesses for whatever interest they try to uphold.
That is, you know, I, feel like we've been attacked and because all the people wait and if everything that happened up here is called that imam.
It's, really sad, because we know that the people who are doing this don't want to see these businesses prosper right.
But, you know, that'll, be something that the police should take over, because I think that it's really messed up, and then those businesses like susana, susana's, soleil and many others that do adhere to restrictions and the policies set by the city.
Yes, and I think that it comes back to the importance of licensing and business development working together, at least in.
What's, the future of small businesses, restaurants during Covid-19, We should speak about it because that's gonna be extremely important : It's life or death right.
A lot of these businesses are not gonna survive a winter without indoor dining or some sort of compromise that the city's willing to let science sharing codes or stern guidelines to be able to compromise and be able to figure that out, because right now the mayor's logic is that there's certain people that are not going to be that are not going to be that are not going to have access to indoor dining, but the logic has always been.
They complain about anything, that's what's going on, and let me tell you if what we try, we don't we're trying to do everything the right way, so they don't get any complaint from us because we're looking forward that they close the street permanently next year.
I like to be know very well in this community as a person that work with this community.
You know we had another chance, a chance in life to survive We hear you susanna, and the most important role that we could play is trying to figure out how we communicate and really try to see how we could like speak to the to the speak, to the proper resources, to make sure that we work together as a community and solve a lot of these issues.
That's, how they perceive living within the inner city, but I also think that we have to figure out how to work together as a community and because it's gonna be a lot of troubling months.
It's, like guilt by association, because you're just in the same vicinity and they're doing stuff outside of your business, What I, want to say is, I think, what's missing in this conversation, And I think that's going to be important element is addressing those people who are doing these things, because until we address the knuckleheads, the bad players, the people that are outside your business doing this nonsense.
Of a business fools were out there like 30 40 people were out there barbecuing.
It's outside people, and It. Very well may be- What I'm saying is we need to, as a committee also address knuckleheads and fools busy running around disturbing this community, make giving businesses like yours a bad name.
Because I got to get some sleep because I actually work: , I'm, dealing with the first department right now back and forth, because it seems like you're, pretty sure, Like I said we have to be very careful Society has already dehumanized certain individuals to the point where the people feel that their lives are not worth it.
The community board should have been involved in this committee, because I I'm sure, the mingle that you will know a lot of businesses that, because you are on the ground.
What's the new business, let's see, I was thinking that you already talked about this, but just that we discussed at open restaurants, open streets.
