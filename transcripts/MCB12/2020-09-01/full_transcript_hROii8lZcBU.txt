Hey how's, it going very good. How are you good I'm good, okay, so ebenezer? How does it work now? So you? Basically just once the meeting starts, recording, that's it you get off, I'm gonna be with you all the way to the end. Okay. So when the media start, I'm gonna, I'm gonna press recorder yeah. This meeting shouldn't be more than an hour. Okay, hello been a lot going on this summer. We didn't get a break yeah. Usually we get two months. We didn't get anything it was just I'm so exhausted. I disconnected I had. I had to oversee three camps during covet. It was in person, so oh yeah, so you have to like literally log everybody's temperature every day, just monitor that it was a. It was a cool summer. The least kids I've worked with in a while, though, because I'm used to working like seven eight hundred during the summer 150, but it felt great, like working like 2 000, with the amount of pressure. Yes, oh wow yeah. Well, that's great that they had that, though you know, I did that yeah. They didn't have that idea. Once one of our kids got killed this summer in the Bronx I shot in the neck, and I was like hell no, I was I wasn't going to do anything this summer, but then just like yeah. So I'm thankful for this short agenda because I'm tired, I'm exhausted, I am zoomed out. I am so tired, literally because I usually say like two weeks before I literally did all of that sunday and monday, because my camp finished friday, so I wasn't I saturday and then sunday and monday I got to it. Well, I saw these kids are not gonna go back to the near end of september. Now they pushing the date back ten days, and you know what's crazy, that everybody was informed today like seeing the mayor speak, that's when everybody found out see that's not right on so many levels. That's not right! You know you should be the first. They the teachers and pete educators. They and people who work with these kids should be the first to know, and I guarantee you now yeah but yeah. What can you do? I hope these people are safe because that's insane, I just don't see it when some of these buildings are really old. I worry about the ventilation. You know yeah, we're probably going to start around 705 710 to give everybody enough time, but yeah. Why did you go? Live we're not? We haven't started yet we're going to record this right, yeah, but afterwards? Okay! Oh, yes, that's right! Oh yeah! It is live now! Oh, my god! I just noticed that yeah, oh well, hi everybody. We got some board members who are in the guest side right, ebenezer yeah. We got some board members as attendees. Yes, there's some board members as attendees. If you could pass them over, please, okay, but are they a member of your committee? You have cynthia and then you have gisele. You have isidro and mariella. I don't know great. Mariella graham is, but you see those in the board. So you should just be put. Marielle is part of your committee. Yes, okay, I promote mariela yeah, hey how's, it going marielle hi. What is hey? Mariella, I'm sure you found out the news today too. I found out on twitter, that's what I'm saying I was like. I was in the squad like there was nobody talking about. Everybody was getting ready for the 11th for the time. Nobody was talking about yeah. This is how we find out our news. You know they tell us on tv that is wow well. Otherwise, how was this summer? It was okay, I mean there's just so much anxiety around reopening and all summer. I think it was just thinking about what was it going to look like you know, and every week passed and do you work in a school I work at in ps132 yeah. I worked. I used to work at 528 right across the street. Oh yeah, I worked there. I mean a long time ago, but that's where I was a teacher. Oh okay, I went to school there back in the early 2000s you did yeah huh hold on. I taught there from 2002 to 2006.. No, I was probably there like 2000.. I was there for a year 2000 to 2002, and then I went to 18.. Oh that's! When that school was only sixth grade yeah, my husband taught there- oh graham, he taught english, I probably know- maybe baby, that's so funny, but yeah I went there for a year. Look. I think it was fifth and six because I was there for like fifth and sixth grade and then it turned into six seven finney, so miss zeppy was the principal yeah miss zeppy. There was it was like a white woman. She was blonde uh-huh ellen helen, something yeah. So I mean I didn't know her. Norma perez was the principal when I was there but interesting yeah, a walsh. It was last name walsh huh, but I was only there for a year, so it was just probably like one of those interim principles all right, so we're just waiting for everybody to start coming in ebenezer pass. You got rafael, christina and isidro cause. He said I was gonna, do a presentation around partnerships, so I need them on this side. It doesn't give me any options here, but yeah. Who else is here cindy how's it going cindy long time, cindy's in san francisco, juan guzman, he's in the committee and christina is as well. Christina riches is how you pronounce it. Richie she's, richie she's, also in the waiting she's, also needs to be brought over she's here on the committee as well he's working that is, peace, hi everyone rafael's in there too he's our public member. How are you guys doing and I hear that we all want to breathe yeah, so I try to keep the agenda brief. Being that is our first meeting back yeah and understanding that it's been a hectic summer. I know there's an individual that wants to present on a situation that happened with hispanic federation around some concerns with the distribution of money, how the money was contributed. We have susana who's, wanted to speak on being harassed and and then you said you had that you had invited this. The up the sisters, uptown bookstore owner. No, I didn't invite them. I didn't invite them. I said for the next meeting that I suggested that they be that we include or not added to the agenda. We can have a conversation around that because I think yeah no, I didn't. I didn't invite them, because I didn't yeah. I didn't want to mess with this, but yeah for the next meeting yeah. I definitely would like to see okay, but it's yeah remember. It's always important. All of us are board members. All of us have responsibilities of when we feel that the agenda or anything needs a little bit more representation. I think, is upon. We have to take it upon ourselves to be able to provide that sort of recommendations and yeah. I did I just I mean I just saw the agenda too, so paradise phoenix and rafael fernandez, but yeah. We definitely should talk a little bit more about that when we get to our committee business part yeah, I'm actually a little bit three camps, mariella three camps this summer during coving, 150 kids. Already, though I felt like a thousand, but it was only 130., that's good! I'm glad they got to try something different after the spring. You know yeah. I had to take them to new jersey and I put in like certain protocols in place as far as like tracking their temperature, we provided with them with masks and etc. Do we have an updated agenda because the gen I have is just the one that I got on monday? Did we get a new one, I'm looking at the one that has small business owner susanna and somebody named ellie set and then committee business collaborations and then two community partners? It's the same thing. The only thing added to the agenda was the name of sister, oh no, that was for. I think you yeah. It was a misunder miscommunication yeah. That's for suggestions for the next meeting, and I also was thinking about tara, who has the hilltop ale house. Please hey, nobles, congratulations! Homie nobles is officially our statesman. Well, not for my district, so I couldn't vote for you yeah. That's right! That's right! State committee, but it's all good and we have some new members. We got juan paradise, christina mariella cindy, sometimes rafael's not easy. What's the name of the of the person, so her name is, he said and she's from open and I, which is on broadway between 184th and 23rd, it's an optic place. I sent her a note with the link, so I hope that she's going to join us out. Okay, cool so we'll start at 7, 10., yeah, well, you're, going on and off. Did you hear me your internet's a bit laggy? Okay? Can you hear me better now, so I sent her a note. Her name is elise caballero and she wanted to bring some issues concerning the hispanic federation yeah. So I sent a link, I hope, she's going to join us pretty soon. Okay, yeah I've been hearing people complaining about that. Also we have chris nichols from senator jackson's office. Ebenezer. If you could please switch him over. Do you want to promote whom chris nicholl senator jackson's office? Looking sharp, like always hey, how's it going committee? How are you guys? We have two four five individuals there from cynthia harper, all right so on the agenda today we have so as far as the report there wasn't much this summer. Are we recording domingo? Let me know when you're gonna start the meeting, so I can't start recording okay, it says, like you, are already recording like it's already. No, I'm not recording I'm not recording yet okay. So, let's start the meeting. Yes, we are recording now all right, perfect. So on the agenda today. I try to keep it brief, since we are in uncertain times- and we know that- there's a lot going on so I try to keep it as brief as possible, but we're still at before. We approve the agenda. If anybody would like to add anything, you could do it after the my opening remarks, so I hope everybody received the agenda thus far. We have my opening remarks. Approval of agenda small business testimonies, I'm gonna, be removing tara only from sister's bookstore. It was a miscommunication between me and tanya. She wants to bring her in next month. I have two businesses that reached out to know sorry for mama sushi to express to talk about a situation of harassment that she's currently experiencing by by individuals and elise caballero from I open optical, who wanted to speak on certain inconsistencies that she found within the distribution of funds from hispanic federation, and she would like to understand a bit better. As far as committee business, we have collaborations community partner updates and the final item in the agenda is old business, any new business announcements and adjournment. As far as my welcoming remarks, it's been a hectic summer. As you all know, our committee did a lot last year when the pandemic first broke out that the city shut down. We did a lot of resource driven events for small businesses. We tried to do as much as we could with with uncertain times, and we did our best. Everything went well, but unfortunately, it took the summer was somewhat a bit complicated for me. That's why I personally did quality summer sessions with the camps and the pandemic and job responsibilities. I did, though, get invited this summer to a meeting around the tower hotel that hotel room that's being built in 181st in amsterdam and amsterdam. I think it's pretty. It's really important for us to understand cbas as you have these huge developments coming into our communities. I think it's extremely important for us to understand what type of negotiations were done and what are the agreements that they have had like that they had with our elected officials as well as with past committees. In the past, we have to understand what these cbas are, so just giving everybody a heads up. I would like and ebeneze I'll be contacting you for that. I want to get the cba that the tower did with land use and have a full understanding of what were some of the promises that they made to our community. But besides that, that's my report. If anybody has any questions around that, please let me know now before we move forward tanya, will you be doing the minutes? I am yes, thank you. So if there's any questions, that was that's my report, do you need a merchant to adopt an agenda or are you I think tommy wanted to add something to the agenda? If I'm not mistaken, no, I didn't want to add I wanted to in the when we get to the committee business. I just wanted to talk about some of the small businesses that we're bringing in, and you know just kind of looking at that a little bit and that's what that was for. When we get to committee business, I'm not sure under committee business we have collaborations. Would you do you feel like that would fall into that yeah? I think so because we are that's yeah, we're partners with them with the businesses and collaborators. So I guess that could fit okay cool. So the only modification before we adopt the agenda is to remove the third speaker, which is the owner of sister of sisters, uptown yeah. You have the name wrong: tara is l, house and but sisters, I yeah so but yeah. The idea is we'll talk about that later, but yeah. So thank you for removing that. Thank you. Okay, perfect. Could I get a motion to approve the agenda? You know what's cool here. Let me see if you could do it, do we have to speak on it or could we? Oh? No, you can't do the thumbs up here. I was about to be thumbs up thumbs down. Is there anybody that any oppositions to the modification made to the agenda no thumbs up? We good great okay, so all right, perfect, all right so is there. Anybody is give me one. Second, all right so is susana, osorio or elizabeth in here you could use the chat to. Let us know if you're not we'll be moving on to committee, business or ones twice all right, so committee business tanya, let's talk about what you're feeling yeah, so you know just you know. I know this is everything is evolving, so I just wanted to just make sure you know so that we're when we bring in people that we're hearing like a diversity of voices from the business owners in our community just want to make sure because there's so many different business owners here of different races and ethnicities and things, and I just want to make sure that their voices are in there and represented and when they you know to bring them in and hear from them as well. You know I want to make sure it's just not. You know. You know one group that we're hearing from good, because I know that I've spoken to a number of these businesses, including tara. I was talking about different issues that she's been experienced down there, where she's at one five, seven and so yeah I mean there are so many. I just wanted to make sure that we're cognizant, and so when we're pitching people, if you know I'm sure all of us, of course, are helping to bring some of these people in, or at least we should and when we're thinking about that. Think about the wide diversity of the small business owners in our community, and you know and making sure that we are representing all of those voices yeah. I hear you tony and I think, like that's all responsibility, that we all have to bring upon ourselves as members of the committee once the agenda I'll personally take responsibility for the short, the limited time that I sent out the agenda. I had work responsibilities that really limited me from being able to send it sent out an agenda. I usually send it out two weeks prior at least a week prior to the meeting, but I think it's we are responsible for contributing in one way or another to diversity. That's something that we all have to be cognizant of that we all have to uphold, but I also think it's very important that when we want to be constructive, not destructive, you know so like if you feel somebody's missing. It's not solely just the issue on diversity, but I also think it's important to note that it might be that these were the only individuals who reached out. You know the only reason that they were on the agenda was for the fact that they reached out and they wanted to share a certain sentiment that they were experiencing. So that's why I would all I wanted to do honestly in this meeting was get a temperature check from the committee and get the ball rolling so that we could have a good meeting next month because it's been a it's been a hectic summer and therefore I felt everybody was doing their thing in one way or another recovering from the pandemic and its implications. You know, so I just felt that I didn't want to bombard everybody with information the first meeting, so that's why I only added those two individuals and yeah. So if anybody else wants to add anything feel free to yeah and that's definitely appreciated domingo like I was, I was definitely fretting a 10 11 pm meeting tonight. So I appreciate keeping the agenda light and to your point, like even I didn't really know like what the procedure was to getting business this year, but I always thought that it was if they wanted to reach out to us. But you know, tanya brings up something interesting, and you certainly took on some responsibility here to like. If we don't get a good representation, at least from the folks that want to come and present to us or what have you then we could maybe do some outreach. So I'm 100 behind that, and I will certainly help you out with that agreed. So I have a question: I'm not if this is the place for it, but when I think about just collaboration within a business development committee, I wonder- and I don't know where is the place for it, but if there is already something in place or if it's possible, that this be some kind of year-long project about how we encourage collaboration amongst businesses. That may be some that are more successful than others, especially given like the current climate, where I think, like technology uptake of some businesses, probably puts them at a greater advantage than other businesses, and I wonder where the community you know, and so it could be like across different sectors right. So I don't think like one restaurant wants to help like necessarily right, like the competition right. Next door, but other like cross kind of cross-interest businesses- and I wonder if that's just I don't know where the place for that is. I mean part of my interest in the business development committee- was thinking about collaboration and sharing expertise. So I don't know where that lives in this committee, but I just wanted to raise that yeah so covet really like changed everything we had like a dope timeline where we were gonna do certain events for the community. As far as you know, working for the DOE, sometimes where we have access to certain, I even forgot the wording that we were using tania. Do you remember what fair we were going to put together towards the spring? You remember a procurement. We were going to put a procurement right and then guess what hit the following day. It wasn't. Even it wasn't. Even it was february and by the next meeting everything shut down. Nobody knows how what's happening, we're having meetings just providing businesses with information, whether it be legal around lease etc. But we were planning to have summer. Youth do a canvassing event, so we could start developing a database and we could start up putting together isidro who's. The director of the bid also has connections with where he comes to participate. In some of the we have a partnership section where we encourage local organizations that are working with small businesses to be able to report on what type of events they have, what type etc. So we won't have to replicate the wheel sit. You have cindy and rafael who are both working in banks. Cindy works for td and rafael works for apple bank cindy also was working in a like a commerce organization around other small businesses. So I feel, like everything was coming together and then kobe just put a halt on everything. So right now, what we're trying to do is just readjust assess and then just figure out what we could do in the in the time period that we have, which is, I would say, till december, which, when the next election is for the community board chair and then we just figure out what the next year's agenda is, and we were also going to honor during women's history month, which was march, we were going to honor 12 community board, 12-12 women, business owners, and so that got squashed too, like if domingo said, everything that was supposed to happen in march just couldn't happen so yeah there was a lot in the works before the pandemic hit. You know, I was really excited about honoring the women business owners. I was just like ready. We had the invitations done created, all of it we're ready to go it's so disappointing, but hopefully we can revisit that. I don't know you know. I think we could definitely revisit that, but back to mariela's point. I think it's just. This is the right space for that what we have to identify is like. How does that look, and what do we envision and just move forward on it, because, unfortunately, right now, everything is so different that yeah we're just trying to figure out how we could develop these inter-interest collaborations during covet anything else. I would say to our credit, though we had two very successful kind of like more timely, not meetings, but information sessions during one was during our one was during our actual session, but one was during the off session right, yeah, correct yeah. So, like you know, I kind of like that flexible nature that we met the need of the community versus going in with I mean, except for the one in the off season, but versus going in with a set of set agenda for every month like meeting the need of the community. I hadn't seen that in some of the other board meetings, I've been a part of where it's more predetermined in terms of what we're going to be talking about. So it's not that it has to happen all the time, but I honestly thought that our service, when the beginning of this pandemic and when ppp loans, ppp loans started rolling out, I think that our role was very beneficial in that and then you did a great job, organizing that domingo and also yep yeah. It was so difficult because we had so much plans, but it was like. Oh, we were gonna do all of these. We had these google docs set up, but it was just. I really think we didn't know how bad covert was gonna, be you know right exactly well, that's what really we went in there with all good intentions, but it was. It was pretty different ebenezer. Can you check if the galaxy note 10 plus, is one of our small business guests, please by making them a panelist galaxy note, 10 plus in the downtime? I actually have a question and it's idro. You might actually know the answer to this better than that. Okay, I promoted the panelist okay because they don't have a name. So I was just wondering if this is one of our guests. Okay, I promoted to panelists is: can you immute yourself galaxy note 10 plus they might not even know their galaxy note, 10, plus domingo. I also want you to be aware that somebody put in the q a her name is gisele as kona lubach and she said she wanted to introduce herself as a resource to small business owners. So I just want you to be aware that person will do that during announcements. Okay, what's your name giselle! So we'll make sure you do your introduction during announcements. All right! Oh yeah, that's susana, hey susanna! How's it going. Can you unmute yourself? Please can you hear us because we can't hear you, I guess you'll come back, no say hello, patra, all right, so yeah! So that's susano sorio! She owns several businesses in the community. She owns mama sushi and which is the other one cindy. Something like that. It's like a hibachi spot. So she's like she has a few businesses on the dykma strip. So she basically reached out I'll give everybody some pretext as to how the conversation went because there had been some. I believe some individuals who've been harassing her and her business, so I invited her to speak on it. I know that the city now has a like a mediation system between businesses and community members, so we're gonna see how that went and see how we could understand both arguments and see how we could create a middle ground and a compromise to make sure everybody walks home with this. So that was the conversation behind her wanting to speak. Jonathan come on two times all right, so we're just waiting for her, but back to it so mariela, oh she's, back so mariela back like well, we'll figure it out it's just. We gotta figure out how it's gonna work now, because it's very interesting, but we do have about 200 businesses that provided their email in our in our events during the pica Covid-19 who we could reach out to in the future months. I think a lot of the concerns that they were expressing to me was around there not being a plan for indoor dining during the winter. So I think that's something that we have to hold some sort of like town hall or conversation around, because I think that's gonna impact a lot of our small businesses being that we are so heavily restaurant influenced okay domingo. I promoted again the cell phone before she should be available to talk to china. Yes, can you hear me now yeah we hear you so susanna. You have 10 minutes, just explain to us. What's going on this? Is our committee and we'll be asking some questions after you're done? Okay, so we we've been going through a lot right now we all the harassment that we have from everyone, I'm not going to tell you only from the department of liquor authority, because I know that they, you know they doing what they asked to be to you know to do, but we're following all the instructions got that in diamond garden. That is a diamond and broadway all the way down to diamond in semen, oh wow, because mama wanna sea walking, none of us we've been behaving. We've been closing on time. We've been filing root and regulation, the other harassment that we have. That is the most serious that I think is a couple of people that they're not part of this community. They just want to be part of this community, raising the boys and complaining about us posting social media. He doing yeah like promoting that we're doing you know we're trying to survive in here. It's very hard. Look at myself, I'm over I'm overwhelmed. You know it's like. I have to be here every day at nine o'clock, making sure that we clean we clean the street following from broadway ending in impaising. We have to go and collect the garbage daily, so making sure that everything is clean around this area. So we can. We can make other people happy to make other people happy in the community and they stopped complaining about us, but that's not enough for them. They continue complaining and tagging all the other offers. May your call more de Blasio, you know they really got us, I'm very nervous about what's going on and at the same time you know the weather is not helping and when they see that all of us we put, we put up that can to cover from the rain that is secure. They attack other office, they need your department, so I don't know what they're looking for. They need to stop harassing us we're going through a lot emotionally in here and at the same time we don't know. What's going to happen, I don't know who's going to help us to open. You know they open every way around what I live in yonkers and it's crazy that in here we've been treating like delinquents. You know. I know that a lot of people that don't they haven't followed all the rude and regulation, but us the one. We follow the rule of regulation. He is sitting every night. He gets a video from me from this community. It's showing him the time that we close and how we leave the street in the night, how we clean up the street and everything and it's they're still not happy they still harassing. So I don't know how we're gonna survive. Honestly, I'm scared. Okay, do you want to ask me any question anybody? I have a question unless me or you want to go first, you can go first cool. So what I'll do is I'll? Ask I'll ask I'll just try to like sum it up, so we could have an understanding of what she said and then I have tanya so use that race hand feature if you can on the on the zoom and that's gonna, make it easier. Let me see cindy, you think you can help me with that like whenever you see a hand, just let me know who goes next all right, so I right now I got tanya isidro and then that's it. Okay, so susanna. I got three things so individuals who don't live in the community, some looking for some sort of way of bringing down local businesses for whatever interest they try to uphold like regulations and like it being very unclear or vague as to like what are the protocols, what type of support city agencies are providing in order to be able to to develop that understanding e the sla. I think the sla is more because of the ma, the governor, I'm sure the governor has a lot of pressure of on the sla right now, because the situation that transpired in Queens and then making sure that doesn't happen. That's from what I've been able to gather there's a lot of pressure on the sla, so I'm sure that they're walking a very thin line right now and just being like the uncertainty of. What's going to happen so now before I ask my questions: I'm gonna call antonio isidro and mariela in that order, so okay, susanna hi. First of all, I want to say I love the food. I order from your restaurant, that's below six, one, six, five yeah! So yeah it's been a mainstay of mine during the shutdown, but I wanted to ask you. I wonder: who are you saying is harassing you have you identified who people are and what is the nature of their complaints? What are they saying so? Who are these people and what are what are they? What are they? What are they saying you're doing? Okay, so let me tell you it's it's twitter page. I've never had a twitter page. I open one. You know to trying to get a communication to that person and I have victor my nephew. His name is victor santo, he's the manager in mama juana, and it's a twitter page, the name of the twitter page is it will keeping them for real. So you know what they even attacked. Mario Cuomo, one day I was not working. I was standing with my son like that, and they took a picture of myself. They took it's a person that doesn't have a life and I try to communicate with a person because they keep taking picture of everything. What's going on like, for example, when I did a red thing to cover from the rain she posted that she, oh he I don't know who it is because we send them, we send them an a dm what they call in twitter asking that person. If we can sit down to discuss what is what they bothered. You know what we can do to work together and that person is not interesting. It's a person that is it's a it's a page that it is acting and then that page tag a couple of tv reporter and they and they replied to them, and they using the video to post that you know the video that she made of us to post it on tv, and I said, but this doesn't help us if you come to diamond. If you come to diamond, you can come with that thing that you can merge the social distancing and you're going to see each restaurant mama, juana, isole, papacito, diamond bar and part you. We all have the social destiny, because, even if it's not my restaurant are responsible for this program that they open in the street, and when I, when I put my name in something, everyone have to respect and everybody is being followed, the rule, that's what liquor has already come here, three or four times a day, and they have never since the 22 of june. They have given us any warning or any ticket, because everybody is wearing the mask on the all. The employees are following the rule and regulation and our customers have to respect us when they come in because right now, if you don't know how to run your place, they take away your legal license. You understand in that page they come. They can come anytime and they're. Looking for any little things to post it in social media, that's harassing because they attacked major Cuomo, they attacked de Blasio, they attacked d.o.t. They attacked all the department that you can imagine. Okay, I have what I want to say. One thing I want to ask you, so I want a little bit more about what they're saying you're doing, but I also wanted to say if you feel that you are paying for what some other people on indictment are doing. Are you sort of paying the price? Yes for my association, I you know what I mean. You know my feeling. Listen, israel is my weakness. Is this in this group and he knows that I send them a video every day, I've. I only took three day off last week because I had a breakdown. I had a breakdown. You know with that page. That is, you know, I feel like we've been attacked and because all the people wait and if everything that happened up here is called that imam. It happened in 207 that black party that they have overnight into the morning they put diamond and they attack all the mayor's office, anything that happened in 10th avenue they put dykema anything that happened anywhere in uptown and inward. They say diamond and that's a problem diamond like one of the inspectors from the liquor authority. He told me very clear: you know what happened that diamond is like I'm not going to tell you the work that he told me. We have back reputation, but are you guys doing good, which I agree and listen, and I respect- and I respect all those inspectors when they come around they're doing a job, because other people are not doing what they're supposed to be doing? Okay, but you know what we get nervous all right, so so thank you, domingo and your committee member staff for allowing me to be part of this meeting. I'm very grateful for the work that all these services restaurateurs have done for the community. As you know, domingo- and you know the members, but these restaurants- they work really hard to make their dreams come true, and it is it's really ugly to know that the way that enforcement has been done has not been proportionate. So you know, as far as like the harassment that susana is going through. I've seen that I've seen videos and to respond to your question tanya. There is a video where some people male go around dickman, particularly what susana is kicking. The fences and actually arguing with a clientele- and that is the sole purpose you know- to make sure that clientele doesn't attend these businesses anymore. So there is a video, I think, susanna we have the video at hand. It's really sad, because we know that the people who are doing this don't want to see these businesses prosper right and we cannot know who they are. But you know that'll be something that the police should take over, because I think that it's really messed up and then those businesses like susana, susana's, soleil and many others that do adhere to restrictions and the policies set by the city. Those are the businesses that get fully attacked. I have witnessed many business on dikeman, which are not part of that area where susana is where they will open up at three o'clock in the morning, and I question why they never have the licenses suspended. We know that sla is taking the licenses away. We know for businesses in inwood that the license have been taken away and that's because most of them were doing really serious violations. Is it fair? Maybe not, but there were some businesses that were doing even worse and the question is: why isn't like a proportionate and equal enforcement of the law taking place? That is the question right. So I I've been too many places where businesses can get tagged by the noise level. The means, I'm sure you know about the mountain bikes that now they make explosion. So I was sitting at a restaurant and about five individuals came by and they were just blowing that up. It's a that's, a that's a dirtbag, the third bike right and then like three or four minutes later the NYPD comes by like, and they were saying that a shootout was reported on the restaurant and was like here no and then other places. We get the same problem and then those those noise provoked by the dirt bikes are typed in to the restaurants and the bars and whenever they call 311 they're calling up other restaurants. So it's something that we have to be cognizant about some of the problems that these businesses are facing. Not all of them are innocent, but I can tell you that susana lies along with mama tsushima mahuana they're complying and they're not going to get many summonses because they follow. The regulations bless you of the last la. But again, when we ask for enforcement about the mountain bikes or their bikes, they should be enforced yeah because otherwise, this business I'm not going to survive. Yes, and I think that it comes back to the importance of licensing and business development working together, at least in. I think something, that's mutually something that I would say is both within our interest is one understanding the three one debacle you know the weaponization of 3-1-1, but also being able to speak on how there's certain there's a lack of guidance is provided to small businesses, lack of support from city agencies to be able to bridge that connect of understanding what compliance is and is it? You know- and I think that's certain areas that we could work on, but I think one of the areas that we definitely have to work on is developing a town hall around. What's the future of small businesses, restaurants during Covid-19, and I think we should plan that together, we should speak about it because that's gonna be extremely important and that's gonna. It's life or death right. A lot of these businesses are not gonna survive a winter without indoor dining or some sort of compromise that the city's willing to let science sharing codes or stern guidelines to be able to compromise and be able to figure that out, because right now the mayor's logic is that there's certain people that are not going to be that are not going to be that are not going to have access to indoor dining, but the logic has always been. I always wanted to stay at the taj mahal. It doesn't mean I could afford it right. So it's like there's a real disconnect there that I think we have to advocate for it together so and I'll contact you offline, mariella, graham, is next followed by crawford and then christine. If I'm not mistaken, cindy it's cynthia christina, then tony okay go ahead yeah. So it sounds from what I've heard that there are like two parts to this. One is the harassment of the business from individuals, so that example, that you know, is kicking fences and arguing with customers. So that seems like one piece that I agree with this either. It's like a it's like a police matter like that is not any kind of like regulation related piece, but my I had a question about, and someone had written this also in the in the chat. I still don't understand exactly what the grievances have been like. What is it so I mean I could go on twitter and try to find what exactly they're saying about these businesses and what have the repercussions been besides. These visits by the sla which I can understand are very stressful, but you mentioned that there was like you know: they're tagging, the governor they're tagging, the mayor and all of these electeds, and I wonder, is that the repercussion, just the tagging, that is, that is the concern susanna. I think she froze susan. Are you there? I think her internet froze she's like frozen but yeah. So as she gets back with the connection yeah, it seems like there's two layers. One is around like the policing aspect and the other one is the city and governmental agencies. Susanna noye, you hear us, can you hear me now yeah, so did you get to hear what mariella asked? No it wasn't you for one. Second, I don't know yeah tell me about it. Tell me that I'm learning so my question. My question was: I have two questions. One is, I still don't understand: what are the exact complaints that these people are making? So that's my first question. The second one is: have there been repercussions you mentioned that part of the stress of being harassed and via twitter is that they're tagging the mayor and the governor and elected officials- and I'm wondering has anything happened as a result of that tagging on twitter mariella. Thank you for asking. You see that we send the video every night we close by not later that then 10 50, 10 45, and everything will happen after that time. All the motorcycle, all the noise that they're going around they start taking pictures and sending to them, but the way that they take the picture is kind of tricky it. Can. It can show that it's coming from around here they go on top of the gas station, but we are closed and the other and the other thing that they harassing is on the weekend. Then, when they see people walking, then blaming on us when they see people walking on both sides of the sidewalk, the sidewalk that is across the street, that is the park, people that they just standing there hungry. Now they think that's the restaurant and everything was going on in our patio, like if any type of umbrella, anything that we put in there. They attacked me the city, so they can come into inspection. It's so many. It's so many things that I that I would love to forward to you guys. So you could see what's going on? Okay, it's not only one. They complain about anything, that's what's going on and let me tell you if what we try, we don't we're trying to do everything the right way, so they don't get any complaint from us because we're looking forward that they close the street permanently next year. We behave like a good little kid doing the job, so they can see that we now we're not getting tickets, we're not getting any violation of anything because we're doing our job in our side. Yeah. Do you understand? So it's just harassing from a couple of people like I say it's not a whole bunch of people is that it's a couple of people that they have good contact and they know how to how to how to how to get to those big people that want to hurt us. I can't hear you yeah, I understand- and you said that's nothing new susanna, like it's a lot of bad, what you call urban planning, because if you go to spain, there's a lot of like different areas where you see restaurants and these type of businesses having street closures in order to be able to deal with. But that's another conversation next we have, can you say something else? I just went to a couple of places all the way downtown and they had the street closed completely, and you know what they did. They put so much pressure on us. We used to have the whole street open, you know putting you know, so we can have all our employees back to work right now. We only have to open the street friday, saturday and sunday, because, basically that's what they are proving the city. So the steals are still a closed street, but we don't put the table and you know what it was doing. The motorcycle and everyone that you can imagine that was coming over hanging out in there and doing so many things that it was not fair for us that we spent so much money trying to make people feel comfortable when they're coming to eat on the street. We put plants flower, we invest so much money that we didn't have. We was asking people hey. Can you help us with this with that and still not making people happy? They just don't want to see us in here and I'm sorry. I am proud of the economy of this country and closing us down is not going to help us, like you say, taking on delivery is not going to it's not going gonna. Keep us open, what's gonna happen. What's gonna happen with all my employees, what's gonna happen to them yeah, so next we have who we have next to me. I think it's nobles and then christina. Yes, then cynthia, then christina, okay, cool, yes, cool! Go ahead, thanks a lot yeah! Thank you thanks a lot for telling us your story, suzanna. I really appreciate it and you know it takes a lot of courage to come and just lay it all on the line. So I totally get that so mine's kind of a question and also a little bit of advice. I'll do the advice first, so I work extensively in digital media, especially social media. I run the marketing for lysol and airwick and stuff like that, and I can tell you that I that people might tag you in those tweets harassing you, which is definitely harassment in the way that you've described it, but I can almost guarantee you that if they're going above our local electeds like adonis or mark those folks are probably not going to be paying attention to your tweet, so take a little bit of solace there. Unless, like the account that I was tweeting, you has a very high follower count. That would be different, but it sounds like it does not take a little bit of solace. Did you know it will keep it in for real? Why don't you follow them and trying to be a mediator? I'll, take a look here, but also to you. Another piece of advice is, and it sounds like you're doing it, but correct me if I'm wrong, that your you're responding to those tweets with pictures of or video of you doing things right and by the book. Is that correct? Yes, we have a, we have a twitter. Now we have a, we have an instagram, it's called a diamond garden and all the good things and how we do it around here. Okay, I think, as long as you're, responding to those harassing tweets with the with the video or the pictures, countering their narrative you'll definitely be okay. I wouldn't worry too much about it, and then this is actually. It leads to a question and isidro. I was asking earlier. This actually might be a better question for you to answer. Instead of me, because you see the overall picture in the neighborhood, has there been like an instance of targeting citations or tickets for restaurants by you know by different new york organizations or entities of our local government? Have you seen that in our neighborhood so novel, the NYPD has not been really active? Enforcing the regulations are imposed by the city in the state. I will give them credit for giving those you know those clients and the merchants some type of break, if you may study that, of course, but when it comes to sla, which is a state run agency, there are a lot of issues there. I've seen videos with state inspectors themselves, half coming into businesses without wearing a mask or face covering, and they are the ones penalizing the businesses with a huge amount of money in summonses, every violation is ten thousand dollars and if they have like three employees that are not wearing face, mask that'll, be thirty thousand dollars, and when I saw the video of this state inspector who, by the way, doesn't have to be sla trained, I don't if you're aware, but the governor has called in different inspectors from different areas. And then I fully train on the regulations set by the sla, thus bringing a lot of problems, because how can you enforce regulations that you yourself are violating right? The case with the video? It was clearly shown that an inspector came into a premise without wearing a mask, so that was troublesome troubling, and I hope that you know these things will change, but it's mostly the state that is enforcing the regulations, and you know based on what I've seen some of them do violate some restrictions. But how can you impose anywhere from ten thousand to thirty thousand dollars summonses to business that are just coming out of pandemic? I mean that's: is it random? Is it random, where they walk like I'm, assuming they go on patrol they try to find. You know, infractions and stuff like that, or is it targeted like? Do they go to specific places? Do you know their process and that they base based on what I understand from the sla they go by way of complaints that they receive? Okay and again, that could be a representation of the 311, but it can also be that you know based on previous issues. They are targeting those places but other in that they saying that it's all about random inspections, okay, so susanna. I think that you're handling this the correct way. I think that you're doing a good job if you're posting pictures of your closing and things like that, just to put on the record that you're doing things by the book, because I'm assuming you can probably appeal if you were to be, if you were to be ticketed or something I think you could appeal that and if you have the proof that you're doing this by the book, I don't think that it'll be. I don't think it'd be too much of a challenge but keep it up this sucks and I totally feel for you, but I think you're doing the right stuff. That's all thanks, domingo! All right! Thank you! So the next, let's focus the board mem. The next board member is christina right, cindy christine, I believe, and then remember yeah. So we have a attendee that would like to speak yeah, but usually the board members speak first and then we'll let you know we have christina than tanya all right, christina go ahead, hi susana! How are you firstly? Can she hear me? It looks like she's frozen. Yes, I'm right here, okay! Firstly, I just want to thank you for sharing that you know it sounds very unfortunate. I personally have celebrated some of the most beautiful things. Might my engagement at your place and I have nothing but wonderful things to say about your place and you included, as the manager have walked up to me and you've just been so kind and warm so I'm so sorry, you're going through this, I feel like. I almost feel like the emotion that you're sharing here and I can see the stress and yeah. I just want to firstly say sorry about that, but I do have some questions. Okay, so my questions to you are besides this twitter page right and I understand like there's various, perhaps various like social media accounts that are sort of doing this. Is there any anybody else or anything else happening besides the social media platforms that are harassing you guys? Yes, so thank you for asking. This is a good! You know. If you ask me a question I'll be able to answer, because at my head, it's like this right now, so you know when we was going back in april, when we had a problem that we had to put a cover, our glass with, with all this wood and all the kids from the neighborhood and the local artist. They came in and paint they took the time and they did such a beautiful art. And we, when we removed from our front, we didn't want to throw them out. Everything started there when I asked a park, if I can put all those memorial right in front of our establishment, but across the street in the park that lady from the park she was hysterical, she sent me an email. She was saying that we're not allowed to put that in there I say, but how come I'm gonna, throw away all this value art that all these young kids from this neighborhood? They spend the time they during the pandemic, when they, when you know it was it, was that problem black lives matter that we have to cover everything. You know they came and draw all this picture. They ca. I mean all these arts all this they painted, and I don't want it to at all. They are so beautiful, and I think this is part of this community and the park doesn't have a name and an honor, and we want to put them in there. Also memorial and everything start in there that they was attacking me, because everyone knows that it was me the one who was working with them, putting everything together- and I don't everybody knows that lady from the park, everyone know her everyone. I don't even have to mention her name in here, and everything is starting there, that she doesn't want those memorial in there and that's when they create that page inward keeping them for real and twitter, and that page only attack us in here. Everything from the corner see what on the corner of they even put in the a lot of paper. They make a lot of copies and they put it everywhere if somebody gonna get killed, blame susanna from mama sushi and isolate that day. When I wake up that, my neighbor from here told me what's going on, they put in a lot of people everywhere. If somebody get killed crossing the street to blame me any so, let's I and I showed that to what mr adriano espana tuidanes. I got all those people it was they made copies and they put it everywhere around the park around the barrel. Those NYPD borrowed that they put everywhere. I say what are they wanting to say? I start crying because that's harassing you know I like to be know very well in this community as a person that work with this community. Now that I'm against on my community, I grew up in here, and you know what they doing. They do a lot of meeting in that park in semen indictment they all get together in there and you know what they were saying. They should have resumed this area and take out all this restaurant. What's going on, you know we had another chance, a chance in life to survive and they they're attacking us like this, I'm about to lose yeah. So we hear you susanna and the most important role that we could play is trying to figure out how we communicate and really try to see how we could like speak to the to the speak, to the proper resources, to make sure that we work together as a community and solve a lot of these issues next yeah three weeks ago, because someone, you know they really care and they send me all those videos. What are you talking about quality life we close at 11 p.m, whatever happened after 11 p.m. It's not our fault, that's NYPD, and I'm not going to risk my life. You know to save the blood fields. You know because he's not sending it to the police. I want to be involved when I close my door at 11 pm. I leave this place because we're not even supposed to be wrong in case that they come. I don't want it to misunderstand that I'm still open, so everything will happen. Then they're talking about quality life. What do you mean by quality like because I live, and it's not our fault? What's going on after that areas that I see that you're already working with they see that one of the areas we could support it- and I feel like it's important to engage social media- is always going to be social media. You know so at the end of the day. I might not know you personally, but I know that you've done a lot of great work in the community. You collaborate on a lot of different levels, there's individuals that have an understanding that living in the cities like living in the suburbs and that's how that's how they fought, that's, how they perceive living within the inner city, but I also think that we have to figure out how to work together as a community and because it's gonna be a lot of troubling months coming ahead. You know the mayor right now is talking about no outdoor dining. You know, and I think, like those are areas we could collaborate as far as some of the complaints that are going on, I think you're already doing a great job. You made that little corridor right there, beautiful with all the paintings and everything that that's happening now. Everybody in the city is copying that you know so it speaks to a lot but like what I would say is I learned this at a very young age, but haters are gonna, always hate, there's nothing. You can really do about it, but as long as you are conducting yourself properly and you're understanding that your business does impact your immediate surroundings and you're able to put systems in place that that's able to make sure that you you're covered, I don't think you have much to worry about you're, one of the most commendable businesses owners of town. You know so that alone should at least give you a peace of mind. While you have all these businesses closing down, you got people copying what you're doing in your vicinity, and you know so. I think that's something that's important to know the questions. There are some questions here. Speaking about a fire skate a demigo. I actually I actually had another. I hear you I hear you, but I haven't asked the question yet so I'm just gonna ask these questions and then I got you andy because both of you have your hands up. So you're gonna finish with me, so I can tell you something else to end this conversation with me. I have. I have something I need to ask her. You know it's. Okay, there's! You have asked several questions already. I'm gonna ask the q a questions and then I'm gonna go back to all right and domingo. We have an attendee that has their hand raised as well. Okay, so let's let the attendee talk. I asked the q and a questions and then I'll allow repeat questions. Well, I thought I thought that we were doing board members first. You asked the question already tommy I, but my question was very strange and I didn't get to do. A lot of follow-up people did speak longer than I did. Mine was very quick and very cut off, so I do have follow-up and I think that board members should be able to ask these questions and, while she's here, I want to get some clarity. So that's what I'm saying he is here: we're going to follow that cynthia said since I'm next, actually, I'm actually next yeah, no you're, not cynthia. I am put ebenezer put cynthia to speak cynthia aubrey she's on the attendees she's, not a board member everybody. I actually take offense to that because, if we're going to say that we're going to let board members ask their questions, then we should do that. Thank you. I yield my time to tanya. Thank you cynthia. All right. I would like to ask you a question susannah sure, because one of the points ebenezer send cynthia back to the attendees. Please: okay, susannah one of the things. This is absolutely horrible and one of the things that I cannot stand is for somebody who is doing what they're supposed to do to be harmed by other knuckleheads doing what they're not supposed to be doing right. It's like guilt by association because you're just in the same vicinity and they're doing stuff outside of your business, that's unacceptable. What I want to say is, I think, what's missing in this conversation is- and I think that's going to be important element is addressing those people who are doing these things, because until we address the knuckleheads, the bad players, the people that are outside your business doing this nonsense and that's gonna have to be a part of it. If someone people gonna, just associate you with stuff knuckleheads, are doing outside of your business after you're closed. I can tell you an example where I am outside. Of a business fools were out there like 30 40 people were out there barbecuing, they had a freaking grill at three o'clock in the morning barbecuing and having a party triple park outside of these businesses. Well, the businesses were not happy about that. They said this is being associated with us. We're not this. So I think instead of just saying. Oh, it's the three one ones, and it's just this and it's outside people, and it very well may be- I saw license plates outside of there that were not new york that were out there doing this, but it's also what I'm saying is we need to, as a committee also address knuckleheads and fools busy running around disturbing this community, make giving businesses like yours a bad name by going out there acting a fool outside of your establishment. That needs to be addressed. We cannot just say: well we're not going to solve this. We don't. We don't solve the other problems that are also occurring in this community. There are people like you said these drag races. Why are they why they outside your place? And while we let these people come in here, acting like th? This is this is a free-for-all. Why is that even allowed? That's and people are going to do people don't know all they see. Is your business and they're going to see these fools and they're going to just say it's businesses, all the business businesses doing it right. So what I'm saying is this needs to be a conversation. We can't get all the knuckleheads to pass. I support businesses as much as anybody else, but what I do not support is people not doing what they're supposed to do and hurting the businesses like yours that are legit doing what they're supposed to do following all the rules and making problems for a legit business like you and that's what I don't want to see and we're not addressing that we keep getting past that we keep speaking past it. Well, we don't know we need to address that. My recommendation is what I said. We need to address these people that are doing this stuff. Well, I, for one, was one of the people that are that said that you know been leading efforts. It's like do a task force to bring all these agencies together, to bring small business to the table, to bring all these people together and elected officials to come up with these solutions, to figure out how to deal with these knuckleheads that are out here doing stuff that they're not supposed to because the end of the day they hurt people like this woman, that's and that's what that's real. At the end of the day, these fools are hurting legit people that have nothing to do with it. So that's my susanna. I welcome you to the table if you want to you're dealing with doing this task force that you come to the table and that you and other businesses talking about the noise task force the task force that was pitched at the noise pollution public hearing on august 4th, okay, so yeah. We took that we took years- and I say years I mean years to get to the table to talk about these foods exactly the type of stuff she's talking about from the drag racers to people acting foolish outside of these businesses causing people problems. That's the type of stuff that we want to address and what I am saying is that needs to be part of the conversation. It can't be well we're going to just fools the past because we can't do that. It's hurting the people who are doing what they're supposed to do. We have to address that too, and without my solution is that we need. I welcome you to be a part of that conversation so that we can address those bad players along with all some of the other stuff that you're talking about. But I welcome you. I think that needs to be something that you will need to do and I'm sorry I'm giving you another job, because you don't deserve that yeah, but I wouldn't please do somebody yeah right and if we bring you and other business owners that are that are that need this relief from these fools. Please come to the table with this task force. Please be a part of that. I hear that people often get, but we have to be very careful. You know on how we address other people right because those fools who knows those fools might be cops. You call I'm sure you call 911 all the time right so yeah, because I got to get some sleep because I actually work okay and I got to get some sleep okay. So yes, I'm going to do that. I'm sure and I don't call 9-1-1 I go. I call 3-1-1, I'm speaking to the parks department right now, I'm dealing with the first department right now back and forth because it seems like you're pretty sure I you know it's not a back and forth. I'm talking and you're interrupting me and I'm saying right now, I'm saying what I said. Thank you. Thank you for your recommendation. Like I said we have to be very careful because, as we as we understand, society has already dehumanized certain individuals to the point where the people feel that their lives are not worth it. So we have to be very careful with our language and understanding that society is very complex and with those complexities we also have to push ourselves to be able to understand and be able to really understand that. This is something that's not new, you know and that this is something that historically has had certain like evolutions and etc. But I was just going to say: let's be careful with how we address other human beings and let's be careful with what we try to imply when we are speaking, that's about it just to close out susana, because there's a lot going on and it's already 8 20.. I want to thank you for coming by. I understand that it's very stressful, that's why I commend you for being able to speak your truth. We will save communication, see what we can do on our end, to be able to align any resources, we have available to be able to work with you and but at the same time resolve any of the community complaints that the community might have and see how, if they're real, because from what I've been able to gather from you, there's a lot of stuff, that's just pure speculations and are being created by outside forces that doesn't necessarily have to do with you. So I want to thank you for taking the time for coming by and in our follow up, we'll make sure to really identify who these players are and have ebenezer in the office contact them to provide a follow-up. All right is there anything you would like to say in closing. Okay, before we close just to let you know, since sanitation is not cleaning the street, you see the garbage can that they put on the street that one we are taking care of, that I take care of the one between broadway and diamond all the way down, so I bought 10. Big garbage can- and I put it right next to mama sushi and every time we change the garbage bag, we put them in there. Just in case. One of my employees told me that somebody came and took a picture of that, but the reason why I have it up there and because we are the one who cleaning the street between broadway all the way to payson yeah correct so because sanitation is not picking up the garbage, so we are responsible for that. We have in total in total six big garbage can that we have to collect every day like two or three times a day when it gets full. We take them and we bring that over here at night. I take it out myself with my garbage and I put them in there. Okay, that's understandable, especially it's going to get worse with the 20 cut that they're about to receive so yeah, but they already took a picture and that pinch is going to put up look mama sushi now is trying to take all the black pudding. All this garbage can outside and that's the reason why they're outside, because we have to collect all the garbage from everywhere, because we don't want diamond to look like a lack of you know like a garbage, can right now that is garbage all over the place. Okay, thank you. Work have a good one. Thank you everybody for listening to me. Thank you. Thank you. Everybody. Thank you. Thank you all right. So there was some questions that we will about seems like there's a lot of people worried about awnings safety on the streets. We will get susana since you're still here, there's so there's a question and they've asked it like 20 times so that means they must know this page, because that was the same thing that the page was attacking me about that the awning has a big hole that by the fire department. I asked the fire department how big I have to leave that and they help me with that. So I follow the rule and regulation of the city of new york because it wasn't the answer because it wasn't unanimous person. It was an unanimous attendee. I can't take. I can take it to you now outside and I can show you a big hole that that's what I need to have in there by the by the city of new york. You know to have that awning over there. That's for the 5's k. If it's an emergency, they have to jump through there, okay and we don't put tables in there. We don't put table no table all right. So that's your response. So now we're going to transition over to to the next item on the agenda, which is community partner, updates. You see that do you have any updates from the bid. Has the bid worked on anything in the summer, so we worked on distributing all the educational literature that was given out by the city to all of our merchants. We also proceeded to give out face coverings to all our merchants, along with social business in the cause to all the merchants in the area. It has been a challenge to me because all of you know as well. We have to do something as far as bringing or doing an update on the social or digital divide that we have in our community. A lot of our merchants are having problems because and again one can attest to this. The accountant mess up or the content didn't give you the proper attention or love and all dimensions themselves didn't have the documents in place, so there has to be an education aspect of it. I think that in different areas, if we have all this information available, it can help a lot of them, but we need food on the grounds we need more resources so that this information can be distributed equally and proportionately to all merchants. I find out that the issue about the hispanic federation in handling a grant that was given through the office of congressman espana and the hospital the complaint that I have heard is that it has to be transparent. This list, whoever is keeping this list open, should make this list open and available to everyone as to who received the grant and how much I have spoken with people from iran group and they have. They have stated that they cannot lay out or distribute the list. I don't know why, and that was the main argument that this lady from I and he said calallero. She was complaining about how come this list is not available. How come this is not made public. We need to know who's getting what, from the big perspective, I'm a little bit concerned about that. My merchants have not been properly awarded this grant. I think that they all are deserving. We need to find out what is that we have to do as an agency to make sure that we provide all information and, besides providing information, you know it's a lot of work. It's a lot of work to contact all these businesses, one by one oftentimes they're, not at the store. You have to come back three or four times a day to see if they're there and I'm not blaming the the merchants, because you know our merchants, they have to be the accountant. They have to be the dishwasher. They have to be the bartender they're gonna do a lot of things right. So, if we're going to make a commitment that we want to help the community, let's be transparent, okay, what's the name of the grant? I'm sorry so I could follow up. So you said this was something done by yeah panic federation, along with the hospital. So from my understanding the person responsible for managing it was hispanic federation. The money was given from the hospital and I guess the congressman helped promote correct okay. So we have to be reaching out to somebody at the hospital who, okay, so what's the name? That's the uptown. What was the name of the grant? It was a name for it was the uptown I'll look into it. I cannot recall the name of hand, but you know those were the concerns that elizabeth caballero was going to bring to the meeting. Okay- and I think is this is a real concern and it should not be a problem that this be addressed, especially if there's resources meant towards our community and there's nothing being awarded towards it. I understand what you're saying yeah I do have an update. If it's, if it's now, I can do it now and it's concerning the password on one of your first, so you want to leave that for later on. This is this is your time now, so you have another five minutes before we move on. I know jacqueline from cloth will not be available due to she's she transitioned out to our previous job. I believe she's working for the east side settlement and then the individuals from the both chambers never responded so you're, the only one, so you gotta, I can't even give you an additional five minutes. Okay, so great and again going back to this grant. The chamber shouldn't have gone more information. The community board should have been involved in this committee because I I'm sure, the mingle that you will know a lot of businesses that, because you are on the ground, you understand their problems see. So you know that's just something that I wanted to add now coming back to the bus ride, don't know if you guys are familiar, but the city and d.o.t they are proposing to make one reverse between amsterdam to broadway as a bus way. Similar to what 14th street is all about right now, I could understand the city in promoting this idea, but as scale brewer once said, you know we want to make sure that if this is going to happen that boosts on the ground get in place, because we really have to dissect how this is going to affect northern Manhattan, and there are many different reasons from part losing parking spots to the critical question about safety on a friday afternoon. God forbid, there's a fire on money fresh between ottawa and saint nicholas. The firefighters will not be able to get in because it's so densely congested. So I can see the city perspective on this right, but your committee should be invited to a meeting. That's going to take place this thursday you're familiar with that domingue right. The meeting is scheduled, so denise is aware, and so is the chair elizabeth. They are invited on this meeting and I think that you and your committee members should be invited to this meeting because you have different perspective right. That's gonna, take place on this thursday at three o'clock. Vanessa has all information, so he can share that later on now, if you, if you think about the postwar right, when you take into account the hotel that is going to open up on it first, the office tower that's going to open up only first in amsterdam, the retail space is going to open up on the young wood project, plus the new charter school. That's going to open up right next to it. It's going to open up within a year and a half the mainly more the mini mall coming to 180 first target is coming 21st and saint nicholas chipotle is coming to 180th and broadway, so this area is popping I mean I appreciate all this development, but we also have to be cognizant of the problems they're going to face. I have spoken with yeshiva university they're a little bit concerned about the impact that the Bronx mahanbound traffic is going to have on yeshiva university. I'm also concerned about the impact it's going to have on our local schools. As you know, domingo you are 1833 and in westworth, but we have at least four different schools from amsterdam to broadway. I want to be second when all these things open up, it's going to be chaotic now. The question that I raised previously in the meeting was d.o.t must make an assessment on how things are going to affect. If this password is going to be implemented, I have spoken with a lot of businesses. The main concern about is just losing participation spaces, but they also understand that it's going to create more food traffic, it's going to increase our sale and we understand that when sale, increases and promise and promise away to not going to be affected and thus keeping you know a lot of employees in line right. So those are the key factors that from economic development, we want to make sure that they are there keeping jobs, bringing new air business to the area but at the same time, keep a sanity in the sense of traffic mess. So it's going to create some issues. We have to ask dlt about the assessment to see how things are going to be played in a domino effect. What the traffic is going to go, the Bronx bound traffic will have to use either 183rd or 180th. So imagine all the traffic going to these streets. It's going to be immense if they have a an answer for that that'll be great, but these are things that we have to make sure that we answer and that we ask and it's unfortunate, that everything impacts us disproportionately. They close down the the end, the entrance via the fort washington via the park. To a and now you see this congestion on broadway between one I mean fairview, which is like 190 all the way to 190. I think that's nagel, where it's non-stop traffic for no reason you know- and I think yeah so I'll reach out to the chair, I'll, get more information and I'll email it to everybody in the committee just in case they want to participate. I will also be emailing. Susana sent me the picture of the of the it's the it's an awning by the fire skate. She it's the proper them like I'll, send it to everybody. Just so, everybody could see that it. Actually it's into compliance with the fire department and if there's anything else, is there any old business that we haven't touched upon new business with that yeah I have some new business. What's the new business, let's see, I was thinking that you already talked about this, but just that we discussed at open restaurants open streets. What does what what's going to happen to our businesses once winter hits and that's a concern? Yes, but that's that was one and then I wanted to talk about. I wanted. I was interested in terms of the impact of the shutdown in terms of our business vacancy rates. Before the pandemic, we had a high a much a higher vacancy rate than all of Manhattan, and so I I'm curious about who survived and who didn't and what that means like how many businesses did we lose and what is the impact and implications of that for for this community? You know so yeah I mean. I know that I don't know who conducted that study. Do you have anybody in mind? Well, I mean cough, of course, did the avenue NYC? They did the survey that, of course, they came before us last september pandemic right that was prepared them and we were still very high like 19 or so it was very high. I don't want to quote a wrong percentage, but it was higher than Manhattan, but I was just curious now that we've come out because we've talked nationally about all the businesses that are closing and that half closed and they did not survive, and I just want to know what that impact. What did the pandemic do to our community? Correct? Yes, it's seizure, I'm sorry go ahead, yeah, that's something that we're going to have to reach out to the comptroller. I guess he's the one that does those type of studies yeah, so we just conducted a survey within the pit here right and we have about 250 businesses. Tania word of mouth has come to me that we have lost about four businesses due to coverage, including a typical domingo, which is a large restaurant. Yeah they're gone they're gone, and that was because of kobe big problems where we lost close to a hundred people that used to work there. Really sad and then we lost three all the smaller businesses who you know, owners passed or have been extremely sick and they could no longer, you know, keep the places open. So we lost like about four businesses. Now broadway has a problem when it comes to a vacancy and that's citywide, and when cloth presented the findings, we found that, like tanya, you indicated anywhere from 17 to 19 of vacancy that is really high within the paid on 181st. It's lower we're standing at around 8.7 right now, which is really low. I will tell you that we did some study pre-kobe and that was about 13 the city. I just gave us a good news that we're going to do further studies on dikeman and inward, so we're going to do a research to see how covert affected the vacancy rate in england so we're going to have people on the ground once we gather all the resources. So we're going to have some answers for you, tanya about how many businesses were hit and affected by kobe, hopefully within a couple of months, all right so back to it back to my id around the need for a town hall so and I'll hit up a few of the other of the associations to so that we could do a town hall either next month for the month after around the impact, but also how do we move forward and how do we provide support to small businesses moving forward? And how do we effectively advocate so that businesses, if they, if they're, not supposed to open, then the city should be able to take out loans to be able to give to these businesses to be able to replace their income loss? And I think that's going to be extremely important. That demands are established because I'm not the type that's going to encourage people to go clean the streets when our taxes pla pay for sanitation. You know, so I think it's extremely important that as taxpayers, we are also taking full advantage of the resources that we're paying for- and I think that's something- that's very- is extremely important to know. We are paying for these resources that the city does. It has certain shortfalls, that's their responsibility, but as taxpayers we're already contributing, we want our streets to be clean and we also want some sort of bailout for our small businesses so that we could be able to still engage them and frequent them as we as we. So with that, I will be speaking to as I make strides with, contacting these individuals I'll report back to the committee. As far as who has signed up susana for in town hall sovereign. How do we move forward as a community pasel demands asia city hall? What do we expect for the survival of not only our small businesses but our community, because our community are employed by these small businesses? Is enough with the rhetoric now it's time to actually advocate and do what we got to do to make sure that we bring the funding to our community and with that being said, do I get a motion to adjourn motion to adjourn from nobles? Second, any second circuit. Thank you very much. Everybody thanks! Amigo! Do your night and I'll see y'all next month. Thank you good. To meet you brother. Take it easy man, bye, y'all, come here guys good night.
