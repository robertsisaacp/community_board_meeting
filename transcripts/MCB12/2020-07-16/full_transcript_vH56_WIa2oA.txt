Three million reported cases new york city has two hundred and sixteen thousand eight hundred and thirty four reported cases, and in Manhattan in particular, there are twenty seven thousand six hundred and forty one confirmed cases and, as many of you may have heard in the news, there is a slight uptick in positive cases among the 20 to 29 year old demographic, we're not exactly sure at this point. What is causing that, but, as we all know, as the city has begun to open up, there are people gathering outdoor dining. There have been protests and people exercising their right to protest. So all of this could contribute to that particular segment of the population, seeing an increase in positive cases, but what we really want to make sure people are aware of is to maintain the core four, which is stay home if you're sick, maintain social distancing whenever possible, you know pretty much always wear face covering in public if you can't maintain social distancing and wash your hands frequently. As you may also know, the state has issued a joint travel advisory with connecticut and new jersey requiring individuals from certain states to have a mandatory quarantine for 14 days. I can provide a link to the state's website for all of those states that are included in this travel advisory, and then large gatherings are cancelled through september 30th, but child care programs have been allowed to reopen just because they're allowed to reopen doesn't mean they should or they want to. But if you get any questions about child care facilities, they are allowed to be open at this point and I think I'll just open it up to any specific questions. People may have thank you pauline. I just want to make. I just want to note for the benefit of people in our community, that I want to bring the statistics down to our community level. So at this point, according to the doh website, there have been 910 deaths in our four zip codes and zip codes. 32 and 40 rank 77 and 78 out of the 177 zip codes in the city in terms of cases per 100, 000 and zip code. 32 has had 281 deaths, the code 40 has had 263 zip code 33, which ranks as number 94 has had 203 deaths and there's a code 34 which ranks at 126 has had 163 deaths. Now, let me ask you pauline when these deaths are listed on the doh website. Are those con confirmed deaths or are they also probable deaths? So I think there's a tab that differentiates between confirmed and probable. Let me just double check our website to see whether or not the ones listed in the data page specifically per zip code is confirmed, I'm pretty sure they are confirmed, but let me just double check that. Are there any questions, while I'm checking our website yeah? Are there any other questions? Yes, I have a question or two all right is that sally yep go ahead. Okay in terms of the uptick in the 20 to 24 year olds. Have you do you have any data on where those cases are coming from, because I can tell you at our open street on dikeman, it's a super spreader event every day, so yeah right. So the age range is the 29 to a 20 to 29 age group, and as of right now we aren't seeing the typical, where we were seeing disparities prior so neighborhoods, where we were seeing disparities or poverty rates if there's they're, not sort of overlapping. So we're thinking it's because of the reopening that is causing some of the uptick yeah and then my other question is: have you made any progress with the contact tracing? I know at one point the response rates were in the 30s, so I can definitely circle back with h with regards to their test and trace program. I the last I heard was that they are doing slightly better in terms of you know, reaching out to contacts and people providing helpful contacts. But let me circle back with their team and I can email steve some more information for him to share with everyone. That would be extremely helpful. I appreciate that any other questions- steve yeah, ms barna, yes, hi, tanya- hold off for a moment- oh sure, but paola. I see betty lehman's name on the additional attendees list, she's not on the main list. Is she promoted? Has she been promoted? She has he's on now, yeah he's on okay, very good, all right tanya, I'm sorry go ahead. Yes, I actually, I saw a question in the box that said someone asked claudia asks: has anyone considered whether the uptick in positive cases in 20 to 29 year olds has anything to do with fireworks and motorcycle parties? So maybe I don't know paul pauline if you wanted to address that, so I don't believe we have any specific data as to what could be causing this uptick right now. You know, but we have heard that there have been a lot of gatherings where fireworks have been used and other things I haven't heard about this motorcycle situation, but you know any time where people are gathered in large crowds, not practicing social distancing and not wearing the proper face coverings can all potentially be contributing to this uptick. So while I don't have that specific information, this information about these parties and fireworks and gatherings, is it's something you can call into 3-1-1 and have the mayor's office of special enforcement send out people like if you know, there's a particular party that happens every single night or every single saturday at a particular time. I think that would be really helpful to let the mayor's office know so they can send out folks to either hand out face masks or you know, do some education break up some parties again. We don't really want to be sending NYPD out to these situations at this point, but I think it's really important that people still understand that Covid-19 is still a concern and we don't want to go backwards and start closing things down again, like other states have had to do well. I'd say what we have in this community are: are people who are just hanging out on the streets at night having their own little parties and not wearing masks, and you know they bring out their beach chairs or whatever, and they just sit on the sidewalk and they stay out all night long. So I don't I do you think this is something the mayor's office of special enforcement could respond to this would have this is a late night situation. I mean it wouldn't hurt to let them know- and I know the mayor's community affairs unit has also expressed that if communities are seeing particular issues and concerns that they should be notified as well, so I am thinking that they would potentially send out inspectors from various agencies to come out and see what's happening with regards to any restaurants and the open, dining stuff. I think the governor just announced, because he's very concerned as well that there's a three strikes in your closed rule, so if they are notified of a particular establishment that is not following any of the guidelines, and you know, inspectors are sent out three times and they're found to be in violation there. The state will close that establishment. So I think it's really helpful just to let the city know what's happening so that you know bad actors will have to be addressed. I'm just getting curious on this issue on this issue. We don't have h and their their tracing unit on this call right. No, we don't know, I didn't okay, I didn't invite them, but but pauline is that something they might know in terms of pinpointing. I don't know how specific they can get geographically speaking yeah I mean it might still be a little bit early, but I'm pretty sure they have preliminary data as to what zip codes they're seeing more of a uptick in positive cases, so yeah, I think it wouldn't hurt to reach out to h test and trace to see what their, what they're recording pauline. I wonder I'm just sort of following up on that: the open streets open restaurants was put out rather quickly. I mean both from the business standpoint. I think they revise the regulations, but there's a lot of things that are supposed to be being enforced by the restaurants, which clearly are not being re enforced. I wonder if it makes sense for department of health and mental hygiene to have a direct conversation with department of transportation and the mayor's office of special enforcement, so that at that level you can actually address those problems and reiterate what the regulations are. We can always call and complain, but I haven't heard of one successful open street open restaurant- it's just not working, it's not being enforced, and if we talk to our police they say well, people can't have mass on because they're eating- and it's you know it's not just that. It's the crowds of people waiting to be seated. It's the parties that are going on surrounding these open streets and I think that a conversation has to be had at a higher level so that, what's not being done, can sort of be done. All over the city, because I have no doubt that the rise in cases is a direct result of what's going on in our streets. Sure I think the coordination is happening. I think just unfortunately, because of how quickly things were rolled out. It's just difficult to have. You know restaurants or operators who are really hell-bent on just getting their business back, to really try and do their best in terms of maintaining that social distancing for folks who are waiting or just following the rules. There are some restaurants that really are trying their best, but unfortunately there are a lot of people who are really just not following the guidelines that the state has put out so yeah. Absolutely, I think city hall is very well aware of the situation where people are gathering- and you know, restaurants are not following the rules, and I think now the governor is very concerned too. So I think there is that coordinated effort now with enforcement. I think earlier with the rollout. It was more about educating folks and not trying to find them right away because, of course, they've been out of business for a while, and we didn't want to be punitive towards them, but I think now that they've had a chance to really understand what's happening. I think enforcement will start rolling out in a much more aggressive manner. Great. Thank you yeah, sorry to interrupt richard allman needs promoted. If you don't mind yeah, I just want to step in really quickly paulie, I'm sorry just to kind of echo what I've what's been stated already and also just add a little bit more context. I do think we're beyond the point of just grace period. It seems like there was this time period where businesses were allowed to keep their establishments and kind of operate, as you know, in an effort to get their businesses and make some money after being out of work for such a long time. But we see the uptick happening and I think it's a it's a larger danger to the community to allow this to continue to happen. I've caught for my very first time. Last week I caught 301 myself and they did respond, but I'm just so you so which I missed earlier. You were saying that after three kind of violations are they are they being fined after one incident or does it take several incidents to occur for them to be defined for their infraction? Could you kind of well, I think I, as I understand the governor's three strikes and you're out policy. It really involves liquor licenses. Am I correct on that pauline yeah? I think I think what he's doing and they did they did it with the white horse tavern in the village. Is they they rescinded the liquor license for establishments that are not observing social distancing at least three times yeah, because I knew that happened. That was a great example of what the possibilities are, but my concern is: we have the grace period, for you know for several almost a month now right and then now we're saying the three strikes, I'm not sure if waiting three times for the infraction is the right approach. If there is, someone has had a grace period for a month already and now we're entering you know and they're in you know, they've had several visits. You know. Even one business visit is enough to be fine in my personal opinion, at this stage of where we are because of the uptick in numbers. So I'm just wondering: are there? No? Are there? No, you know sort of violations or summons being issued after the first or second violation. Is it only after the third? So I think yeah right. So there are two different or separate sort of ways that a business can be fined or punished. So the one with the gay governor just announced was through the sla and taking away their liquor license, which I believe a lot of businesses really depend on their liquor, license to recoup a lot of their lost revenue, but for the city side I believe that if any of the inspectors, so it could be a dohmh inspector, it could be a DOT inspector. It could be a fdny inspector anyone who's sort of in this coalition of inspectors to go out to inspect social distancing violations and open dining if they find that a restaurant is in violation. I believe that they can issue a fine right away and I believe that d.o.t can shut down that operation. So I don't have the specifics of what the like fine schedule is, for example, but I can look that up and I'll definitely send that over. Thank you very much all right. Thank you steve. Once again, I now want to announce that we have a quorum. We have seven committee members as well as four other board members, so very we can. We can proceed now in good faith. I just had a question about that last point. I think what folks have been talking about and steve. You might know this better. Obviously, when it comes to the licensing committee, there's a number of questions that they ask in during their meetings, how do we work with them to get these health related questions onto their business? So they're asking whether or not you know folks have had violations as it relates to you know Covid-19 and whatnot, and what are their procedures for? Oh, I think that's an excellent point. I don't know that they're holding any more meetings of during the summer to review, license applications, but it would still be relevant, I'm sure in september, and we should certainly talk to a sidro and and I'll pass it on to him. That's a very good point, steve tanya yeah. I wanted to say as much as I'm on the business development committee as well, so I also agree with daryl like that needs to be also on the agenda for business development, but also, I wanted to say a lot of this. You know this lack of social distancing, lack of mask wearing that's happening just by people hanging out on the street. Like honestly, I have contacted you know, call 311 reported that there are. There are literally whole parties of 30 people right on the block on the sidewalk pregnant women, with children out partying at 11 o'clock at night. Well, that was the past yeah. That was the point I was trying to make earlier that that I think a part of this problem is the people just hanging out on the streets having their own late night parties outside their buildings. You know bringing out chairs and just hanging around on the sidewalks and here's the thing steve what they said to what you know the police show up right, they say: well, we give these people some, we give them some, you know a summons or whatever, but then they're right back doing it there's no way to like stop people from doing this. You know because those things don't mean anything, and so I mean it's just really frustrating it's like this is putting our whole community at risk. You know for to people like, as curtis was saying, keep allowing people to keep doing it again and doing it again and again and there's no penalty, then what I think there needs to be some type of penalty. That's actually going to be meaningful in order for people to be a disincentive for people to continue to engage in this behavior and steve just to point out in the chat. Also, two people have brought up specific spots in the neighborhood broadway and 161st street, as well as elwood and hillside, so I just wanted. Well, I tell you, I think we should compile a list, but the list, I think, is going to be very long, so we we should. We should have a further discussion about how to how to handle that and pauline I'll talk to you further offline. So we can figure out whether it's the office of special enforcement or some other entity that should respond. Okay, any other questions for pauline. I just want to add. I'm sorry can I just add one point, I'm sorry to jump in here too much steve where public safety matters, but then NYPD they're no longer enforcing social distancing. So that's a really important thing to mention to everyone on the call and who's listening I I've had several, I believe bernard is on the call. I talked to him several times he lives at you know, 161st street. I received complaints all the way up from inward as well about the same particular issue about no one really is enforcing. Nypd is not enforcing for discussing, and you know I think that there's a lack of enforcement happening right now in the community and it is concerning so I do agree with tanya. We have to figure out a way, I'm not I'm not sure who should be responsible, but we have to figure out how to make someone responsible yeah like curtis. I would just add you know oftentimes. We refer people to the precinct community council meetings. Is it even worth it for this meeting they're not meeting? No, I know they're not meeting right now, but I mean when they go back but daryl they have. They basically said we're not enforcing yeah. Early. Fourth doesn't even understand what social distancing is, nor do they understand what a mask is, but I mean they're hands-on. They put up barricades in front of their precinct. That's right, but I mean you know if a complaint is filed and I don't believe that the police are the right people to enforce it anyway, I'm trying to get them out of the business of import of them right all right, maybe we're closing out complaints as soon as they're filed yeah. Well, that's another issue. We should talk about at some point all right, I think paulie we can excuse pauline. Thank you pauline. Thank you for getting back getting back to your original question. There is a chart for confirmed deaths and then there is a chart for confirmed and probable on our data page. So if you want to just double check the information that you looked up, but we have both so the zip code breakdown that I'm looking at there are. There are two different zip code, breakdowns, one that incorporates the probables as well as the confirmed yep. So I can send you a link to both in an email all right, yeah. Please do that! Okay, because I'm, I think, I'm only looking at the one for confirmed deaths, which is which is bad enough. You know right all right. Very good, thank you all have a good evening all right. Thank you again. Pauline all right columbia is up next ross. Are you on the line? Yes, I am. Do you want to introduce your colleagues sure very quickly, I'm joined by several people. Some of you may have met. Obviously sandra harris is with us tonight. Dr rafael antigua is also with us, both of whom have obviously been to community board meetings held this committee before, but also joined by two colleagues from our department of psychiatry, dr harold pincus and linda rosenberg, a member of our faculty in psychiatry. You're gonna talk about an initiative they're working on in terms of providing increased mental health services to the northern Manhattan area, so harold and linda I'm just going to turn it over to you. If that's okay, thanks ross one. Second, though, before we let ross go, I want to once again acknowledge the archie bunker easy chair in the corner, I hope you're getting full use of it during the Covid-19 19 period. Yes, indeed, yes, indeed, all right, very good, I'm sorry, dr pinkus sure so I'm harold pinkes. I have several roles, but I'm a professor I'm vice chair of psychiatry at columbia, and I also am the co-director of the irving institute for clinical and translational research. So I just want to say hi to fern who's. Here we work very closely with her and, and so what we focused on is the fact that you know the Covid-19 19 pandemic is something that you know, on the one hand, focuses primarily on issues around infection control and has had a devastating impact in terms of health care, and that's and the focus is not just on health care, though it also affects behavioral health care. It has affected every single citizen in our community in all kinds of ways, not just the added stress that they experience, but the grief that families have had to deal with the impact of unemployment, the impact of the exacerbation of existing mental health and addiction problems that has gone on, and it has had a significant component that is affecting not only sort of people getting hit by the virus and families, but it's affecting everybody, young and old, of all stripes, and it's also laid bare. Not just the tremendous exist existing needs for behavioral health in the community, but also the significant disparities that are faced by different populations that have been traditionally underserved, and so that's really called our attention to figuring out how to deal with some of these issues. On the I guess I wouldn't say positive side there's also been an opportunity to kind of learn about new in a bit innovative ways to address mental health needs. Obviously, the advances in telemedicine, telemental healthcare, using technology in different ways and also the way in which people have begun to think of ways that specifically, are dealing with some of the unique stresses that come up in the context of they come up in the context of a pandemic like this. So our department, a group of us in our department, along with others, at columbia, university at irvine medical center, including dr lantigua and others, come together to try to think about. What could we do? What could we think about in terms of proposing to try to make things better and try to deal with the both the existing behavioral health needs that are facing our community and disparities that exist, but also to address the impact of Covid-19 19 itself? And so we came up with what we think is a kind of an integrated sort of initiative that addresses several things. One number one: it supports efforts to respond to the behavioral health needs of northern Manhattan number two. It's ideas to foster community resilience and wellness overall, not just deal with specific behavioral health problems. We want to support the existing community based network and social care network and organizations in the community, but also as we do this- to serve as kind of a local and national model for how to address behavioral health needs. In this context, and also with a particularly innovative approach, would be to provide training and employment for community lay persons as part of a new community behavioral health corps. So what we put together is a composite of six different ideas that are all kind of linked and integrated, but are based upon sort of our experiences and some of the tools and and resources that we've, you know, think that are needed for this area. So number one is focusing on the needs of health care workers. In this case, we've actually had some direct experience in doing that, the you know being the epicenter of the pandemic. You know, especially in terms of what we've been faced with at new york, presbyterian hospital and at columbia university medical center, especially over the you know. The past several months had a huge impact on the on the mental well-being of our healthcare workers and, as a result, we developed a very innovative approach to try to deal with some of those issues that we've called coke columbia and I'll come back to that in a bit and linda will also sort of expand on that number two. We think that an important element of a strategy to respond to these needs is also to build linkages and support with existing licensed behavioral health facilities in the community. Both from the mental health side, as well as from the addiction side, and to do that in a way that supports them using sort of telehealth services and also this notion of a community behavioral health corps that I'll speak about in a few minutes. Number three is that we also want to make sure that there's linkages to existing community-based organizations that are providing primarily social services, because many people who come through, who have these social service needs, are significantly affected by behavioral health problems and that are exacerbated by the pandemic number. Four. Many of the of the primary care providers in the community see what's going on in terms of mental health, stress, depression, anxiety, increased substance use and they need additional support so to think about how we can advance integrated primary care and behavioral health care with local primary care providers. Number five is that we want to create this behavioral health core, which is an important part of their strategy. That actually would engage. People in the community lay people in the community and train them in providing behavioral health services, providing supervision for that, integrating them into these other four components and then, finally, we want to do this in a way we can continually assess how we're doing continuously improve the work that comes out of these initiatives and really make it a sort of national example of a learning health system and community partnership model. So why don't I stop there and linda? Let you sort of expand on some of these items and especially the behavioral health service corps? Oh one, second, I want you to repeat that last sentence about the national example. What was the rest of it that I want that we would create a national example of a of what might be termed a learning health system and community partnership model that there really would be nothing like this in the country. So that's what I was referring to so thank you and okay, very good. Thank you and thank you for having us this evening and a particular thanks to dr lentigua, who really came, I think, to our chair, jeffrey lieberman, and said our community is suffering you're part of that community. How can we be helpful? So thank you and I'm very happy to be here tonight. I hope you'll feel free to interrupt me by the way, and I really you know you don't want to invite us to do that. You'll, never finish it's okay! I can handle it, but it is really a pleasure. I want to talk a little bit about a few things. First of all, we want to do this in a very respectful manner. You have community-based organizations that have their own boards that have been providing services, including the fqhcs that are sitting right on the screen in front of me this morning and that do a really good job. Then you have the services that actually the state runs and pays for you know our washington heights community services and inpatient unit, and then we have new york presbyterian and everybody tries hard. Everybody does good things and there are always some new and innovative programs, but for the average person, including myself, when we go to find care, we often can't, even though these services exist- and one of the things we'd like to do by bringing these organizations together in a more robust manner, is make no door the wrong door so that there would be actual referrals between them sharing of information and really it would appear seamless, and it would be a seamless experience for the families living in the community from the elderly really to young people. One of the things the state is going to be doing is making available to your licensed mental health and addiction organizations that currently exist, they're going to be giving them online trainings around dealing with ptsd grief, and so that will be rolled out. We expect in the coming months, but they're not going to put their arms around this particular community and say we can work together, better everybody always wants to, but it's hard to do. We think we can make progress in that way. I think the other thing is the community organizations, including the churches in the community, are a great source of information and comfort, particularly with the grief that people are dealing with, and I think again, the state plans are making some online resources available to them and all the citizens in new york state. We want to actually get involved with some of those premier organizations and make sure they too can make referrals that are necessary and needed, so they don't hit a brick wall when they're trying to get help for someone- and the next part is something dr lantigua's been doing. The fqhcs have been doing, which is offering mental health and addiction screening and short-term treatment right within primary care. Well, you have primary care practices that don't have the wherewithal to do that. What we'd like to do is make psychiatric consultation available to them, as they do screenings and identify people from the faculty at columbia and do that virtually because a lot of treatment is now going on virtually and in addition to that, take this behavioral health core that we're discussing and train them really to be care managers. One of the things I'm personally very passionate about is that the behavioral health core, which are community members, have a career path and I've seen it done in other places where people are able to move on then to college, to professional degrees, to nursing and really you know to gain the on hands-on experience and we would help them along that career path. So those are the pieces and that's the reason for this is trying to give back in many ways. You know colombia is a big piece of that community and I think we have to be good neighbors and give support where we can and so we're very excited about the possibility of doing more and being an even better resource. So I'd love to hear your thoughts and your questions, as I'm sure, would harold. Well, let me just open it up by saying that the expansion of mental health services in the community has been the number one budget priority of this committee and the community board. I believe for the last at least two years, so we absolutely would welcome any additional services coming into the community and especially from the medical center, with your expertise and the certainly the idea of linkages strengthening the linkages with existing cbo's. It makes a lot of sense and I have a for. When do you expect to be able to launch this initiative, and is this dependent upon your getting funding or is the funding already in place? How would you pay for the behavioral health corps? Among other things, it is dependent upon our getting funding and we have not gotten funding we're looking at both government but we're also looking at private philanthropy. You know we really have begun reaching out to foundations as well. There are foundations, certainly in the city, so this you know we're thinking about a three-year project. Hopefully the pieces that really do make a difference could continue. Some of it could be billable in insurance, but we're just at a beginning stage, and so what we may need from you is help as the city and the state look towards funding, they're gonna get to deal with Covid-19 19 that some of it be allocated to the you know, projects we've described. I think the other thing that I'm just beginning to think about really and actually talk with dr lieberman about this morning- is: I think we can expect as the fall ends and winter begins to perhaps have a resurgence. You know we have enough problems now with the 20 to 29 year olds, hanging out in the street. Well, when people start having to be indoors, will we see you know a real spike and you know how much can people tolerate most people will do okay with just a little support and help, but when you look at people, my age actually and the kind of high-risk groups, you know people who have comorbid physical illnesses, people over 60, I mean you have people in the community who will get increasingly frightened if this happens in the fall and there's another spike, and I think we have to be there for them all right. Well, I think I'm not going too far out on a limb by saying that the community board would welcome the opportunity to work with you to make this a reality. Let me ask you you're used to some abbreviation earlier was, did you say fqhc was that your appreciation generally qualified health center, but brian and his colleague can certainly explain what that is? Oh, okay, all right! You have to you have to excuse us. We don't know all the lingo. Oh, I try not to use lingo, but you know we always fall back into our league, though all right- and actually I am hoping that that we can establish some cooperative arrangement between you and and the ryan health center. I'm going to have the ryan helsing to make a presentation next, so maybe you guys can hang around for it by the way we also, I mean you know, we we've laid out kind of an outline of what we think makes sense, but we definitely want to engage the community in further refining that all right, very good. Maybe we could have. Maybe we could have a sit down at some point and and go through it in more detail. Any questions from all committee members sally. I know you have a question. Catherine, go ahead, hi everyone! I had two things one I know: will there be partnership with nyp Queens in terms of this project and I might have missed it, but is there a larger research component to it as well I'll? Let harold answer the research piece of it because he is our research guru so on the research center? Yes, the idea would be that it would not be sort of research, traditional research, but it would be research that is part of a continuously evaluating process to understand what, whether the innovations that we're implementing as part of this are working and if they're not working as well as we think, is there a way to improve them. So it's a continuous improvement model that involves research but also documenting the success and actually promulgating what we've learned to to be disseminated. Much more broadly, and I can talk a little bit about the queen's issue. You know we've been focused, obviously on washington heights and inwood. It's an area dear and close to my heart. I grew up in the marvel hill projects actually spent a lot of time in wood. So, although I haven't been back in a long time, I feel quite connected to it. I know Queens has been very heavily hit and I was in elmhurst recently at elmhurst, the city hospital and they really were devastated at one point: we're not looking at that right now, but it doesn't mean that couldn't happen. I think we have to be respectful of the organizations that exist in those communities and their ability and interest to come together. We'd love to have other groups want to do that in other neighborhoods and we'd be more than happy. You know to cooperate and work with them. Well, if this model works, hopefully it can be replicated elsewhere. I don't know dr, let's see why I did not recognize you, okay, you can speak. Thank you chairman, just to let you know that this initiative has been built to serve for contiguous neighborhood. It's hardly mexican americans and puerto ricans harlan african-american, the west Bronx many dominicans and puerto ricans and northern Manhattan. It's part of an initiative that we started and we is a congressman spy, yet josh acosta, who is a trustees at a colombia sargenoso. We said to austin nyp, colombia and myself, among others, and this initiative is called now: the northern Manhattan, the west, Bronx vanguard and again it's been presented this week and we have placenta getting to some of the electoral freezers in harlem and next week is going to be presented to the great harley chamber of commerce. I have been discussed also with elector officers in the Bronx and that vito pichardo, senator cabrera and others are members of this group all right. So it is so it's really it's a much larger. It's a much larger catchment area goes and includes all of harlem and parts of the west and west Bronx colgate right, yes, okay, all right, very good, all right, so, basically, the congressional district, the 13th congressional district part of the 13, those include the northern Bronx, which is at montefiore and those areas. Okay, all right, all right! So, okay, thank you for that. Now what we have in the community we have. I don't know if fountain house is one of the organizations that you're thinking of reaching out to fountain house has a residence on amsterdam avenue between 172nd and 173rd. I don't know that they provide any direct service in the community, but this is an organization that you might want to also consider when, when you're doing linkages to groups in the community, because they I know them well and also dr vassand- is on your faculty- I mean he's someone. You should definitely be talking to all right because I would like to see them get more involved in our community, and maybe this is one way to bring them in and and certainly this is a definitely an organization that has years of expertise, I'm sorry decades of expertise dealing with mental health issues. So I'm saying that sally because I'm preempting you- because I expected you to say it any other questions or comments, sally yeah, I this all sounds great and I'm really glad you're working on it. My concern is that in the new york presbyterian system it looks like we're down now 80 beds, so well, I wonder how we're going to address the needs of the seriously mentally ill, both in our neighborhood, with the failure to reopen- I guess alan, but also what's going on at Brooklyn methodist and while I think this is a great need. I think that those who serious mental illness have sort of been left out of the equation. So just a comment. Well, I'm you know, I can't speak to any of the inpatient facilities in terms of the new york presbyterian, but certainly we would not be excluding people with serious mental illness. In fact, those are the people who are in some ways most at risk right. So we would want to augment those services and also specifically target those individuals with the serious mental illnesses. All right does tonya have a question. Yes, I do steve. There is a question about. Is there a plan to prevent secondary issues such as the multitude of illegal fireworks from adding to the burden born by communities on top of all the other Covid-19 fallout? So if people like health care workers can't sleep that takes an enormous toll on their mental health, can some of you speak to that in terms of what's been happening in our community? That's been happening right now. With I mean literally, I can tell you this. I did not sleep. I was getting two hours of sleep if I was lucky and that's this went on for over a month and I'm actually in an escape apartment to be honest in the community, because I cannot live in my own apartment. So I'm thinking about those health care workers, those essential workers and other people who might be having suffering from mental health issues, because I've had people contact me and say I'm a veteran. I have ptsd and hearing those m80s go off and hearing. This is really detrimental to my mental health. So can you all address like what is it going to be the plan to address those things as well as part of this? It's all people accountable for doing so. Actually, let me, let me add something to that question. I'm wondering, would you would anybody from columbia be aware of any study that possibly has been done on this particular question as to whether or not persistent, repeated fireworks or noise issues like fireworks could have a serious impact? What kind of serious impact it has on people? Is there a study that might exist that we could that we could look at? I'm not aware of a specific study looking at that, but there is no question that sleep disruption and poor sleep has a huge effect on the well-being and functioning of individuals. You know normally and it's especially significant with people that have had pre-existing behavioral health conditions, so you're right, you're, absolutely right that that's a sort of a widely you know, trivialized, not recognized as a as an important contributor to the you know: basic well-being of individuals. You know we're not you know, I don't. I don't think we have the capacity in this initiative to say we're going to interrupt fireworks. You know that's but you're, absolutely right! That's something that really needs to be addressed. Can we address it as a mental as noise pollution as a as a as a public health issue? Is there a way that you all could partner with us to actually address that? And you know that we can do you know we can? At least you know, look at it from that angle. No, we're not going to solve fireworks, but we can actually advocate for on behalf of this being a public health issue. Sorry, it absolutely is a public health issue. I also wonder if we can just get information out. You all have a lot of resources for veterans your pt ptsd studies going on. I just think if there's a way to communicate to the community board, so we can get that information out, because there are resources that our community isn't aware of in terms of health, especially for ptsd y'all are doing a lot of good work in that area. Absolutely. How would we address it as a public health issue? I just feel like a lot of times. These things come up and I'm not trying to interrupt, but I just feel like a lot of times. These things come and we just go right past it just like we did just now. I you know we have people right now suffering our community because of this these issues. What can we do? How can we make this? Make it clear that this is a public health issue? What is going to be done and how can colombia help us nyp help us make this be clear that this is a public health issue and partnering with us and doing something and addressing that as a public health issue tanya. This is sandra. One of the things that we can do is reach out to our school of public health, because this is one area where we can partner with them to work with the board on addressing this, and this is something that we've done in the past and we can connect the right people at our school of public health to work with you on this yeah. I think that would be very useful, because I think we can you we need some kind of backup in order to really send the message that this is how this issue has got to be taken more seriously. So dr lantique had something to say he's trying he was trying to speak steve. I just wanted to let you know that I just want to say that if you address this issue to the environmental department of the school of public health, if we don't have, they don't know the data. This is a good subject to do research on this subject, in that they can have some students, some faculty members. That will give a complete answer to you, but I will say that for the committee to aggressively freight and to the share of the environmental department and I'm sure that we have a lot of interest to come back with if they don't know the answer, I have to say: let's look into the issue all right, all right, that's a good suggestion. So we're going to work with you and sandra on this all right, other all right, steve, I'm sorry, somebody from the public. Are we allowing them to ask questions? Somebody wanted to ask a question yeah. I did one second catherine, did you have a question as well? Catherine, are you still with us? Am I reading this thing correctly or daryl? Are there 18 questions? No, there were some we've answered already. Oh all right so is there? Is there a new question? It looks like fern has a question, and then we can yeah all right. All right, fern go ahead: you're, muted, fern, okay, thanks, oh yeah! Go ahead, go ahead. I've been around the world of mental health and the desperate need for mental health services, particularly for older adults for more than 20 years in this community, and there are less services today than there were 20 years ago. So, no matter what and I love that you want to do this, I think it's awesome. Sustainability is crucial because it's always a funder. It's always a project. It really needs a commitment between the psychiatric institute, presbyterian hospital and colombia to say, with or without the same degree of funding. The commitment is there and either the services or the partnership in some way will be sustained, because it's a great idea that you can go in from any door, but the door is closed on the other side. So you know there's that memory disorder and dementia and depression doors. But after you go in the door, there are no services. So yeah great. You figured out what I've got and then goodbye let dr rosenberg respond. Certainly I'm not a doctor by the way, but thank you the honorary title. I think that the air, the issue of sustainability and financing is one. I really have some expertise and knowledge about and most of what we're describing can be covered through people who are both uninsured, commercially insured, have medicaid and have medicare it's just being able to braid the pieces together. We'll need time to do that and to make a plea and a play for the kind of financing we need the kind of capitation sub capitation case rates. So if we can get three years, I think we can have this extended and paid for as part of health care, which is what it should be and how it should be paid for, but three years sounds so short, german interference, internal dementia and alzheimer's disease. We do have capacity. We have the center of essence for alzheimer's disease with a I call direct with that, dr honey and priscilla riviano, and we have in their social workers. We have those petitions and we do have capacity to serve this community, but not the depression side. Dr lente, that's true, it says no barrier come in through dementia come in through depression, but if you're depressed never mind, do you only press alone? They don't go to you, but if you only press on demented yes, we have capacity to look up. Okay, oh gosh, all right! Well, that's maybe a distinction that we can try to do without any other yeah curtis. I'm sorry go ahead, no problem! I you know, I see a correlation with public safety also as we talk about public health as we talk about public safety as a and the issues that we are facing now with noise pollution uptick in crime uptick in you know things like the uses of fireworks. I think some of these things. I know social science research, but I've. Obviously you know I have had experience with research and I do think that there could be a correlation between some of these byproducts of Covid-19 with some of the things we see in the community right now, and if we can make a case to say that well, these are also symptoms of cobit they're, not they're, not separated from Covid-19 right. What we're seeing in the community people hanging outside their apartments they've been locked up for three months. It doesn't make it right, but there's a lot of there's a lot of things that are happening in the community as a byproduct of our quarantine, our confinement, our mental instabilities and our complete, you know disregard for others. You know right now, so I do think that, as we dive deeper into this conversation of researching the impact of Covid-19 and the health additional health disparities, not just people of color dying at a higher rate than others, but looking at the disparities with their with the mental instabilities and the traumatic experiences that it has been has caused. So many and perhaps making that correlation with some of the crime increases. We've seen also could be good for us to make a stronger case to have more resources from you know the from the city to support some of the crime. You know some of the initiatives to diminish crime. You know curtis, you are spot on. I was on the phone actually this afternoon with sherlane mcrae. You know the mayor's wife, who is very committed to mental health as an issue, and she brought up the whole the whole really issue of safety. It hadn't been something we were discussing and she is thinking about it. So I think your idea of also aligning this with safety issues is a very good one. Thank you for that suggestion, and I love you I just want. I just want to say I just want to say for the record: I'm not opposed to people hanging out on the street, but when they're hanging out on the street after midnight, one two three in the morning and keep them keeping other people awake, who are their neighbors? That, I think, is beyond the pale. So people in our community people in our community are welcome to hang out on the street, but there are limits when it comes to affecting how other people can can he can survive in their own apartments and enjoy the use of their apartments daryl yeah, just from the chat line also, I just wanted to mention a few things that were said recently, someone pointing out another intersection at 204 and post avenue where that's been a problem. Also someone mentioning that talked before about you know how the mayor is no help. The police clearly aren't helping so the enforcement side, but this is clearly a mental health issue, as it relates specifically to the fireworks. So we're going to have a a further discussion, specifically about fireworks later on the agenda. Are we going to be able to? Are we going to be able to refer back to the chat after this meeting or does the chat disappear? Well, I think we're trying to say a lot of them on the record. So it's live, but I believe there's a way for paula to keep that right. I want to make sure that we're taking we're taking note of those locations yeah and then also I just there's a person named cruz. I see your question from before and we can talk about that in new business. Just apply for that all right, all right, okay, so somebody else from the from the group wanted to talk. I don't know if they can unmute right now. Are there any questions now, specifically on the columbia, mental health initiative, all right? Well, let's, let's move on then thank you. It is dr pinkus. Is it not? Yes, okay, thank you for having us, okay. Well, I'm hoping that we'll have an opportunity to sit down with you with a on some other occasion and with you and ms rosenberg, dr lantigua, with ross with sandra and go into further detail about the program and help you perhaps flesh it out and make it happen, and certainly if, if you're submitting applications for funding, let us know if we can provide any letters of support or do anything we can to be helpful thanks so much we really appreciate it all right. All right is are the do. We still have the ryan health center. Yes, we do. Yes, all right, very good, so michael you're, gonna, you're gonna handle the powerpoint and brian and samuel are gonna. Do the presentation that's correct, all right, very good, so I'm very happy by to welcome the ryan health center, the william f ryan community health center to washington heights. This is the ryan health center has a number of facilities began on the upper west side is also located on the lower west side and on the lower east side and is now venturing into washington heights to expand its. It has an excellent reputation for providing health care, and this is a very exciting development of to advance health care, the availability of health care to residents of washington heights in inwood. So I'm very happy to welcome you, so mr mcindoo you're, the president and ceo, and thank you so much for to come to washington heights you're welcome and it's our pleasure first. Let me just thank the health and environment committee for allowing us to do a presentation tonight. We are pretty excited about the site that we're going to be opening up in september before I go in I'd like to give a little background on ryan health, and before I do that, I know it was a question a minute ago. Basically, a federally quote: we are at federally qualified health center and what that means is we're. We are a community based healthcare provider that receives funding from the federal government to provide primary care services in underserved areas and part of part of that requirement of getting the dollars from the federal government is that we can never turn a patient away any patient that walks through our door doesn't matter whether they have insurance or not have insurance. They must be seen and I'll get into that in a second. That was our founding principle many years ago. So, as I mentioned, we have over 50 years of delivering high quality, affordable, comprehensive health services. So we are more than primary care. We have besides primary care, we have dental service vision services and we have a number of specialty services, also throughout the network, whether it's cardiology, podiatry dermatology, just to name a few. So we do provide a lot of specialty services besides the primary care services and we actually have residency internal medicine, residency programs that we also run throughout the network. As the chairman said, we are located in Manhattan, specifically from the lower east side. Currently we go as far north as harlem. We have two small sites in harlem and in hopefully within the next two months, we will be going further north up into washington heights inward area, but we do have 18 sites throughout the ryan network. We do have seven school-based health centers and we have four homeless shelters that we do the cert provide services for, and we also have a mobile health center and actually the mobile health center. Actually, this week was up in inwood providing services and what they're focusing on right now is doing antibody testing for covert 19.. So we were actually in inward on monday and yesterday didn't see that many patients, but we have to build it up, but we, but it's a start. I mentioned a little bit ago. Our founding principle is healthcare. Is a right, not a privilege- and this was first articulated by congressman william f ryan, who obviously we are named after and we live that every day and that goes back to every person that comes into the center needs to be treated with respect and dignity, and it doesn't matter race whether what kind of whether they have insurance or not, they should be treated with that dignity and respect that we all deserve. Okay, I have to stop you for a moment and provide a little more background, because there are some of us who remember congressman ryan with an enormous amount of respect, and we remember how he served our area. Washington, heights and inwards was part of his congressional district from 1961 to 1972. He was considered a like a conscience of the congress. He was one of the leading opponents of the vietnam war. He was an important advocate for civil rights. He was also a champion of the national park system by the way, but he was a very significant and important leading voice in congress and we were very proud to have ryan as our congressman and very proud to have a facility. Now, in our district named after him, yeah steve on a side note, his son is still involved to a degree. He lives down in washington, d.c he's an attorney, and actually we got a small check the other day because he's 40 years in one organization and the organization sent the william f ryan a check of five thousand dollars. I think we got it last week, so there's still a connection to the ryan family. Very good michael, can change the slide please so about a year and a half. Two years ago we conducted an external needs assessment because we were, we are in expansion mode, and we said you know we and we wanted to be go further north into Manhattan and the needs assessment found that the greatest need was in the washington heights in the inward area. Had the greatest unmet need for health care in Manhattan the rates of many diseases, you could see diabetes, cardiovascular cancer were disproportionately high from the rest of the city, and even hospitalizations relating to those diseases were also disproportionately high. So when we looked at it, it really popped out at us when we had the consultants come in and really look at it that this is an area that kind that fqhc should be. It should be in, so that we can provide the services that your community needs and, as I mentioned, average income is also 40 below the borough wide average in 2019. To just give you an idea, we did service over 50 000 patients throughout minute throughout new york city and about 70 of them had medicaid and or medicare, and about 12 were uninsured. So that gives you the idea that majority of our patients are either uninsured or underinsured, that we that we mainly provide services for so with that I'm gonna turn it over to sam bartels, who is the executive director of our west 97th street site set, which is the largest site throughout the network, and one of the any older site and sam has been taking the lead in setting up the operations of the new site. So sam, if you don't mind hi everyone. Thank you for having us. I'm gonna cover four areas: the location, the timing, which is the reopening and the details of the practice and the staffing. So we will be located on 1015, watchwood avenue right at the corner of 181st street and westwood. We considered many of many options and we chose this site as the as it was centrally located. We are preserving the building stock. Apparently this was an old attended community, so we are preserving the old theater with a long history in the community. It's also an easy access to public transportation, multiple bus lines, including the one which stops right in front of the center, and also one and eight subway lines nearby in terms of timing, we're anticipating finishing construction in august and begin seeing patients in september, pending department of health approval, which we already in the process of getting the c-o-n process of in the process of obtaining the c-o-n the center itself. We are really excited because this is our newest center and it's going to be seven exam rooms and around 2700 square feet by year. Two we expect to save nearly 3500 unique patients you're calling over fourteen thousand visits. The services will be adult medicine, servicing children, adults, seniors and, as part of the primary care are. We also gonna have behavior services which is available to those who need it. Specialty care will be added based on need. You know, based on patient, needs, staffing wise when we're fully operational, we're gonna have 18 staff at the center 11 or more of them will be 1199 seiu members, and we also made it a priority to make that make sure that we have bilingual staff at this center. It's also going to be one of our most high-tech, advanced and well. You know one of the most brand new center and gonna have self checking. You know electronic checking kiosks are we exploring online schedule and there are many amenities to make. Then all the patients for welcome and also make the ease of access much better for the patients, so steve we'd love to open up for discussions. As sam said, we are on target we're hoping to open by mid to late september, to have our opening to open up the site. One of the things that we were fortunate is during the covert cri. During the pandemic. We were considered essential services, so the construction was not delayed, they could continue constructing the facility, so that was helpful to keep things moving along as and on schedule. Oh, very good is it? Is it more than one floor? No, it's gonna! It's one floor really! Oh okay! So it's about 2700 square feet. Okay, I thought I thought I thought. Maybe the theater had a balcony or something is there a? What do you use you have to do? You have to have a backup hospital? Is there a backup hospital? Yes, we are working with presby to be to have the agreements in place. I think it's pretty far along right now to have the agreements in place, because that is one of the requirements that we have to have a backup hospital agreement. Yes and so you're expecting to use a presbytery. Yes, oh all, right, very good. All right are there any other questions from the committee members daryl. Do we have anything from the public? Well, we might yeah. Let me check, but I did have a couple questions were the was there any did you have any focus planned for the neighborhood? I know there's you know been a growing lgbtq community up here. I know you do a lot of that in your health kitchen branch and then also you know in terms of like family planning services, there's there's high higher numbers of teenage pregnancies in this neighborhood as well. So I just wonder if you had any you right now, we do daryl. We do a lot of community events and a lot of that is around lgbt. So we do a lot of that in the community. As I mentioned, we do have a mobile van that will be up in the community as needed. It can go anywhere in Manhattan and actually in the Bronx also can really anywhere in the city, but we focus on Manhattan, so we will do community events throughout once we're up there and we've all. We've actually talked to all the elected officials staff about how we can how we can be in the community and helping out and hopefully we'll get some feedback, and you know- and then we can. You know, as I said, be in the community as far as the family planning we right now, our family planning largest site is down in the upper west side. It's a very large family planning, women's, it's called orion health, women's and children's center, and one of the things that, in the beginning that we're going to be evaluating is what the needs are. So if that is one of the needs- and it sounds like it may be, we can we can pivot pretty quickly and tr and provide services as needed. We have seven exam rooms, so we can you know it's not us that which is a small site by standards, but we can pivot if that's a need and have a provider up there. That you know can provide those services, we're gonna, we're gonna be and sam mentioned earlier same thing: with specialists, we're gonna evaluate what the needs are and then, if the needs is for a certain specialty- and maybe it's one or two days a week, that's what we're going to be. That's what we would start to provide. So any input you have is definitely helpful to us all right. Any other questions I do. I just wanted to know if you are planning any special services for the older adults in the community betty. Do you want to identify yourself? So they know I work at isabella, which is 191st street and audubon avenue, and we provide a number of services in the community for older adults. One of the things that we do know is that there's a scarcity of mental health services and physical health services for the elderly. It's not easy to access for all of them, and I'm just wondering if you have any plans to focus on that particular population. I know you're planning on a as doing a survey, but I'm wondering if you have anything at least from the start along those lines, yeah actually two things. First, our primary care docs will be serving the elderly population as part of their. As you know, part of their services. We also are gonna, have a social worker at the site so that we will be able to provide some behavioral health services and again, as we see what the needs are, the community that or- and it sounds like from the presentation we heard earlier- that may be a significant need that we- and actually you know, brought that up to us with assembly woman. Yes, I'm sorry, dela rosa was quite adamant about the needs in that in the mental health services. So we so we can. We can pivot for lack of a better word to whatever the needs are again within our confines that we don't like. I said we only have seven exam rooms at this point all right. Anyone else, oh all, right, very good, all right, so I hope I assume, though, maybe there'll be an open house in september yeah we would michael. Yes, that's our plan steve, and we definitely want the community board to be present and we would definitely appreciate any help that the community board can provide in spreading the word about the opening of the center right. Well, you'll send us a flyer that we can send out. You know to our to our email list and circulate to others and make sure the word gets around. So again. We certainly welcome you to the community and we certainly want to be supportive and make sure that you succeed and because what you're doing is absolutely beneficial and a and a major plus for the community. So, thank you for thank you for making this investment in washington heights and edward. Yes, ms hertzberg. Yes, do you want to mention that your senior center is going to be located only a few blocks away from their health center? Would you thank you so much we're actually going to be at the intersection of audubon and 181st. They may not know the terrain yet, so maybe you want to tell them. That's like three blocks to the east yeah, not even three. It's really two blocks two blocks to the east: okay and we're already a very big established senior center in the area. So I think that we should get to know each other fantastic. Absolutely you know steve. One of our biggest hopes is that this will be so successful that we're going to be looking within the next couple years for another site in the area. Well, what I think there's room for a second floor, so maybe there was there was there was no. There was no balcony, no all right, but let me tell you something: well, you know by the time I was around in that neighborhood. It was a porn theater, so it shows you that I never went in there. Okay, thank you. Thank you again for having us. We appreciate it well, thank you for coming to washington heights and we look forward to a long relationship. Yes, thank you and appreciate your meetings and if presbyterian doesn't sign that backup agreement, let us know oh and our next, our next natalie. Do you have a comment? Natalie? Yes, no thank you for the presentation when you folks joined us at the president's office. To do this, we did discuss some local cbo's like the two senior centers. I just wanted to reiterate the women, the single women's shelter on audubon right there and the ps132 about a block from where you are setting up your shop now, which is a community renewal school that is high, need for both the students and the families there, also where I started my distinguished education back in 1970, so so please, it's a great neighborhood welcome count on us for support. Thank you. Thank you appreciate it all right, very good. All right, thank you, and our next speaker is actually from new york. Presbyterian hospital, the director of community affairs, julio batista, thank you, steve, I'd like to also echoes natalie's sentiment there and welcome the ryan senator to washington heights. It's it's a great community, and so thank you as much needed services there. So I'd just like to just like to mention that you know the hospital new york perspective remains focused on being ready, so readiness is really important. Part of this of our thinking, not sure whether in fact, we'll have a second resurgence coming up in the fall. Obviously, with you know, being the same time with the flu season, it's going to get pretty pretty intense. I believe, because you know a lot of people get the flu and think they're. You know they have Covid-19, so it is, it is going to be quite interesting time come the fall, so one of the things that I want to present here and I'm sorry if some of you already saw this is really we prove produce an a very brief close to four minute educational video around the use of telemedicine, telehealth and the reason we want to show it is because you know there's you know as we wanted people not to enter the hospital. We wanted to also give the opportunity to inform the community that you know they could still reach their doctors through their phones. So we think that that's going to be something that will continue. Our acn has seen from March 1st through the end of April, really double their intake with telemedicine. They had over 40 000 calls on telemedicine, so we thought that is important for us to produce and disseminate as wide as we can a video that would at least educate our community around telling that health. So if you bear with me for a second, I want to be able to just show that, to you tell me one more time: what was the parade that in which the acn had a double its normal intake, so that was that was from March 1st through may 31st, okay yeah. So I don't know if anybody can see this. My the screen. Yes, okay! So it's a very short video all right all right! We need the sound, oh sure you might have to adjust the audio settings on your side. I'm sorry yeah! We! I don't think we can hear the video. You don't hear the audio! No, do you hear that off? No, we can see. We can read sure what I this is actually both in english and spanish. So what I'll do is I'll email that to stephen paola, and maybe you could submit that to committee members and folks who are also here on the line. You can also put it on the questions and answers, so other people outside they can get it through. That link like the people that are not panelists, can get it now through there as well. Okay, yeah, thank you julio can do that from his end, yeah, okay and also julia. You can try doing it again. If you want, you can stop the video and kind of like relaunch it and see if it gets you an option, because if we can hear you through the laptop, then it has to be your video, like the actual vimeo, has to be shooted, because we can hear you okay, I don't know if you are able to see it there yeah you can see. Can you hear it? No? Not yet. Can you hear it on your side? Hold it yeah. I just took it off, so I can't hear it, but but for some reason I'm not sure why you couldn't hear it: okay, all right so oops. So what I'll do is I'll? Can you hear me yeah? If we come here, we can hear you yeah okay, so what I'll do is I'll share the video with everyone and I'll also make sure that you know we'll send the english and spanish versions, just in case you wanna with some others. Okay, we can we can. We can try to show it again in september sure- and I think you know the purpose of really was to generate start- that discussion around it. So we will be more than happy to have dr mingus come to the september meeting and provide a little more information around telehealth, and what are we doing around encouraging people to actually use it all right, all right, so we'll mark that down for september as well sure- and my and my apologies- I don't not don't know what happened. You can't get the sound yeah all right. Well, we'd rather have dr dominguez in person anyway. Okay, all right, do you have you have more to the report? Well, that that's really the you know just want to be able to show that video wanted to emphasize the fact that you know we need to get as a community and as a hospital be ready in case. There is a second surge and you know we're obviously getting you know doing all we can to ensure that the hospital is ready. Should that happen all right yeah. What were you were able to get some of the statistics that I requested or not well right now, in terms of kovit, you know, then, the stats that we have is really within our hospital up in northern mahan, which allen tony and, of course, the hospital we do have 4 74 inpatient Covid-19. Currently, so those numbers are, you know continuing to go down. So that's the number that we have right now is 74 patients 74 in tony milstein, and up at allen correct, that's a combination of all three right: yeah, okay, all righty steve! Do you mind if I just add something to what julio's saying, but mr fromer? Yes, thank you. Obviously, working with the hospital telemedicine has been a huge portion, a part of what we've been doing over the last four months. Prior to March 1st. There were significant legal and regulatory barriers on both the federal and state level to widespread use of telemedicine, either through legislation or through emergency declarations on the federal or state level. A lot of those barriers were lowered, thus enabling the growth of telemedicine- and I think, that's one area where we're not going back from the you know. The telemedicine is here to stay. There, you've seen the tremendous benefits from it, but one of the challenges is to make some of these. The advances that we've made in terms of lowering these regulatory barriers extend beyond the emergency, whether it's something called you know, site, origin or payment, or even licensing issues. One of the things we've learned in telemedicine for jurisdictional purposes. It doesn't matter where the practice where the where the doctor is it's where the patient is so the doctor could be in new york, fully qualified fantastic in his or her field. If the patient happens to be in pennsylvania during the telemedicine visit that doctor can be accused of practicing without a license in pennsylvania, even though the doctor never set foot in pennsylvania, so what's one of the great you know sort of regulatory challenges that we need? I mean we at the medical center, while most of our patients come from new york. We do get a large chunk of patients from new jersey and connecticut. It's a big issue for student health colleges. People who grew up in new york students may go to school out of state. Without this issue they can't have continuity of care. So just you know adding to what julio said. One of the policy challenges that we have over the next couple of months is creating a playing field. If you will reducing these regulatory barriers to the increase increased due to telemedicine, because everything right now is on an emergency basis, and we need to extend that beyond the emergency again just to be clear too, because you use the example of someone from pennsylvania. Are you talking about a pennsylvania resident or a new yorker who's? Just in the poconos does it matter no, like? Is there a difference? No, so one thing that scenario most people say that one visit sort of emergency phone call is not going to cause you a problem, but any sort of extended, continuous care. You have that second phone call, you are, you are risking being accused of practicing without a license and it does not matter whether you're, whether the patient lives in pennsylvania or just happens to be visiting relatives for the weekend in college in pennsylvania, the jurisdiction for licensing purposes depends on where the patient is physically located, not where the practitioner is physically located. Do you have to take special precautions to make sure that nobody on the outside can like hack into the call and and protect the privacy of the patient and absolutely and the systems that we and your presbyterian uses are fully compliant fully hyper-compliant and your privacy is protected yeah? In fact, you know one of the. I was overheard one of our faculty members. The biggest challenges that we face is not the technological challenges but the physical challenges. He saw a patient who decided to take the session from trader joe's, so the patient was in a public setting during this telemedicine visit, and that was the risk to the breach of privacy, not anything having to do with the their technology in the works. So there's a number of things that would go on. First of all, one of the things that the legislation the government has already done is included audio only in telemedicine which wasn't before you can now. Prior to this, a telemedicine visit had to be video and they're just they're, a number of folks who, frankly, don't have that technological base capability governor signed legislation allowing for audio only televisions. We suspect that, over the next couple of months, you're going to see an effort in washington on the federal level we're starting to have some conversations with folks in albany about it as well again, this licensing issue is one: that's probably needs to be handled on a state level. The issues of payment and these companies call site. Origin is more of a federal issue, all right sally. You have a question or a comment yeah. My question with telemedicine is: how do the reimbursement rates for medicare differ for an office visit like a new office visit, that is telemedicine versus in person and also for commercial insurance? What's the difference in billing, so I I'm not an expert on this so take my answer, as you should always take my answers with a grain of salt but, as I understand it, prior to March, first or roughly March. First, the reimbursement for telemedicine was either non-existent right or significantly less than an in-person visit. One of the when I talk about the regulatory release is now because of these emergency declarations, often time the reimbursement is on par with an in-person visit and again that is one of the things we would. We would like to be seeing if a physician or a doctor or a nurse is providing 15 minutes worth of or half an hour's worth of mental health counseling, which in person or on the phone the reimbursement should be, should be the same. There certainly should be no dis financial disincentive to using telemedicine. It was mentioned you've seen I saw on the screen in the video. There are tremendous advantages to using telemedicine and we certainly don't want to provide a financial disincentive to do so, but that's one of the things sally which has been covered by these these emergency regulations for lack of a better term great. Thank you all right, any other questions. Now, all right. Let's proceed to the report from the isabella geriatric center betty. I did have a question not on telemedicine. Well, go ahead! Yeah! Could you provide an update on what's going on and alan? I know we're going to hear from the nurses later, but we would like to hear from your perspective and also the loss of 50 beds in Brooklyn methodist. I know that that's not in our geographic area, but that is capacity that it's been lost. So if you could just update us on inpatient capacity well, I can speak to the to the island and again I think that you know I'll repeat what we mentioned. The last time is that we don't we don't know what the future holds. You know so when the surge originally occurred, that psych unit was closed. Patients that needed to be serviced were sent down to gracie square, which is a hospital on 7th street which is affiliated with us. At this point you know we, as I mentioned, continue to stand. You know just getting ready, there's a second surge, so there is no to monster to this point, to be able to put that psych unit back to what it was in the near future until we figure out what's going to happen in the future with corvette, and what is it? Are you able to handle the capacity at gracie square? What is your census now at gracie square? Well, I don't have the census figures, but I can certainly you know, be able to get that and share with you yeah, but I just like to add that, in addition to gracie square, you know we do have you know the westchester division. We do have a wide range of different locations where patients can also be served so, but I'll get you the senses in terms of you know what it is at gracie square. Perfect. Thank you. Well, it is a matter of concern that the inpatient capacity is continuing to decline throughout the system and it would be useful to know what the situation is at gracie square but, as you know, julio, it's not acceptable to us that this unit is closed and we have no idea when it will ever reopen. I understand I understand those concerns steve, but I think at the same token, I think we also have to understand that we don't know what's going to happen. You know come september, October together when that times comes we'll have a better understanding. I know, but you still, you still have the field hospital. You still have. You know, and there are ever every other unit that was moved out of allen has been returned, and it's strange that this is the one unit that is still in limbo, and we have no idea if and when it will ever come back, and it's disturbing to me that the hospital doesn't at least say that at some point it will definitely come back. It just seems to be. You know an amorphous situation, all right, betty lehmann report from isabella hold it. We have two hands whose hands are these? Oh chris? Did you want to say something chris crane? Are you with us? I don't think they can talk. Steve is the problem. We don't. He should be a panelist, oh okay, then maybe paula could promote him, and so ken daryl and steve you guys all that when you catch them, just swing them over and promote them to panelists, because they were not on the list of names that steve gave me earlier. Oh what like, if you guys, recognize the names? Well, he if he, if he's raging hello, he's on now chris I'm one of the psych nurses at the allen hospital hello. Can you speak up a little hello? I'm christopher trent, I'm one of the allen. Psych nurses and I was one of the nurses that was sent to actually gracie square to handle the clothing situation so I'll be talking about that more. But I heard you guys talking about you know the nurses moving to gracie square yeah. I was sent down to grace square. I was on place on the Covid-19 unit, so I believe like hello, can you hear me? I don't know what. Why is the volume so low payola hello? Can you hear me now? Yes, that's nothing that I can control, that's the device that the person is calling and, unfortunately, yeah. I cannot fix that. I can only fix the volume for the person. Speaking. Can you guys hear me now? Yes, oh yeah, very good yeah, I'm sorry about that. It must have kicked into bluetooth yeah. My name is christopher one of the psych nurses from the allen hospital. I was there for about 12 years I'll be talking about it further, but I was moved from allen hospital to gracie square and I was placed on the Covid-19 unit for a while. You know at max capacity when I was at grace square. We had about 16 patients, I was there and then they. Finally, you know they teetered down to zero. You know I was, I was floating back and forth from throughout the floors of gracie. It was an interesting experience to help out with you know, gracie and stuff, but yeah. We were just randomly moved out closed out. Either allen asked to move out within a week to gracie, which was you know, not most convenient, but I'm sorry you're saying the number of psych patients were was reduced to zero. Well, the Covid-19 patients went from probably 16. They had a whole four, oh wow, it was. It was started off. You know maybe two three four and then it went up to 16 max and it's trended slowly down to zero, but how many? How many site patients were at gracie square? Greasy squares fully psyched, so it was all site patients and how many would that be I'd say they have maybe about like 25 per floor, but they had four floors. However, they closed one floor. I can speak to this too. Yes, if it's all right, if I bought in my name's alana, I'm also a nurse on three river east at the allen hospital. I was also put in gracie square right now. I've been speaking to several nurses, who are still at gracie square, are four floors. Three of the floor of three of the floors are open. One of them has been closed seemingly indefinitely. We initially heard July now we're hearing september that, in addition to the two methodist units, closed down and, of course, alan, but what the other concerning piece here is that, since Covid-19 is still an active threat, you can't have as many patients on a unit. You can't have full census on a unit. So even if there are 30 beds on a unit, some rooms can only that used to house two patients can only have one patient. So if you can put them six feet apart, you can have two patients in that room, but now the issue is that we have way more single rooms just out of safety precautions, so there's far fewer single beds or worse. But a lot of my concern would be whether or not the you know it was. It was down to maybe 22 or 25 beds at allen had one most recently, whether or not the people who would normally be served at allen are now being. Are they in fact, at least now being accommodated at gracie square? Are those 22 25 patients, at least half of whom? Maybe more are coming from northern Manhattan. Are they now at least being served at gracie square or are they being sent elsewhere? They're actually gracie square, since they are standalone. Psych hospital has the ability to deny patients access, whereas at nyp as a full hospital. I believe, like article 31 hospital, you can't turn patients away unless you really don't have the capacity, but they can based on any status they choose. So my answer is like I have seen when we were at gracie still. I have seen our patients there, but we had to discharge our patients very quickly in mid-march, and so I do think that there's a significant portion of the patients that we would normally see who aren't getting help at all and have nowhere to go and that overflow usually goes to shelters, we're seeing much more people in the streets and living in the subways and we're also seeing from this is anecdotal. This last part, but from my friends who work in corrections, we are seeing an increase in people with mental illness being sent to corrections as the overflow. Well: okay, as long as we have the two of you on board at this point, betty I'm gonna push you off for another few minutes, so alana and chris, do you have anything more that you wanted to tell us about the situation with the allen psych unit and also julia's on the call? Okay, but julia doesn't want to speak yeah. I don't need to speak the nurses or speak thanks I'll, be here right. So should I give a brief history? Should I start? Should we start our? No, we no, we know the history there might be. There might be people on the call that could actually find that useful. Okay, all right, okay, I'm okay, you're right, you're right! I take it back, no problem, so my name is chris. I'm one of the nurses here at the allen hospital I've been a psych nurse at the allen for about eight years, all together, 12 years, you know, allen, haas, allen. Hospital psych unit is called three river east. We are adult inpatient. Psychiatry with 30 beds is slowly trended down because one they couldn't find doctors to provide coverage and that's the reason why they kind of downgrade from 30 down to 22 and slowly I mean nobody wants to work at a place that you know, nyp is trying to close, so they've been having hard time hiring doctors, I feel so. A majority of the patients come from this community. They live in that live in inward. They live in upper Manhattan. They live around the hospital. A lot of them come from underprivileged. You know little to no income they're homeless, they have medicaid, they live in the underserved areas, so they need that support and mental health services. You know in 2018 we came to you guys. You guys definitely helped us. The community board definitely helped us in supporting the unit getting it stopped. From closing we unanimous the unanimously vote helped out tremendously. We came together with politicians, the community, the community board and it ultimately worked for preventing from the the allen hospital from closing and it was victorious up until you know so now now I believe the hospital you know cove is very important. I believe. Yes, we had to do our part we all at. As psych nurses, we are nurses first, but you know we want to support kovid. We want to help out as much as possible. We willingly went to gracie square to help out for the you know. We want to help our people as much as we can definitely, but they said we'll come back in may they promise us may we'll come back to allen hospital we'll take care of our patients. However, now it's a different story. They say you know they don't know when they might open a med, surg psych unit and the unit right now is completely empty and rearranged so that they cannot have psych patients in that unit. They have too much literature risks. I believe lana is going to talk a little bit more about the current situation. I'm sorry. What was the last thing? You said too much what I believe alana is going to continue things in the room that they could use to hang themselves. Yes, like you know, like they installed oxygen vacuums iv, poles even yeah, every poles they installed cameras in the rooms I mean the unit is completely different: it's not safe for them to put patients there I mean they could definitely self-harm. They could definitely injure themselves with the new equipment that they did install in there. What was the word that you used? Literature- ligature, oh ligatures, oh okay! Yes, sir! Okay! Yes, all right! All right, I'm sorry! Alana did you want to continue sure yeah. So I just. I also wanted to emphasize the fact that the psychiatric nurses were taking care of Covid-19 patients. While we were at gracie square and that's important, because now gracie square refuses to take Covid-19 patients and they are allowed to do that. So there are very few centers located within a hospital that will accept Covid-19, psych patients, so instead they end up going to general med surg floors and often they could really benefit from frankly, a psychiatric unit inside a medical facility. So chris went over, we were switched abruptly to gracie square in mid-march brought back in may, and so they have decided to transition our staff to medical surgical nurses. We were told that all of psych within our cluster, which includes all the psych nurses at 168th street, would be undergoing this training. I've checked in with at least a half dozen nurses from nine garden north, which is the psychiatric unit. That's the only one. That's been kept open at cumc and none of them know about this cross training and they're not currently doing it. So our concern is that this is really presbyterian trying to permanently close our unit. Well, and we know now there is a mental health crisis. Without a doubt, we had a major suicide within our own hospital system. Dr lorna breen, it's just unimaginable, especially now that unit lays completely empty. I mean somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't I have. I was told by several sources that unit was never at capacity and the field hospital was never at capacity. So what I'm getting? What I'm getting to is? We are currently being transitioned to med surg. All per diem nurses currently are out of work, so these are nurses that have been working for 30 plus years as psychiatric nurses. Some of them have disabilities that make it very difficult for them to do that work and they are now being transitioned into med surg with messages from presbyterian that are essentially, we don't know and normally under normal circumstances. Presbyterian needs to go through a regulatory process with the department of health and the office of mental health to close down a psychiatric unit, but some executive orders by Cuomo and the metrics to reopen new york state have made it so that psychiatric hospitals, not just in the city but all over the state, are closing down their units. So, and this is also, let me just add- I am not even sure if cornell's psychiatric unit is open, yet they're non-unions. So we don't get to know about that like we, don't really hear much about that, but so keep that in mind and then keep in mind that the psychiatric units that are open are going to be at three-fourths or half capacity. Just to begin with, so we're not sure, what's going to happen, but we are really concerned for our patients pop our patient population. As we know they are predominantly homeless on medicaid, some of them are uninsured, so the unit may not be profitable for that reason, but those people may be uninsured because they are not able to advocate for themselves. So it's predominantly a unit run by people of color for people of color with serious mental illness and substance use disorders. Many of them have legal histories already, and so we don't know what's happening to them. We're trying I'm really trying desperately to track where the overflow is going and that's proven really difficult. But what I can tell you is that people are suffering and that unit is empty. Well, that is pretty disturbing and- and I I've been asking this question all along- I couldn't understand how they could just close the unit without going through the regular article 28 process. So what you're saying and maybe julia you'll be looking into this further- is that the governor has issued an executive order that allows psych hospitals to close. Not quite so, it is there's an executive order 202.10, so the executive order released his liability during the period of Covid-19 for major hospital systems to do what they see essentially see fit to control Covid-19 and the metrics to reopen the state mandate that there needs to be a 30 percent excess capacity. I'm sorry 30 at the excess capacity in case of this next surge, and those in case of we do anticipate a next surge, but is it going to be worse than the one that we faced? First? Traditionally, that's not how it works, especially with the measures that governor Cuomo has taken. So here we are stuck in this bind where they have been are able to get around these regulatory agencies, and we actually have been working with elected officials to try and garner support for our patients. Well, I think that may be the key to this, because we could you would you're gonna need you're gonna need to have the elected officials pushing to get this thing done and to get to get the psych unit restored to the hospital steve. What it is it's a de facto closure. It's a whole lot easier to roll on reopening than it is to close and all the excess capacity that is demanded is being held by shedding psych units instead of everybody every unit taking their fair share. It's close down the 25 here you know close down. 25 of Brooklyn methodist have another 25 that are shut down because they're going to remodel. I mean it's outrageous. What's going on yeah all right, I so steve. I just wanted to add something since we're very concerned that the psych unit is not going to be opened up again. We started reaching out, of course, to cb12. We've started reaching out to our elected officials who are covering their presbyterian, and actually we already had a virtual visit with senator jackson and today, right before we got on this meeting, I received the letter that we requested from senator jackson's office, demanding it's a letter to new york, presbyterian that they've delivered to new york presbyterian and it's demanding to open the allen psych unit which, with the same concerns that we have, and if I may just share the screen, I wanted I actually emailed it to you. Steve, oh no, I cannot share my screen when did when did you send it to me right when I got it from senator jackson's office? Maybe around 6 30ish? Your meeting was already going on yeah, so it should be in your email, okay, I'm going to talk to our board chair, eliozar bueno and see whether he would be willing to do us a letter as well. I mean, I think, based on the fact that we've already done a resolution that this community board has already taken a position. I don't know that we would have to. I would hope we we what we wouldn't have to wait till september to take to do another resolution. I think we have the basis for doing our own to doing a follow-up letter ourselves steve I just wanted to let you know. Can you hear me I just want to let you know that senator jackson's representative is actually in the other part in attendees. It needs to be moved back over to panel okay, just in case they wanted to comment about that because the name came up. I thought I saw him as a panelist. Christian came off and when they logged off and logged back in that happened, hi folks, sorry about that, okay, yeah! I just briefly echoing what julia said. Our office bottom lined the drafting of the letter in collaboration with nicena and several members weighed in on the language, and we garnered signatures from the borough president from assemblyman taylor and from councilman rodriguez, and we sent the letter to dr corin this afternoon right before your meeting began. So we hope to have a response by the end of July. We've basically said we know, time is of the essence, and you know we expect to hear back about a date for reopening the unit by July 31st. I believe well, chris, I think that's great, but I would suggest that you also do a send that letter and address it to the state health commissioner and the state, the commissioner of mental health, because yes, they've been in touch. We need them to weigh in. I don't think they haven't yeah with all due respect. I don't know that dr colwin is is going to be somebody who can be easily persuaded on this question and I think the state needs to realize the ramifications of that executive order. I agree and we plan to follow up with them about this letter. We have a good contact with them. Since senator jackson took office in January of 2019, we've been in touch with both omh and doh. So they're aware that our eyes, the whole community's eyes really are on this facility, all right, very good, all right. So, let's work on this. Let's work on this together, all right, very good, very bad yeah, oh yeah! Well, that too yes, very bad, all right, so julia alana! Chris, do you have any last words I just want to say. I know that our census sounded low. There was a period of time where there was a hiring freeze on our floor, and so we did. There were several times where we were thinking. We were told as rns that our census was going to go back up to where it was, but that unfortunately never happened. But that being said, we discharged 700 over 700 people a year. What was that word charted discharge? We discharged over 700 people a year and, of course, part of safe discharge planning is to give them a safe discharge plan back into the community, but those you know there are some people who come back, but for the most part that gives you an idea of how many people, our small unit, helps every year right. All right! That's! Yes! Thank you! That's a good! That's a good number, all right all right! Thank you! Thank you to the three of you and julia. I want to be in touch with you on this all right. Thank you. Thank you, steve for giving us the time in this meeting. Thank you to the rest of the committee. Thank you very much. All right talk to you talk to you soon, betty betty. Are you still with us? I am yes. Can you, okay, we're up to you now report on isabella? Okay, all right, a couple of things to say. First of all, as of a couple of days ago, isabella is a covert free facility. Nobody has Covid-19 within our facility, all staff members are tested, according to the governor's executive order. Every week and every day that you come into the facility you're tested for temperature and you're asked a battery of questions, but then every week you need to be tested for Covid-19. We are permitting window visits for our residents. So what happens is that the family will call our the social worker and we will arrange a time when we can bring the resident downstairs. We have a variety of windows in the front and the back of the facility, and we can arrange a window visit and, of course, the audio capacity for people to be able to hear one another. There has been some changes this week with the federal on the state level permit in-person visits, but in order to qualify for that a facility as of July 15th, the facility has to be 28 days covered free and then they can set up or follow the parameters for in-person visiting. We just started to be a covert free facility, so we're in the start of that cycle and if all goes well sometime within the next three and a half weeks, we should be able to provide in-person visits, which will be very important since there have been no in-person visits since March 12th. We all we provide phone calls and video chats through our recreation therapy department, so that residents can remain in touch with your family and friends throughout the day. With regard to PPE, we have a sufficient amount. However, new york city is no longer providing PPE to nursing homes, so we have to go out on the market and continue to buy it from our various vendors. With that in mind, I will bring up the fact that this particular whole episode of Covid-19 has been financially devastating to isabella our unreimbursed expenses, total 4.6 million dollars, it's a lot of money, and we are appealing to the federal government for some support. But of course you know that that's a work in progress and who knows where that'll go. I need to say that, on top of that, the state had cut medicaid reimbursement by one and a half percent as an early part of this year and since 86 of our residents are on medicaid, that's quite a hit. That's another one million dollars on top of the 4.6 million, so we are financially in a very difficult situation at the moment. The good news is that our staff and our residents are covered free and that's really important, and you know it's been a very difficult period of time. Just to let you know, we also have communication for families. New york, as I mentioned in one of my earlier meetings, new york state has a website where you can see. You know if you want statistics on what happened at isabella and all of the facilities with the new york state, you can check the near the new york state department of health and they have those statistics, so we provide all of that. We also have phone numbers for family members to call in and speak to a social worker, 24, 7. and or not 24 7., I'm sorry to five. Seven days a week and get information with regard to a loved one, so it's available and we also have. We only have social workers answering the phone, so it's all hipaa protected and we're able to get information on that individual for that family member and get back to them right away. And what am I missing here? Pretty much it's by the it's a bilingual helpline or hotline, if you will for the family and that's it for now, that's all I have to report at the moment. Anyone have questions. Did you ever get the the written report from the state health department on the inspection they did at isabella? No, I know they've been in many times and not just isabella they've been in all of the nursing homes very a lot, because they want to make sure that all nursing homes are compliant with the governor's mandate for testing etc. I know all of our residents were tested, etc. You know weeks and weeks ago, and we continue to maintain that I know I haven't gotten any written report from them all right, because you know the new york times did an article back in early June that seemed to refer to as though they had seen the report I haven't. I haven't seen anything I'm working from home, so I'm not in the facility all right all right, I'll, follow up with you some more on that later. Okay, all right, any questions for betty all right, very good daryl. Are you checking the q a daryl yeah? Are we ready for new business, or are we no but we're going to talk about the firework? Yeah? Yes yeah, but it says it said we had 23 questions, that's right! They keep I'm not deleting them all. Okay, all right, very good, all right and a lot of them yeah. We answer in real time, so all right, very good, all right. So there are no questions, then, for betty, okay, we're up to the discussion about fireworks. Hopefully we won't have too many fireworks about fireworks, but this is. This is a really persistent issue in our community. It's a went on for weeks before and even after July, the 4th and tanya. Do you want to lead off the discussion I mean yeah. I helped to moderate this facebook group about just noise in general noise pollution in general in our community. You know we started out back in late may. We only had you know we have we had less than 100 people and then, when the fireworks started it ballooned. We now have 500 just about 500 members of this group. The fireworks have been going on. Where did steve go? Is he still here? Oh sorry, I didn't see you, though the fireworks have been going on for forever. I mean literally starting and right around the time of the protests. The george floyd protest. That's when I would. I would not connect the two of those things I don't. I don't think one has anything to do with the other. I do but we'll get to that later. Oh, but okay, so for the purposes of this introduction, so it started around that time around early June and it's every night every night. Every single night week, weekdays weekends, like literally people, were not getting sleep, it's just it's just unbelievable and the problem has been again when we bring this issue up. People say: well, you know it's just the culture of the community or let people get to get it out of their system. That came up at our last general board meeting. Oh, let them get it out their system. I'm like I was locked up too for three months. You know just like everybody else and stay at home, and I didn't go out and my first reaction after we were able to kind of venture out a little bit more wasn't to go out and light fireworks every night like it just like, really that what does that have to do with anything? So literally it's just unlivable. I mean it's and for me it's not just about fireworks. It is a persistent problem of just general disrespect for each for people in this community who don't respect other people, it's about just noise pollution in general, and I have been dealing with this for 14 years since I moved here, I have been contacting every all the elected officials going to the 33rd precinct talking to everybody there from the captain down about this issue going to the community of the police precinct community council meetings bringing this up and you get nowhere. You get anywhere. I think it's been worse this year than than I can recall in right. The fireworks the fireworks were definitely worse this year, and but no one did anything about it. We were allowed to live in terror, and that is unacceptable, and I all these elected officials, shame on them for allowing this community to live in and to live like that, and no one doing anything about it. Shame on the police that allow this to continue. Shame on the mayor's office. Anybody that allowed this to continue all of the elected officials. Anybody allowed us to continue to live like that is shameful and I don't know you know, and I want answers. Why were people allowed to? Why are people allowed to be terrorized like that? I had people contacting me because of my relationship with that facebook group saying I'm having mental stress my dog, my cat, my dogs are stressed out and peeing all over the floor and everything I'm I don't feel. Well, I'm not getting sleep and I'm not feeling. Well, I wasn't getting sleep either right now. This is not even my apartment. I am not even living in my own apartment that I pay rent for, because ignorant people choose to do what they do and no one does anything about it and it needs to stop it's unacceptable. I'm tired of talking about this- and this is- I think this is a build up steve. I really do it's not. Yes. This year was worse, but I think when you, this stuff has been building up and building up and allowing to be this way for a long time for those of us who live on certain parts of this community. This has been a constant problem just because it's now reaching out to other parts of the community because whatever was going on there- and I have my own theories, but this has been going on. I've been living with this type of nonsense since I've been here and what the response I get even from people on this board is. This is a community. This is what we, how we live, go away, shut up deal with it. What kind of nonsense is that- and I want answers from these elected officials that allowed us to live in terror- did nothing about any of this. Allow people to live this way, they're going to pay my rent the place. I can't even live all right, I'm sorry steve, but this is ridiculous. This has been going on for too long and I'm over it. You don't even know how many 311 complaints I have logged over the years that no one does anything about the police looks at it closes it up two seconds. I have to open it up and they don't even bother to do anything about it and then you have people say: oh well, don't call the police, don't call this wait, I'm. What are we supposed to do right? We, they were told us to call 9-1-1 at first when we were calling about fireworks, they say call 9-1-1 right, see, I'm sorry. I just said a few things and I have things to say about this too, but I'm going to say I'm going to save that for later, but I just want to point out a few things in the chat: don't save it for too long. Okay, some folks specifically pointing out again 161st street 214th street and seaman avenue tanya. Can you say what the name of the facebook group is? Some folks want to join that you're muted? What how could she be muted, yeah I'd? Do it to myself too believe it or not? Okay, the group is, is called wahi and inwood for respectful decibel levels, wahi and inwood for respectable, respectful decibel levels, and I can't because I can't share anything in the chat or anything so I'm gonna yeah people will have to just find us that way, but yeah and I had a question for you from me because I know where I live. I had it, like. You said early June through July, 4th it kind of stopped. I hear like one, you know, maybe at 11 or midnight, and it's nowhere near what it was, but has it slowed down on where you are or I mean it still occurs. I mean it definitely to me it felt like it slowed a little bit, but it still there was still fireworks going on and people are still reporting fireworks and I'm still seeing some firework activity. It's not like it was, I would say it's not like it was in June and up through, like you said, through July, for July 4th, but it's definitely the problem. My issue is: why was this allowed to go on? Why were we allowed to live like this? It's too bad curtis isn't still on, but, and maybe someone else knows, I know folks talk about the precincts and the community councils. What about fdny? Are they not involved in this? At all? Have they fdny? We were given a hotline number to call fdny to report fireworks. It was like one guy and he said all he's doing it's just doing the same thing. We could do it's just telling the police. Well, I think fdmy is involved because there's been two fires in inwood and I know there was one day in the park when there were four fires, but he's talking about to be involved in solving the problem and us to report. Not you know, have we had fires, sure and even with those fires, nobody did anything somebody's house burned down. Nobody did anything. What was that second fire, which I think was on sickle street, was that was that caused by fireworks? I don't think it was a whole apartment burned down on naval avenue. No, I know the one on the back steve. I don't think the report has been issued. Yet I haven't heard an update, that's correct. It is likely fireworks the one that was on saint nicholas in the 180s, but it it is not yet determined, but I'm sorry so natalie. There was also one on nago and sickles. So in addition to the one on nagel indictment, I think there's one near sickle street one night like natalie. Are you saying there was a fire on saint nicholas that was also caused by fireworks. That was also likely caused by fireworks at around the same time as the one on nagel say, nicholas at 180th street, and I think, between 186th and 187th I'll get you the email from fabrizio from fdny. Thank you steve. Can we let some of the people who are on the community like tell their own experiences, because I can't speak for everybody. Can we open up and unmute people, so they can talk absolutely so I mean I don't know how to do that, but we should do that. I it doesn't show me how to unmute them all right. I don't know you would have to go. Whoever's gonna monitor this daryl. Whoever has to go, buy the list down the numbers and ask them. You know give them the permission to talk. You cannot set them off all at once. Oh so I can give people permission to talk yeah like, for instance, you can say six nine, four, the number ending in six nine, four, I'm gonna give you permission to talk now, and so you hit allowed to talk and that person- oh okay, I see user 694. Are you on the call 694 yeah cell phone ending in 694? Are you on the call? Yes? I am, do you have any questions regarding fireworks? No, I'm just I'm one nurse from free river east. That was us listening on the call! Well, I don't even know the best thing to do in this situation is: go through the q. A these people have access to the q a so. They indeed have a question once you speak, they can go through the q a and then we can switch them off. There was somebody with phone number, five, two five that wanted to talk and wanted to say something for a long time can we get here? I just I just put them in five times right good. So, yes, it's me mcdalia see tanya. I know everybody here on the line. Actually I don't know what's going to be done about the noise in this community, but it's just really out of control, and this is something that we all said over and over and over and over and over again, where are the elected officials common de la rosa, the donnie rodriguez, when they want to go in somebody's pocket to get money? And I'm not talking about that? I'm going to talk about idoni. He wants to get in people's pockets to get money for his campaign this and that in the third he calls the press, the restaurants. He puts him on the on the pedophile, but when it comes to these kind of community concerns, where is he listening in action coming to the hosa? Where are you we need you now to help us navigate this nonsense that we go through like it's? I don't understand people that are working for us. We paying our tax hard earning money, 34 precinct 33rd. Where are these people where and what is the community board going to do to help us? We need help like this is serious out here. It's all free for all. We do with the hell we want. When we want rebels right up and down up and down they, I'm surprised they haven't, killed anybody, but just you know the stress of all this crap. What are we? How are they going to help us why they are not on this call, that's what I like to know all right. We also have bernard grobman, yes, tom yeah. I feel you. I totally agree with you tanya, that's like I mean you know. Really I just if I were on there. I would have said exactly the same stuff tonight. I actually had some success. I called up the nco for my sector over here in 33rd precinct and he actually showed up and he shut down two guys with blasting stereos out on the streets. He actually did it, but he did tell me that they have no teeth to what they do. In other words, all they can do is tell the guy to turn it down. They cannot tell anybody to move along. No, you can't give them a ticket if they don't move along yeah. They can't do any of that and those are orders from city hall. It has nothing to do with anybody else, other than city hall, and we are the only people who can change that yeah, because we vote for these guys and it's I mean I moved into this neighborhood last year, and I knew it was a little bit noisy and stuff. You know I got that, but my block was fairly okay. This year I went through a giant huge two block parties on my block. I had it in stereo till 3 30 in the morning at yankee stadium volume, I'm a guitar player. I do that for a living, I've never been on stage with volume like that. My building is built. It's a brand new building, it's built like an office building as far as noise control goes and it sounded like it was in my apartment. That's what was going on and every call to 311 got closed out in two seconds. I mean I have a list of them. You know I sent him to curtis and he was like this huge long list and finally, I got in touch with the nco and he was pretty cool, but he told me there's only certain amount of stuff that they're allowed to do and I think it's ridiculous they're I mean it's even a Covid-19 hazard. These people were hanging out with no masks hugging and everything else with no masks all next to each other. All night long they can close down a restaurant, that's going to pay taxes, but they can't close down this illegal crap on the street exactly and yeah, and they are breaking those laws- okay and tanya. If I could just say to you to one of your earlier points too, and just so people know this, there are members of the board. Yes said this is just noise who's who suggested? Why? Don't you go up to the people, lighting, the fireworks and say? Am I not doing that? It's ridiculous, and so I was at a no. We had we had I'm sorry. We had a board member at the last meeting. Who said why? Don't we just let it happen that that this is the way it is in the community, and you should just let it happen that we're being overly sensitive, and I had to respond to him and tell him that what he was talking about was was out of control and was inappropriate for this neighborhood. So I went to a borough service cabinet meeting and asked the fdny representative, and he just thought that notion was ridiculous. If people have the fireworks and paid for the fireworks they're going to set them off well, he did not talk them down the other thing what's going on, what's going on in the mind, if somebody is doing that, I'm not going to walk up to that. Why? No that's right! That's right! There is someone else who has their hand up nancy preston has her hand up yeah, I'm gonna allow okay, hi! Thank you! Yeah and just you know yes to tanya, and you know into bernard and we're here in the health committee, because this is a health issue. It's a public health issue and the mayor. Classifying this as quality of life, therefore telling NYPD from the top. You are not to enforce quality of life. They have been told this to step away to not enforce this. It's not. This is not quality of life. You can hear this is public health and it really needs to be established as a public health issue, world health organization CDC recognize noise as a health hazard, exacerbating many conditions. My husband has ptsd right, so you know you can imagine what people with ptsd went through this past month and it is. It is an absolute disgrace to see that you know our elected officials twice within two weeks were able to have press conferences on dickman to promote the open streets, but then they were nowhere to be found to advocate for the community under this condition that when that has gone on and it's still going on in certain areas, I'm hearing over at inwood hill park on that end and people are still being terrorized not to the same extent, but it's still happening. Thank you and at four in the morning, and I wanted to say too, I wanted to say that you know I sent an email to carmen de la rosa office to eudonis rodriguez about this and senator jackson about this issue. I didn't hear from anybody, but senator jackson's office, to respond to our concerns who actually took this chris, who was on his call, actually took the time to meet with our nancy myself and another, the administrator of the facebook group, to talk about these issues. I do want to acknowledge that happened. You know, and you know you know, I don't know what happened with everybody else, but you know it's we're. Gonna need we're. Gonna need their muscle to do something about this, because, as community members, we can only do so much as elected officials. They have the muscle they have the connection. They have the proximity to city hall to actually you know get some. You know get these issues and these concerns in front of the people who need to know who can make these changes. We can't do that, so we need to. We need them to step up. I don't you know it's. I think, and I'm gonna say this. I think a lot of people are thinking about votes for the future and they're not trying to piss people off they're like oh, you know we're gonna, just let this go because I'm to need their votes in about a year. I don't care about what people are running for. I, this community needs help. Now this community cannot be you know, put in the trash, because you want to appease people whose votes you think you're going to need for your next upward mobile, climbing of your on the political ladder that needs to be dealt with. Now I mean, let's be honest, we will not. We will not live through this next summer. We will not. This is ridiculous. I mean, if that's anybody's political strategy, that's a ridiculous strategy. I would argue that people setting off those fireworks are not are not your likely voters. The people who are concerned about this issue are the more people who are more likely to vote. Those are the people exactly those are the people you're pissing off and those are people they're, ignoring you're, losing their votes, you're, not gaining any votes by not acting on this issue. You know those people who are out there until three four in the morning said or fireworks. Those are not voters, I'm sorry, they're, not they're, not your likely voters. Just going back to the chat, real, quick, there's, someone who's been chatting a lot. It says anonymous attendee, but they're, not in the attendee list, so I don't know how to let them talk. I apologize, I don't know paolo. If you know neither do I if they're anonymous and you can't see them- and I can't see them- we can't tackle them over. Whoever is not listed on the attendees list. I cannot pull out of my hat. If they're, not there, we can't move. I do want to address anonymous attendee, you said tanya. Can you run for mayor? Let me tell you something they won't. Even let me have any position on this damn board on the mayor's office. So good luck, because I speak truth to power. I speak truth and I'm not here for the for the okeydoke. I am here for what is going on I'm here for this community. I don't have time for the nonsense. Okay, I don't and that's exactly why I'm I don't have any position on this board and will continue to do so as long as the powers that be are where they are. Thank you so anonymous attendees, very important question. How do we change this instead of like going over what the problem is? Why don't we talk about solutions right? All the elected officials in one room asking us ask the elected officials what the solutions are they have the power? Well, I tell you, I don't I don't think they can pay attention to it, they're, not even paying attention to it. I don't want to. I don't want to wait for them to come up with something, so my suggestion would be that when we reconvene in september we do a resolution, which is the way our community board transacts business, and we send a resolution to the mayor and to all the elected officials saying that they must come up with a strategy for next year that deals with this problem. They cannot let this problem exist, the way it existed this year. However, they want to address it. They are, you know the police and the other people are the experts. They need to come up with a strategy. They need to cut off the fireworks that are being sold in pennsylvania and upstate. They have to prevent them from coming into the city. They have to deal with the people who are out there until 3 4 in the morning. They have to deal with this problem. They can't just ignore it and then- and so I think we need to- we need to take a position as board members and I think in the meantime, we need to talk to our fellow board members, because I am somewhat fearful of there being a split on the board and some of our members saying that we should just allow this to happen, that people enjoy it and it's a part of the regular character. It's a regular part of the regular culture or character of the community, and we should not interfere with this, and so I think we need to do some homework ourselves and- and I think what I heard a little bit, maybe from curtis tonight, which is that maybe he is in sympathy with taking this kind of position, because I would want to do it jointly with the public safety committee and- and I you know, I think you know we need to go on record and the way to go on record is to pass a resolution. And we didn't even talk about the trash mess. That's left over from all the fireworks. Oh my gosh in the parks and everything I was cleaning it up. I got pictures no right yeah on the street corners, and I saw somebody post a couple of pictures on facebook. It's a ton of stuff right onto that. They left it right there on the street. Oh yeah, gunpowder everywhere, yeah say one more thing: yeah, it's bernard! I sent an email to the mayor's office and they did respond. They said that they take quality of life, complaints very seriously and for me to report it to 3-1-1. Okay, I'm sorry, yes, well, yeah had her hand up forever. Okay, and so is natalie has her hand up. Oh I'm sorry, natalie, okay, but fern go ahead. Okay, I just want to bring a little historical perspective. Here. We've done a number of resolutions about noise pollution in this community going back decades. There was a huge issue. I know steve will remember because he wrote it about noise around isabella with motorcycles. Yes, there was another huge issue in the neighborhood I mean I was on the board for about eight years in various decades. So I know that this has come up before, but steve is right. It's a lot about the political will of the board members, so you really do need to have that conversation among the board members, because you've got the language already drafted. Almost three quarters of it is already in previous resolutions, but if you don't have a solid majority of the board in favor, don't bother it's just going to be a gigantic fight that is not going to be worth having so you've got to do the free homework and figure out that you've got supporters on this yeah. Actually, I'm glad fern, I'm glad you raised referred to isabella betty I've been wondering how has isabella been handling this problem with all the fireworks around your buildings. Well, most of it would have been on amsterdam avenue. You know to be fair about it. We've been so consumed with dealing with Covid-19. To be honest with you that we, you know, that's not. I mean it's been an issue, but I can't say that you know we're fixated on that we've been dealing. It's been a crisis with us for the last three months. Four months, so I you know, I can't say, but I do remember that was done by leslie- foster yeah right back in the in the arts as they say, and it was all about motorcycles and noise yeah on the amazon avenue side yeah we actually we actually. There was one with fireworks too yeah the councilmember, the council, member, that I previously worked for stan michaels, actually passed a law declaring a noise-free zone around isabella or around nursing homes in general, having additional fines for noise violations around nursing homes, but in this particular situation did do you know whether isabella called upon the police to deal with any of these fireworks issues which probably were occurring right outside your building? I don't know- and I say that, because I you know I'm working from home- I'm not at the facility. Mostly. I can find that out and I will get back to you yeah I'd like to yeah. I would appreciate knowing because because hawking back to that situation, where, where we determined that noise was a particular problem for nursing home residents, that if you know, I think this might be another situation where, where maybe this law was not, this particular law was not being adhered to at all yeah and natalie. Oh yeah natalie, please hi well as steve. I want to thank you. I think that's great information about that law, about noise being banned around nursing homes, because now I think, I'm just going to put a sign on my building. That says that I'm a nursing home and I think we should all do it and then theater, but so our you know our cb12 family. Goofiness aside, I you know. I think that this is a. This is a useful approach of doing this as something that is crossing the purviews of many of your committees and that this is this goes beyond a quality of life issue and which is why you're dealing with it here and you know, layered on to the collective trauma of this pandemic right and then this is this- takes on a very different meaning and a different impact. When these loud disruptive disturbing noises take place, everybody has different reactions. I understand that I was very fortunate. My entire life, I had pets who would watch thunderstorms and fireworks like they were movies, but all you have to hear about is one example of a neighbor who is suffering, and that should change your mind about how you want to act, and so I trust you guys to be able to articulate that and bring together that conversation that you've been having for many years but make it very topical to what's going on now. Yeah very good point now I do want to make this a joint resolution of as many committees as as would be relevant in order to make sure we line up enough support within the board. Was it claudia, there's somebody on the chat named claudia, who wants to know where to send it are the addresses of the problem locations? You should send them to the community board office, which is at 5 30 west 166th street. Actually you can just email me steve simon 765, at gmail.com, so I had a question and this stems from someone else. Someone else nancy's question I believe about decibel level right. So we have laws about a decibel level that can cannot be met or should not be met. Right, yes, can we is it possible to maybe propose another that would be for a longer duration at a lower decibel level? I don't know that you have to worry about that, because I'm pretty sure that what these people are doing with their fireworks easily violates the existing code. I don't know that you have to worry about lowering the or changing any of the standards I'll take. Another look at the noise control code, but I'm pretty sure that you're not supposed to hear something at this kind of level from something like 50 feet away and you can hear it from blocks and blocks away. So it's just ridiculous it easily. I'm sure it easily violates the noise control code and I asked before about having noise ordnance signs. I went to the police again and I said what can we do. I said what about noise or in science? I've been coming in with solutions with scroll length, 311 calls data and everything, and they said well, you have to call dlt, they said the dlt, so maybe traffic transportation might have to get involved in this as well, because I called dlt and I never heard back from anybody. I called several times the information that I was given and I never heard back from anybody about noise or designs. They have them in other parts of the city, they have them in the upper east side upper west side. You see those noise ordered signs. This kind of nonsense will not be going on there. They will shut that down, and so, but they have those signs, we don't have those signs. That's another thing that could help with this problem too. You know debbie on this as well. Yes, debbie yeah. Do me a favor the next time you see one of those signs take a picture of it and send it to me. I have to go to the upper east side where the witch people live. I have to go where they go. They might stop me while I'm over there and say what are you doing here? They might get me you know like yeah. I know you also said it was on the upper west side. I don't go there often so can I just say real quickly to it's been wonderful, the people from the public that have been on here. This is obviously one of our non-regular meetings. Our next full board meeting is at the end of september. It would be great if folks were also there for the public session to talk about this, because, unfortunately, a lot of board members just don't get it and haven't heard from the public enough on this issue. A good suggestion I mean we're also having a are: we also having a committee of the whole meeting later on in July yeah in July yeah we're having a committee. Oh yeah, that's my question, steve. If we can't draft a resolution and present it to the committee of the whole, it's still going to wait till september. Yes, okay, but steve what okay so beyond a resolution? How do we as a board, hold all the other electives accountable and hold the police precincts? How do we hold these people accountable because I feel like? Yes, we can put on a resolution and obviously you have done that in the past, and so how do we ensure that we also are taking that next step and holding people accountable for addressing these issues? Because they're going to look at this resolution and trust me, it's going to go right in a file somewhere once they receive it, and what are they going to do after then? What so you know I want them to be accountable and actually, instead of telling me this is sparkle, and I will say people who say it's part of culture you're. Actually, disrespecting the culture of the people's community by saying this level of ignorance is what goes on all the time. That is disrespectful if that's to your own community, to say this is part of the culture for people act like this. That is ridiculous. So what are we going to do to hold these people accountable? To say we need to address these issues. What are you going to do as elected officials, people who show up at our meetings and tout their next whatever or who will hold a press conference about whatever or who are holding fundraisers for their next? Whatever you know, so what are we going to do you know? Can I make a suggestion who who's speaking that's bernardi, yeah I'll go ahead there? Okay! First of all, there are laws, so the they have to they have to enforce the laws that are on the books. I could say it's my culture to go, rob banks. Does that mean it's? Okay? If I go rob a bank, should I be allowed to just take the money and spend it wisely? I mean you know it's like it's like you know. It's not culture, it's law-breaking, it's people who want to break the law, that's it so there are laws. The law on the on fireworks, even sparklers, who that make no noise are illegal because they're, a fire hazard. That's what the that's! What the laws are about. Fireworks are it's a fire hazard. It's a danger! You can blow your hand off okay, the noise thing you have to have a permit to have a speaker, an amplified speaker on the street, I'm a guitar player. If I walk out into the subway and I take an amplifier down there, they'll bust me, okay, so I'm just so that's all they have to do. They can also confiscate the speakers and give them a disturbing the peace ticket which I hear is 450 and they don't get their speaker back until they pay the ticket. You know so all they have to do is enforce the laws yeah, but it's still about political will right exactly if there's not a consensus in this board of 50 people who represent this community, then there's not a consensus and we're talking to each other, but it isn't going to make change. The change happens with the political will of the majority of us wanting the same thing, and we just don't know if that's entirely true, I would suggest including traffic and transportation and aging in this conversation, because the signage is traffic and transportation for sure that's absolutely right. It's the all. Signage is d.o.t and, and the aging are very affected by the noise- very much so throughout the community, so that those would be my two suggestions steve yesterday and they have veterans groups, I'm sorry fern. I missed your first suggestion. Well, I was stuck with what you said originally, which was building consensus, and then I said you need traffic and transportation, because all signage is traffic and transportation, and you need aging, because the seniors are disproportionately affected by this frightening noise yeah. I don't know whether the signage actually comes from the transportation department, I'll look into that. Well, let me check in steve. Can I just share with you what I have been told when people have requested noise, signage yeah, we have been told that the neighborhoods, where those signs exist, those are kind of throwbacks to different periods when they used to do that and that they no longer do it, because it causes confusion right motor vehicle operators to have too much signage. So you guys with that information what you want. I also strongly recommend parks. My biggest fear is that I live next to a forest and that this is going to turn into an ugly scene from you know the news footage of California with an errand firework yeah. Oh yeah, definitely good point there and also isn't this a an issue that the public advocate might want to absolutely, since nobody is doing anything, maybe we should reach out to them, I'm all about who's going to be responsive if you're not going to be responsive to your own community. Well, maybe we should go out to the to the advocate and ask it certainly fits within a description of his office is to monitor city services, but listen. The committee of the whole this meeting on tuesday July the 28th. I don't see any reason why members of the public wouldn't be able to shouldn't should be able to call into that meeting as well and voice their opinions on this question, and I would encourage people to do that, and you know I think someone else said too. It's like this has been a great conversation. I think, but it's hard to have these conversations on the full board level. That's why you really need to reach out and talk to our fellow board. Okay, all right. I think we have a good sense of what we're gonna do so I'd like to try to wrap this up, because we are now going past, 9, 30. and tanya. Let's stay in touch and yeah, we can hopefully work on some resolution together for anonymous as it's you said, July 28th right steve is the tuesday July 28th. I don't. Is it at 6, 30 or 7 o'clock? That needs to be checked with the board office because unless they're going to have you know the meeting, it is in the calendar. But if there's no agenda items or there's no, you know I wouldn't know if it's gonna happen or not all right, so we people should call our. Can they call the office? Are people answering the phone? Ebenezer's phone is routed to the office, so anybody that calls the office should be getting ebenezer. Okay great, so you can call 212-568-8500 and you should call in to find out if we're having a meeting on July the 28th all right. So under old business, we have our monthly report from a dep on a service request from residents of washington heights. At inwood, there were 498 during the month of June 154 dealt with hydrants running full another 78 hydrants that were run. They were running but not full and then 36, complaints about dirty water and 31 complaints about noise from ice cream trucks. I sent this report to all of the committee members. We also have our monthly report from ddc about the water main and sewer projects in the district. The good news is that the one up in inwood is expected to be completed at the end of the summer that it's that now it's a 93 mark and hopefully, by the end of the summer, it will finally be finished. Is there any other old business? Is there any new business? There was something in the chat early on from so it says. Blah assembly, member, linda rosenthal and senator luis sepulveda recently introduced a bill to shut down slaughterhouses in new york. Considering the nature of Covid-19, I looked into and learned that there was about 80 slaughterhouses in new york city, one in inwood and none in affluent neighborhoods. Are we doing anything to support this bill to protect residents from health risks that come with having slaughterhouses, wet markets in the neighborhood? I don't know. Was it actually confirmed that that Covid-19 derives from a wet market? Was it wasn't? That was that just a well, you see it in the the plants you know in other parts of the country. I've heard it. Oh no! Well, those are I mean, those like you know the meat processing plants. I think you know that's I mean I think the the cl. I don't know. Let me let me check with de rosenthal's office on what the on what the backup is for that bill, I'll look into it. Okay, and does anyone know where the one in inwood is? I do know yeah, I think it's on. Is it on sherman avenue? Maybe was it 10th avenue on 10th avenue from 10th avenue? Oh 10th avenue. Okay, I've walked by it. Yeah, okay. Is it yeah? I seem to think it's like right off the corner. Is it your 207th correct by the way yeah? It's just. Is it primarily chickens, or I don't know what else yeah chicken, poultry, yeah, hey steve? I think somebody claudia had her hand up. I don't know if we missed it before just set to speak. I don't know what she's doing. Oh, okay, all right, let her let her yeah she's here, claudia you're, in there yeah hi. Thank you for taking it. I I'm not sure if this was addressed before I was out for a moment, but it was just going back to noise and you know the political will for enforcing it. Enforcing the noise code. I was wondering if we'd talked at all about just issuing tickets and that sort of thing so that it would be seen as less of a strong arm enforcement on something that seems like a minor nuisance about you know, being able to just take license plates of people who are playing their stereos for hours on end and you know just take the license plates and that in the in the public safety meeting, there was captain bellow from the 33rd precinct had said. Well, you know they're really trying to have a hands-off approach about what, if somebody doesn't want to hand over their license or what, if somebody's drunk they're just trying to avoid altercations, but if unfortunately yeah- and so I'm wondering if one of the solutions might be just a more hands-off okay, here's the license plate number okay list license plate has been reported three times for playing music at decibel level 300 for six hours straight, and I'm just wondering if you know finding some solutions that way could help create more political will. For I guess I want to call it peaceful or sort of paperwork enforcement yeah. Well, let me say you can lose your license if you have a certain number of what moving violations is that I'm not even a driver, so I'm not sure about this? What's what is there? Is there a way to? Is there a way to suspend somebody's license for for other types of infractions steve? This is what I've been trying to find out for, because all of you know I have known people who have gotten jammed up for sleeping off a bender in their car. Even though they didn't have the car operating, they were just sleeping it off inside and then other adult activities that take place in cars is very, it's very selectively enforced, and I think that that's what has to that's the conversation that I think captain philly, I'm just kidding, don't answer it we're on youtube. You don't want to get banned, but- and I was like my first license- exam as a teenager I took in Florida, so it was a different set of rules and I'm, like you, I'm a non-driver, so I never bothered to learn them past the day that you just take the learner's permit, but I do think that it's about you know. Charlie bellow had asked the public safety committee. What kind of policing do you want? What do you want us to go and enforce? And I think that has to be part of this broader conversation. Well, that is of how to get done, whether it's the rebels, whether it's the fireworks yeah. Well, that's the central question hanging over the city. Right now I mean that's like almost the number one question facing new york city at the moment. I wonder if I could add to that question since we have the drag racing and the motorbikes and those things since you know the bridge, the henry hudson bridge it has traffic cams, I'm wondering if traffic cams again as a very hands-off non-violent way of capturing license plate numbers of cars that are going way over the speed limit or cars that are doing donuts all night long in an intersection. You know if just asking for some more traffic cams might be one step that we could take forward. Well, I don't know I would like to see the cameras used to stop the people from bringing in the fireworks from out of state. I would like to see that we have some kind of you know. We send police officers to other states to check on on a variety of different like terrorism, crimes and other things we should station somebody right outside what is that place called phantom fireworks or whatever? It is this huge place that sells all the fireworks in pennsylvania? We should they should mark down the license plate numbers and if those license plates are coming over the gw bridge. As soon as they hit Manhattan, we should stop those cars and and empty out their trunks. I mean there's got to be a way to stop all that all of these fireworks from coming into the city. Well, I think that was de blasio's approach, but we also since they are illegal once they get into the city, we've got to enforce, seizing fireworks at the point, they're being shut off. Well, actually, when I hate to say this, but it was giuliani, I think who started something like this when he was mayor and it was and it was fairly effective- and you know, while he was mayor, we didn't have we didn't. There were a couple of years. We didn't have this huge fireworks issue, but- and I you know you know- maybe this is one thing we need to go back to, but with the cameras specifically, I think it's there's also a a budget issue like it's a capital, the capital request. Isn't it I'm not sure? But okay, because I know you know I live up close to inwood hill park and when, after the 2004 murder of the juilliard actress who I actually went to school with, they installed traffic cams in some of the parks that are not traffic camps, but they installed the cameras at the entrances to the parks and so on. So I mean I'm just bringing it up because they do exist up in nation park, for example, and one of the you know main locations where you hear a lot of noises just down the hill from there on at 5000 broadway. So and when you hear them doing donuts you think. Well, wouldn't it save a lot of money? Actually, even if it's an expense, but wouldn't it save money on policing and you know and having people go there to just have a camera that says. Oh this car going in donuts. What's that license plate? I- and I would also suggest similar to what I said earlier- is that the committees do their budget cycle a lot of them talk about it in september and October. So for that it'll be public safety as well as parks and cultural affairs- well, probably mostly public safety, because it would be the police that would have to put up those cameras, but the cameras they have are the red light cameras. They. I don't know how many we have up in our neighborhood, but they should catch that kind of the people doing the donuts as well they're going through the red lights. Aren't they sure so we're all gonna hear them right now: yeah, okay, so all right! Well, cook! Claudia! Thank you for that suggestion and watch out for that violin, you're holding it looks like a weapon. It's almost as loud as what we're usually hearing yeah. I don't know if it could play over the fireworks, though yeah I wish. Oh god I wish that were possible. Okay. How do we say the q, a steve? How do we say it? I don't know? Okay, I want to save it. How do I know you can say chat, but I don't know how to say the q a. I know you can just ask me, because I don't know either all I know that all that you guys have been doing for the moment I hit record is there, but I don't know the conversations in the chat if they're safe, I think you could cut and right now you daryl steve and I have the same functionality. So if you don't see it on your screen on a way that you can save it, neither can I well. The only thing I have over you guys is that I can shut everything off right now and then we're going to lose all the q a no. The way that you can save it is someone can screenshot it before you close out the meeting. There's a lot of this like 6 40 58 68 comments go ahead and collect all for now and paste it into something. Even if you lose the format, but as I've said before the chat or closed captioning, you know open captioning that comes with a transcript. Is your best bet for saving the material for after the meeting stops recording all right? Well, can someone can somebody do a screenshot of the q? A it's 68 comments. It's a lot. Look I jus. I was able to cut and paste it. The oh perfect. The format was really lost, but okay, it's still there somehow. So that's I just wanted you to have that steve. That's because I know you know I'm putting in an email to you and paulo. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all right, so we're gonna we're gonna, bring the meeting to a close at 9 45, exactly three hours after we began. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. Let's stay in touch bye, everybody bye! Thank you. Tanya, bye,.
