New york city has two hundred and sixteen thousand eight hundred and thirty four reported cases, and in Manhattan in particular, there are twenty seven thousand six hundred and forty one confirmed cases and, as many of you may have heard in the news, there is a slight uptick in positive cases among the 20 to 29 year old demographic What is causing that, but, as we all know, as the city has begun to open up.
But you know any time where people are gathered in large crowds, not practicing social distancing and not wearing the proper face coverings can all potentially be contributing to this uptick.
This information about these parties and fireworks and gatherings, is it's something you can call into 3-1-1 and have the mayor's office of special enforcement send out people like if you know, there's a particular party that happens every single night or every single saturday at a particular time.
We, don't really want to be sending NYPD out to these situations at this point, but I think it's really important that people still understand that Covid-19 is still a concern.
Are: are people who are just hanging out on the streets at night having their own little parties and not wearing masks, and you know they bring out their beach chairs or whatever, They just sit on the sidewalk and N't I.
And I know the mayor's community affairs unit has also expressed that if communities are seeing particular issues and concerns that they should be notified as well, so I am thinking that they would potentially send out inspectors from various agencies to come out and see what's happening with regards to any restaurants and the open, dining stuff.
I, wonder if it makes sense for department of health and mental hygiene to have a direct conversation with department of transportation and the mayor's office of special enforcement, so that at that level you can actually address those problems and reiterate what the regulations are.
It seems like there was this time period where businesses were allowed to keep their establishments and kind of operate, as you know, in an effort to get their businesses and make some money after being out of work for such a long time.
Don't know that they're holding any more meetings of during the summer to review, license applications, but it would still be relevant , I'm sure in september, and we should certainly talk to a sidro I wanted to say as much as I'm on the business development committee as well.
You know for to people like, as curtis was saying, keep allowing people to keep doing it again and doing it again and again, and there's no penalty That's actually going to be meaningful in order for people to be a disincentive for people to continue to engage in this behavior and steve just to point out in the chat.
Nypd is not enforcing for discussing, and you know I think that there's a lack of enforcement happening right now in the community.
Nor do they understand what a mask is, but I mean you know if a complaint is filed and I, don't believe that the police are the right people to enforce it, anyway, I'm trying to get them out of the business of import of them , that's another issue.
Gonna talk about an initiative they're working on in terms of providing increased mental health services to the northern Manhattan area, so harold and linda, I hope you're getting full use of it during the Covid-19 19 period.
The impact of the exacerbation of existing mental health and addiction problems that has gone on, and it has had a significant component that is affecting not only sort of people getting hit by the virus and families, but it's affecting everybody, young and old, of all stripes, and it's also laid bare.
Obviously, the advances in telemedicine, telemental healthcare, using technology in different ways, and also the way in which people have begun to think of ways that specifically, are dealing with some of the unique stresses that come up in the context of they come up in the context of a pandemic like this.
Could we think about in terms of proposing to try to make things better and try to deal with the both the existing behavioral health needs that are facing our community and disparities that exist, but also to address the impact of Covid-19 19 itself?
We want to support the existing community based network and social care network and organizations in the community, but also as we do, this- to serve as kind of a local and national model for how to address behavioral health, needs.
What we put together is a composite of six different ideas that are all kind of linked and integrated, but are based upon sort of our experiences and some of the tools and and resources that we've, you know, think that are needed for this area.
We think that an important element of a strategy to respond to these needs is also to build linkages and support with existing licensed behavioral health facilities in the community.
Both from the mental health side, as well as from the addiction side, and to do that in a way that supports them using sort of telehealth services and also this notion of a community behavioral health corps that I'll speak about in a few minutes.
Number three is that we also want to make sure that there's linkages to existing community-based organizations that are providing primarily social services, because many people who come through, who have these social service needs, are significantly affected by behavioral health problems and that are exacerbated by the pandemic.
Many of the of the primary care providers in the community see what's going on in terms of mental health, stress, depression, anxiety, increased substance use and they need additional support so to think about how we can advance integrated primary care and behavioral health care with local primary care.
We want to do this in a way we can continually assess how we're doing continuously improve the work that comes out of these initiatives and really make it a sort of national example of a learning health system and community partnership.
You have community-based organizations that have their own boards that have been providing services, including the fqhcs that are sitting right on the screen in front of me this morning, And that do a really good job.
You have the services that actually the state runs and pays for you know our washington heights community services and inpatient unit, and then we have new york presbyterian and everybody tries hard.
I. Think the other thing is the community organizations, including the churches in the community, are a great source of information and comfort, particularly with the grief that people are dealing, with, and I.
What we'd like to do is make psychiatric consultation available to them, as they do screenings and identify people from the faculty at columbia and do that virtually because a lot of treatment is now going on virtually and in addition to that, take this behavioral health core that we're discussing and train them really to be care.
And I think we have to be good neighbors and give support where we can Let me just open it up by saying that the expansion of mental health services in the community has been the number one budget priority of this committee and the community board.
When people start having to be indoors, will we see you know a real spike You know how much can people tolerate most people will do Okay with just a little support and help, When you look at people, my age actually and the kind of high-risk groups, you know people who have comorbid physical illnesses, people over 60, I mean you have people in the community who will get increasingly frightened if this happens in the fall, Well, I think I'm not going too far out on a limb by saying that the community board would welcome the opportunity to work with you to make this a reality.
Oh, I try not to use lingo, but you know we always fall back into our league, though all right- And, actually I am hoping that that we can establish some cooperative arrangement between you and and the ryan health center.
We we've laid out kind of an outline of what we think makes sense, but we definitely want to engage the community in further refining that all right, very good.
I, don't know that they provide any direct service in the community, but this is an organization that you might want to also consider when, when you're doing linkages to groups in the community, because they I know them well And also You should definitely be talking to all right, because I would like to see them get more involved in our community, and maybe this is one way to bring them in Certainly, this is a definitely an organization that has years of expertise, I'm, sorry decades of expertise, dealing with mental health, issues.
My concern is that in the new york presbyterian system it looks like we're down now: 80 beds, so well, I wonder how we're going to address the needs of the seriously mentally ill, both in our neighborhood, with the failure to reopen- What's going on at Brooklyn, methodist and I Can't speak to any of the inpatient facilities in terms of the new york presbyterian, but certainly we would not be excluding people with serious mental illness.
If people like health care workers can't sleep that takes an enormous toll on their mental health, can some of you speak to that in terms of what's been happening in our community?
It's especially significant with people that have had pre-existing behavioral health, conditions,, you're, absolutely right that that's a sort of a widely you know, trivialized, not recognized as a as an important contributor to the you, know: I.
No, we're not going to solve fireworks, but we can actually advocate for on behalf of this being a public health issue.
You know we have people right now suffering our community because of this, these issues.
One of the things that we can do is reach out to our school of public health, because this is one area where we can partner with them to work with the board on addressing this, and this is something that we've done in the past We can connect the right people at our school of public health to work with you on this We need some kind of backup in order to really send the message that this is how this issue has got to be taken more seriously.
Let you know that I just want to say that if you address this issue to the environmental department of the school of public health, if we don't have, they don't know, the data.
Also as we talk about public health as we talk about public safety as a and the issues that we are facing now with noise pollution, uptick in crime uptick in you, I know social science research, but I've.
And I do think that there could be a correlation between some of these byproducts of Covid-19 with some of the things we see in the community right now, and if we can make a case to say that well.
You, know right, now, so I do think that, as we dive deeper into this conversation of researching the impact of Covid-19 and the health additional health disparities, not just people of color dying at a higher rate than others, but looking at the disparities with their with the mental instabilities and the traumatic experiences that it has been has caused.
You know the mayor's wife, who is very committed to mental health as an issue, and she brought up the whole.
The police clearly aren't helping so the enforcement side, but this is clearly a mental health issue, as it relates specifically to the fireworks.
We are pretty excited about the site that we're going to be opening up in september before I go in I'd like to give a little background on ryan, health, and Basically, a federally quote: We are at federally qualified health center and what that means is we're.
I know you do a lot of that in your health kitchen branch And, then also, you know, in terms of like family planning, services, there's There's high higher numbers of teenage pregnancies in this neighborhood as well.
So, they know I work at isabella, which is 191st street and audubon avenue, and we provide a number of services in the community for older adults.
What I think there's room for a second floor There was no balcony, no all right, but let me tell you something: well, you know by the time I was around in that neighborhood.
I believe, because you know a lot of people get the flu and think they're.
We will be more than happy to have dr mingus come to the september meeting and provide a little more information around telehealth, and what are we doing around encouraging people to actually use it all right, all right, so we'll mark that down for september as well Do you have you have more to the report?
You know little to no income, they're homeless , they have medicaid, they live in the underserved areas, so they need that support and mental health.
We want to help our people as much as we can definitely, but they said we'll come back in May they promise us may we'll come back to allen hospital we'll take care of our patients.
Work Presbyterian needs to go through a regulatory process with the department of health and the office of mental health to close down a psychiatric unit, but some executive orders by Cuomo and the metrics to reopen new york state have made it so that psychiatric hospitals, not just in the city but all over the state, are closing down their units.
Meeting, I received the letter that we requested from senator jackson's office, demanding it's a letter to new york, presbyterian that they've delivered to new york, presbyterian It's demanding to open the allen psych unit which, with the same concerns that we have, and if I may just share the screen, I wanted I actually emailed it to you.
But those you know there are some people who come back, but for the most part that gives you an idea of how many people, our small unit, helps every year right.
You know just like everybody else, and stay at home, and I didn't go out, and my first reaction after we were able to kind of venture out a little bit more wasn't to go out and light fireworks every night, It is a persistent problem of just general disrespect for each for people in this community who don't respect other people.
It's about just noise pollution in general, and I have been dealing with this for 14 years, Since I, moved here, I have been contacting every all the elected officials going to the 33rd precinct talking to everybody there from the captain down about this issue going to the community of the police precinct community council meetings.
This has been a constant problem just because it's now reaching out to other parts of the community, because whatever was going on there- Since I've been here and what the response I get even from people on this board, is.
That, was also likely caused by fireworks at around the same time as the one on nagel say, nicholas at 180th, street, and I think, between 186th and 187th We let some of the people who are on the community like tell their own experiences, because I can't speak for everybody.
A these people have access to the q, Actually I, don't know, what's going to be done about the noise in this community, but it's just really out of control, and this is something that we all said over and over and over and over and over again.
Are these people where and what is the community board going to do to help us?
Too, and just so people know this, there are members of the board.
This community cannot be you know, put in the trash, because you want to appease people whose votes you think you're going to need for your next upward mobile, climbing of your on the political ladder that needs to be dealt with.
So my suggestion would be that when we reconvene in september we do a resolution, which is the way our community board transacts business, and we send a resolution to the mayor and to all the elected officials saying that they must come up with a strategy for next year that deals with this problem.
But in this particular situation did do you know whether isabella called upon the police to deal with any of these fireworks issues which probably were occurring right outside your building?, And, I, say that, because I, you know, I'm working from home- I would appreciate, knowing because because hawking back to that situation, where, where we determined that noise was a particular problem for nursing home residents, that if you know, I, think this might be another situation where, where maybe this law was not.
You know, I want them to be accountable and actually, instead of telling me this is sparkle, and I will say, people who say it's part of culture, you're.
If I, walk out into the subway Political will right exactly if there's not a consensus in this board of 50 people who represent this community, then there's not a consensus and we're talking to each other, but it isn't going to make change.
Can I just share with you what I have been told when people have requested noise, signage, Oh, yeah, definitely good point there, and also isn't this a an issue that the public advocate might want to absolutely.
We can hopefully work on some resolution together for anonymous as it's you, said, July 28th That needs to be checked with the board office because, unless they're going to have you know the meeting, it is in the calendar.
I'm, not sure if this was addressed before I was out for a moment, but it was just going back to noise You know the political will for enforcing it.
