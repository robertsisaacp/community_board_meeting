I, the last I heard was that they are doing slightly better in terms of you, know, reaching out to contacts and people providing helpful contacts.
I have not heard about this motorcycle situation, but you know any time where people are gathered in large crowds, not practicing social distancing and not wearing the proper face coverings can all potentially be contributing to this uptick.
This information about these parties and fireworks and gatherings is it's something you can call into 3- 1- 1 and have the mayor's office of special enforcement send out people like if you know, there's a particular party that happens every single night or every single saturday at a particular time.
We, do not really want to be sending NYPD out to these situations at this point, but I think it's really important that people still understand that Covid-19 is still a concern.
Are: are people who are just hanging out on the streets at night having their own little parties and not wearing masks, and you know they bring out their beach chairs or whatever, They just sit on the sidewalk and I.
I mean it would not hurt to let them know, And I know the mayor's Community Affairs unit has also expressed that if communities are seeing particular issues and concerns that they should be notified as well, so I am thinking that they would potentially send out inspectors from various agencies to come out and see what's happening with regards to any restaurants and the open, dining stuff.
I, wonder if it makes sense for department of Health and mental hygiene to have a direct conversation with department of Transportation and the mayor's office of special enforcement, so that at that level you can actually address those problems and reiterate what the regulations are.
You know, restaurants or operators who are really hell, bent on just getting their business back, to really try and do their best in terms of maintaining that social distancing for folks who are waiting or just following the rules.
There are some restaurants that really are trying their best, but unfortunately, there are a lot of people who are really just not following the guidelines that the state has put out Absolutely , I, think city Hall is very well aware of the situation where people are gathering, and you know.
It seems like there was this time period where businesses were allowed to keep their establishments and kind of operate, as you know, in an effort to get their businesses and make some money after being out of work for such a long time.
Covid-19 I do not know that they're holding any more meetings of during the summer to review, license applications, but it would still be relevant, I'm sure in September, and we should certainly talk to a sidro I wanted to say as much as I'm on the Business Development committee as well.
You know for to people like, as Curtis was saying, keep allowing people to keep doing it again and doing it again and again, and there's no penalty That's actually going to be meaningful in order for people to be a disincentive for people to continue to engage in this behavior and Steve.
I. Think that there's a lack of enforcement happening right now in the community and it is concerning We refer people to the Precinct Community council.
I mean you know if a complaint is filed and I do not believe that the police are the right people to enforce it.
Dr Rafael Antigua is also with us, both of whom have obviously been to community board meetings held this committee before, but also joined by two colleagues from our department of Psychiatry Dr Harold Pincus and Linda Rosenberg, a member of our faculty in psychiatry, you're, going to talk about an initiative they're working on in terms of providing increased mental health services to the northern Manhattan area.
The impact of the exacerbation of existing mental health and addiction problems that has gone on, and it has had a significant component that is affecting not only sort of people getting hit by the virus and families.
Side, there's also been an opportunity to kind of learn about new in a bit innovative ways to address mental health, needs.
Obviously, the advances in Telemedicine Telemental Healthcare, using technology in different ways, and also the way in which people have begun to think of ways that specifically are dealing with some of the unique stresses that come up in the context of they come up in the context of a pandemic like this.
Could we think about in terms of proposing to try to make things better and try to deal with the both the existing behavioral health needs that are facing our community and disparities that exist, but also to address the impact of Covid-19 itself?
We want to support the existing community based network and social care network and organizations in the community, but also as we do, this- to serve as kind of a local and national model for how to address behavioral health, needs.
What we put together is a composite of six different ideas that are all kind of linked and integrated, but are based upon sort of our experiences and some of the tools and and resources that we've, you know, think that are needed for this area.
We think that an important element of a strategy to respond to these needs is also to build linkages and support with existing licensed behavioral health facilities in the community, both from the mental health side, as well as from the addiction side, and to do that in a way that supports them using sort of telehealth services and also this notion of a community behavioral health corps that I'll speak about in a few minutes.
Number three is that we also want to make sure that there's linkages to existing community- based organizations that are providing primarily social services, because many people who come through, who have these social service needs, are significantly affected by behavioral health problems and that are exacerbated by the pandemic.
Many of the of the primary care providers in the community see what's going on in terms of mental health, stress, depression, anxiety, increased substance use and they need additional support so to think about how we can advance integrated primary care and behavioral health care with local primary care.
We want to do this in a way we can continually assess how we're doing continuously improve the work that comes out of these initiatives and really make it a sort of national example of a learning health system and community partnership.
You have the services that actually the state runs and pays for you know our Washington Heights Community services and inpatient unit, and then we have New York, presbyterian and everybody Everybody does good things and there are always some new and innovative programs, but for the average person, including myself, when we go to find care, we often can't, even though these services exist- And, one of the things we'd like to do by bringing these organizations together in a more robust manner, is make no door the wrong door so that there would be actual referrals between them sharing of information.
And I've seen it done in other places where people are able to move on then to college, to professional degrees, to nursing and really you know to gain the on hands- Colombia is a big piece of that community.
And I think we have to be good neighbors and give support where we can Let me just open it up by saying that the expansion of mental health services in the community has been the number one budget priority of this committee and the Community board.
Some of it could be billable in insurance, but we're just at a beginning, stage, and so what we may need from you is help As, the city and the state look towards funding they're going to get to deal with Covid-19 Is, I think we can expect as the fall ends and winter begins to perhaps have a resurgence.
When people start having to be indoors, will we see you know a real spike You know how much can people tolerate most people will do Okay with just a little support and help, When you look at people, my age actually and the kind of high- risk groups, you know people who have comorbid physical illnesses, people over 60, I mean you have people in the community who will get increasingly frightened if this happens in the fall, Well, I think I'm not going too far out on a limb by saying that the Community board would welcome the opportunity to work with you to make this a reality.
Oh, I try not to use lingo, but you know we always fall back into our league, though all right- We we've laid out kind of an outline of what we think makes sense, but we definitely want to engage the community in further refining that all right, very good.
If fountain house, is one of the organizations that you're thinking of reaching out to fountain house has a residence on Amsterdam avenue between 172Nd and 173Rd. I do not know that they provide any direct service in the community, but this is an organization that you might want to also consider when, when you're doing linkages to groups in the community, because they I know them well and also Dr Vassand- is on your faculty.
You should definitely be talking to all right, because I would like to see them get more involved in our community, and maybe this is one way to bring them in Certainly, this is a definitely an organization that has years of expertise, I'm, sorry decades of expertise, dealing with mental health, issues.
I can't speak to any of the inpatient facilities in terms of the New York Presbyterian, but certainly we would not be excluding people with serious mental illness.
If people like health care workers can't sleep that takes an enormous toll on their mental health, can some of you speak to that in terms of what's been happening in our community?
It's especially significant with people that have had pre- existing behavioral health, conditions , you're, absolutely right that that's a sort of a widely you know, trivialized, not recognized as a as an important contributor to the you, know: I.
No, we're not going to solve fireworks, but we can actually advocate for on behalf of this being a public health issue.
You know we have people right now suffering our community because of this, these issues.
One of the things that we can do is reach out to our school of public health, because this is one area where we can partner with them to work with the board on addressing this, and this is something that we've done in the past We can connect the right people at our school of public health to work with you on this We need some kind of backup in order to really send the message that this is how this issue has got to be taken.
Let you know that I just want to say that if you address this issue to the environmental Department of the School of public health, if we do not have, they do not know the data.
That will give a complete answer to you, but I will say that for the committee to aggressively freight and to the share of the Environmental Department Let's look into the issue: All right, So we're going to work with you and sandra on this all right, Other, all right , Steve, I'm sorry, somebody from the public.
Also, as we talk about public health as we talk about public safety as a and the issues that we are facing now with noise pollution uptick in crime uptick in you, I know social science research, but I've.
And I do think that there could be a correlation between some of these byproducts of Covid-19 with some of the things we see in the community right now, and if we can make a case to say that well.
You, know right, now, so I do think that, as we dive deeper into this conversation of researching the impact of Covid-19 and the health additional health disparities, not just people of color dying at a higher rate than others, but looking at the disparities with their with the mental instabilities and the traumatic experiences that it has been has caused.
You know the mayor's wife, who is very committed to mental health as an issue, and she brought up the whole.
The police clearly are not helping so the enforcement side, but this is clearly a mental health issue, as it relates specifically to the fireworks.
Is, a right, not a privilege, and this was first articulated by Congressman William F Ryan, who obviously we are named after and we live that every day and that goes back to every person that comes into the center needs to be treated with respect and dignity.
I know you do a lot of that in your health kitchen branch And, then also, you know in terms of like family planning, services, there's There's high higher numbers of teenage pregnancies in this neighborhood as well.
I just wanted to know if you are planning any special services for the older adults in the community.
They know I work at Isabella, which is 191St Street and Audubon Avenue, and we provide a number of services in the community for older adults.
We also are going to have a social worker at the site so that we will be able to provide some behavioral health services and again.
What I think there's room for a second floor There was no balcony, no all right, but let me tell you something: well, you know by the time I was around in that neighborhood.
I believe, because you know a lot of people get the flu and think they're.
What were you were able to get some of the statistics that I requested or not well right, now, in terms of Covid-19, you know, then, the stats that we have is really within our hospital up in northern Mahan, which Allen Tony and, of course, the hospital we do have 4:74 inpatient, Obviously, working with the hospital telemedicine, has been a huge portion, a part of what we've been doing over the last four months.
It's, a big issue for student health, colleges, people who grew up in New York students may go to school out of state.
You know little to no income they're homeless, they have medicaid, they live in the underserved areas, so they need that support and mental health.
Work Presbyterian needs to go through a regulatory process with the Department of Health and the Office of mental health to close down a psychiatric unit, but some executive orders by Cuomo and the metrics to reopen New York state have made it so that psychiatric hospitals, not just in the city but all over the state, are closing down their units.
I do not know that Dr Colwin is is going to be somebody who can be easily persuaded on this question, and I think the state needs to realize the ramifications of that executive, order.
But those you know there are some people who come back, but for the most part that gives you an idea of how many people, our small unit, helps every year right.
You know it's just the culture of the community or let people get to get it out of their system.
It's about just noise pollution in general, and I have been dealing with this for 14 years, Since I moved here, I have been contacting every all the elected officials going to the 33rd precinct talking to everybody there from the captain down about this issue going to the community of the police, Precinct Community council meetings bringing this up and you get nowhere.
This has been a constant problem just because it's now reaching out to other parts of the community, because whatever was going on, there- I've been living with this type of nonsense since I've been here and what the response I get even from people on this board.
We let some of the people who are on the community like tell their own experiences, because I can't speak for everybody?
Are these people where and what is the community board going to do to help us?
The proximity to city Hall to You, know get these issues, and these concerns in front of the people who need to know who can make these changes.
This community can not be you know, put in the trash, because you want to appease people whose votes you think you're going to need for your next upward mobile, climbing of your on the political ladder that needs to be dealt with.
So my suggestion would be that when we reconvene in September we do a resolution, which is the way our community board transacts business, and we send a resolution to the mayor and to all the elected officials saying that they must come up with a strategy for next year that deals with this problem.
We need to talk to our fellow board members, because I am somewhat fearful of there being a split on the board and some of our members saying that we should just allow this to happen, that people enjoy it It's a regular part of the regular culture or character of the community, and we should not interfere with this, And And I think what I heard a little bit, maybe from Curtis tonight, which is that maybe he is in sympathy with taking this kind of position, because I would want to do it jointly with the public Safety committee.
But in this particular situation did do you know whether isabella called upon the police to deal with any of these fireworks issues which probably were occurring right outside your building.
It would be great if folks were also there for the public session to talk about this, because, unfortunately, a lot of board members just do not get it and have not heard from the public enough on this issue a good suggestion, We also having a committee of the whole meeting later on in July In July We're.
Political will right exactly if there's not a consensus in this board of 50 people who represent this community, then there's not a consensus and we're talking to each other, but it is not going to make change.
My biggest fear, is that I live next to a forest and that this is going to turn into an ugly scene from you know the news footage of California with an errand firework, Definitely good point there, and also is not this a an issue that the public advocate might want to absolutely.
That needs to be checked with the board office, because, unless they're going to have you know the meeting, it is in the calendar.
I was wondering if we'd talked at all about just issuing tickets and that sort of thing so that it would be seen as less of a strong arm enforcement on something that seems like a minor nuisance about you, know, being able to just take license plates of people who are playing their stereos for hours on end You know just take the license plates and that in the in the public safety meeting, there was captain bellow from the 33rd precinct.
Right now I mean that's like almost the number one question facing New York City at the moment.
Actually, even if it's an expense, but would not it save money on policing, And, you know, and having people go there to just have a camera that says.
