as we all know, as the city has begun to open up, there are people gathering, outdoor dining There have been protests and people exercising their right to protest So. All of this could contribute to that particular segment of the population, seeing an increase in positive cases, but what we really want to make sure people are aware of is to maintain the core four, which is stay home.
But you know any time where people are gathered in large crowds, not practicing social distancing and not wearing the proper face coverings can all potentially be contributing to this uptick This information about these parties and fireworks and gatherings is it's something you can call into 3-1-1 and have the mayor's office of special enforcement send out people like if you know, there's a particular party that happens every single night or every single saturday at a particular time.
This would have this is a late night situation The mayor's community affairs unit has also expressed that if communities are seeing particular issues and concerns that they should be notified as well, so I am thinking that they would potentially send out inspectors from various agencies to come out and see what's happening with regards to any restaurants and the open, dining stuff.
So I also agree with daryl like that needs to be also on the agenda for business development, but also I wanted to say a lot of this You know this lack of social distancing, lack of mask wearing that's happening just by people hanging out on the street.
Parties outside their buildings, You know bringing out chairs and just hanging around on the sidewalks and here's the thing steve what they said to what you know the police show up right , they say: Well, we give these people some there's no way to like stop people from doing this.
You know for to people like, as curtis was saying, keep allowing people to keep doing it again and doing it again and again, and there's no penalty That's actually going to be meaningful in order for people to be a disincentive for people to continue to engage in this behavior and steve just to point out in the chat Also, two people have brought up specific spots in the neighborhood broadway and 161st street, as well as elwood and hillside.
We can figure out whether it's the office of special enforcement or some other entity that should respond, can I just add one point: I'm, sorry to jump in here too much steve where public safety matters, but That's a really important thing to mention to everyone on the call and who's listening several times 161St street Nypd is not enforcing for discussing, and you know I think that there's a lack of enforcement happening right now in the community.
Nor do they understand what a mask is, but I mean you know if a complaint is filed and I, don't believe that the police are the right people to enforce it anyway , I'm trying to get them out of the business of import of them There is a chart for confirmed deaths, and then there is a chart for confirmed and probable on our data.
You're gonna talk about an initiative they're working on in terms of providing increased mental health services to the northern Manhattan area, so harold and linda I hope you're getting full use of it during the Covid-19 19 period.
It has affected every single citizen in our community in all kinds of ways, not just the added stress that they experience, but the grief that families have had to deal with the impact of unemployment, the impact of the exacerbation of existing mental health and addiction problems that has gone on, and it has had a significant component that is affecting not only sort of people getting hit by the virus and families, but it's affecting everybody, young and old of all stripes, and it's also laid bare Not. Just the tremendous exist existing needs for behavioral health in the community, but also the significant disparities that are faced by different populations that have been traditionally underserved, and so that's really called our attention to figuring out how to deal with some of these issues.
There's also been an opportunity to kind of learn about new in a bit innovative ways to address mental health needs Obviously the advances in telemedicine, telemental healthcare, using technology in different ways, and also the way in which people have begun to think of ways that specifically are dealing with some of the unique stresses that come up in the context of they come up in the context of a pandemic like this Could we think about in terms of proposing to try to make things better and try to deal with the both the existing behavioral health needs that are facing our community and disparities that exist, but also to address the impact of covet 19 itself?
We want to support the existing community based network and social care network and organizations in the community, but also as we do, this- to serve as kind of a local and national model for how to address behavioral health needs This context, and also with a particularly innovative approach, would be to provide training and employment for community lay persons as part of a new community behavioral health corps What we put together is a composite of six different ideas that are all kind of linked and integrated, but are based upon sort of our experiences and some of the tools and and resources that we've, you know, think that are needed for this area.
So number one is focusing on the needs of health care workers In this case we've actually had some direct experience in doing that, the you know, being the epicenter of the pandemic The past several months had a huge impact on the on the mental well-being of our healthcare workers and, as a result, we developed a very innovative approach to try to deal with some of those issues that we've called coke columbia.
We think that an important element of a strategy to respond to these needs is also to build linkages and support with existing licensed behavioral health facilities in the community Both from the mental health side, as well as from the addiction side, and to do that in a way that supports them using sort of telehealth services and also this notion of a community behavioral health corps that I'll speak about in a few minutes.
Number three is that we also want to make sure that there's linkages to existing community-based organizations that are providing primarily social services, because many people who come through, who have these social service needs, are significantly affected by behavioral health problems and that are exacerbated by the pandemic.
Number Many of the of the primary care providers in the community see what's going on in terms of mental health, stress, depression, anxiety, increased substance use and they need additional support so to think about how we can advance integrated primary care and behavioral health care with local primary care providers.
You have the services that actually the state runs and pays for you know our washington heights community services and inpatient unit, and then we have new york, presbyterian and everybody tries hard, and one of the things we'd like to do by bringing these organizations together in a more robust manner is make no door the wrong door so that there would be actual referrals between them sharing of information and really it would appear seamless, and it would be a seamless experience for the families living in the community from the elderly really to young people.
Managers, One of the things I'm personally very passionate about, is that the behavioral health core, which are community members, have a career path and I've seen it done in other places where people are able to move on then to college, to professional degrees to nursing and really you know to gain the on hands-on experience.
You know colombia is a big piece of that community and I think we have to be good neighbors and give support where we can Let me just open it up by saying that the expansion of mental health services in the community has been the number one budget priority of this committee and the community board So we absolutely would welcome any additional services coming into the community and especially from the medical center, with your expertise and the certainly the idea of linkages strengthening the linkages with existing cbo's When.
But when you look at people, my age actually and the kind of high-risk groups, you know people who have comorbid physical illnesses, people over 60 I mean you have people in the community who will get increasingly frightened if this happens in the fall, Well I think I'm not going too far out on a limb by saying that the community board would welcome the opportunity to work with you to make this a reality.
you know we always fall back into our league, though all right- and actually I am hoping that that we can establish some cooperative arrangement between you and and the ryan health center we've laid out kind of an outline of what we think makes sense, but we definitely want to engage the community in further refining that all right, very good, Any questions from all committee members, sally I know: Will there be partnership with nyp Queens in terms of this project So, it's a continuous improvement model that involves research but also documenting the success and actually promulgating what we've learned to to be disseminated.
But this is an organization that you might want to also consider when, when you're doing linkages to groups in the community, because they I know them well and also You should definitely be talking to all right, because I would like to see them get more involved in our community, and maybe this is one way to bring them in and and certainly this is a definitely an organization that has years of expertise , I'm sorry decades of expertise dealing with mental health issues.
My concern is that in the new york presbyterian system it looks like we're down now 80 beds, so well, I wonder how we're going to address the needs of the seriously mentally ill, both in our neighborhood, with the failure to reopen-.
In fact those are the people who are in some ways most at risk right If people like health care workers can't sleep that takes an enormous toll on their mental health, can some of you speak to that in terms of what's been happening in our community?
To be honest in the community, because I cannot live in my own apartment, So, I'm, thinking about those health care workers, those essential workers and other people who might be having suffering from mental health issues, because I've had people contact me and say I'm.
Don't think we have the capacity in this initiative to say we're going to interrupt fireworks Can, we address it as a mental as noise pollution as a as a as a public health issue?
You know we have people right now suffering our community because of this , these issues Make it clear that this is a public health.
Tanya One of the things that we can do is reach out to our school of public health, because this is one area where we can partner with them to work with the board on addressing this, and this is something that we've done in the past and we can connect the right people at our school of public health to work with you on this Let you know that I just want to say that if you address this issue to the environmental department of the school of public health, if we don't have they don't know, the data That will give a complete answer to you.
You know right now, so I do think that, as we dive deeper into this conversation of researching the impact of covet and the health additional health disparities, not just people of color dying at a higher rate than others, but looking at the disparities with their with the mental instabilities and the traumatic experiences that it has been has caused.
The greatest unmet need for health care in Manhattan the rates of many diseases you could see diabetes, cardiovascular cancer were disproportionately high from the rest of the city and even hospitalizations relating to those diseases When we looked at it, it really popped out at us when we had the consultants come in and really look at it that this is an area that kind It should be in, so that we can provide the services that your community needs and as I mentioned, average income is also 40 below the borough wide average in 2019 To. We did service over 50 000 patients throughout minute throughout new york city and about 70 of them had medicaid and or medicare, and about 12 were uninsured that I'm gonna turn it over to sam bartels, who is the executive director of our west 97th street site set, which is the largest site throughout the network, and one of the any older site and sam has been taking the lead in setting up the operations of the new site So. We will be located on 1015 watchwood avenue right at the corner of 181st street and westwood We considered many of many options and we chose this site as the as it was centrally located Apparently.
They had over 40 000 calls on telemedicine, so we thought that is important for us to produce and disseminate as wide as we can a video that would at least educate our community around telling that health So, if you bear with me for a second I, want to be able to just show that, to you tell me one more time: What was the parade that in which the acn had a double its normal intake, so that was that was from march 1st through may, 31st We can read sure what I this is actually both in english and spanish What I'll do is I'll email that to stephen paola, and maybe you could submit that to committee members and folks who are also here on the line.
Think you know the purpose of really was to generate start- that discussion around it We will be more than happy to have dr mingus come to the september meeting and provide a little more information around telehealth, and what are we doing around encouraging people to actually use it all right, all right, so we'll mark that down for september as well Do you have you have more to the report?
So one thing that scenario: most people say that one visit sort of emergency phone call is not going to cause you a problem, but any sort of extended, continuous care You have that second phone call: You have to take special precautions to make sure that nobody on the outside can like hack into the call and and protect the privacy of the patient and absolutely and the systems that we and your presbyterian uses are fully compliant fully hyper-compliant and your privacy is protected.
Prior to this, a telemedicine visit had to be video, just they're, a number of folks who, frankly, don't have that technological base capability governor signed legislation allowing for audio only televisions, We suspect that over the next couple of months, you're going to see an effort in washington on the federal level we're starting to have some conversations with folks in albany about it as well again, this licensing issue is one: That's probably needs to be handled on a state level, The issues of payment and these companies call site My question with telemedicine is: How do the reimbursement rates for medicare differ for an office visit like a new office visit, that is telemedicine versus in person and also for commercial insurance?
A these people have access to the q, a so Actually I, don't know, what's going to be done about the noise in this community, but it's just really out of control, and this is something that we all said over and over and over and over and over again, where are the elected officials common de la rosa, the donnie rodriguez, when they want to go in somebody's pocket to get money?
It is an absolute disgrace to see that you know our elected officials twice within two weeks were able to have press conferences on dickman to promote the open streets, but then they were nowhere to be found to advocate for the community under this condition that when that has gone on and it's still going on in certain areas, I'm hearing over at inwood hill park on that end and people are still being terrorized not to the same extent, but it's still happening.
Members, because I am somewhat fearful of there being a split on the board and some of our members saying that we should just allow this to happen that people enjoy it It's a regular part of the regular culture or character of the community, and we should not interfere with this and I think what I heard a little bit, maybe from curtis tonight, which is that maybe he is in sympathy with taking this kind of position, because I would want to do it jointly with the public safety committee.
They said that they take quality of life complaints very seriously and for me to report it to 3-1-1 We've done a number of resolutions about noise pollution in this community going back decades , It's a lot about the political will of the board members.
But in this particular situation did do you know whether isabella called upon the police to deal with any of these fireworks issues which probably were occurring right outside your building?
The committee of the whole this meeting on tuesday july the 28th I, don't see any reason why members of the public wouldn't be able to shouldn't should be able to call into that meeting as well and voice their opinions on this question and I would encourage people to do that and It's like this has been a great conversation We can hopefully work on some resolution together for anonymous as it's That needs to be checked with the board office, because, unless they're going to have you know the meeting, it is in the calendar If there's no agenda items or there's no, not all right, so we people should call our Can. They call the office?
