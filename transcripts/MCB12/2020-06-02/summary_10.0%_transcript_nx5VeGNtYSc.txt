It's to really know that, so we can respond, and so one of the things the resolution asks is for the various federal state and local kovat 19 related small business funding programs to provide our community with community specific data by race, gender and ethnicity.
I would like us to just acknowledge, what's happening right now in our community and New York and just sort of you know open it.
We are have witnessed some really horrendous things in terms of police, violence and other types of violence, the rash at black people, black men, and we want to just acknowledge that it's happening a lot of people- businesses, as we were discussing before we started, are in our community of dealing with this, because we have, you know, sort of fringe things going on like lutein and other that's impacting small business.
So we're gonna start with Cirillo moranto from 8:09, and we are, you know we as part of our business development committee for those who might be joining us from the community.
I. Think you guys know that I'm be part of this community for 45 years, just some diamonds alone , I've been 35 years since I opened up my first business, which is which was the grocery store and the corner grocery store diamond and a Nagar Avenue.
I haven't been moving out here for 45 years, I'm planning to stay to stay in my neighborhood, but things are getting rid of rough We would mean me personally, I, don't know if I want to be able to go to do what I used to do to you know to stay at stable to stay in business, Because we to be honest with you, I, don't think we're gonna check and rate that money.
I know that they're looking for a lot of places, especially in the heights, has anyone reached out to you to maybe use your or rent your space for testing, not no more habit, we job so now.
If 809 is open, they should be having antibody testing up here for the community, so maybe something we should think about when it comes to using underutilized spaces right now, especially like eight or nine eleazar.
Think Domingo, you right on that, because you know we are we all brothers and sister, and now we as a small business, you know we were coming from most of these pieces.
You mention when you said earlier about using it or not as a space, I, think, honestly, every single club or bar that has some sort of open space like 10th, Avenue?, Seventy, something and then all the place places in on Dyckman that if we can convert those spaces into testing grounds for either Kovac or antibodies and probably get some government funding that can help these faces stay open.
If you have any suggestions, but I think one of the areas that seems that collectively we cut we've come to an agreement, it's with the whole being able to identify temporary uses for these spaces in order to generate revenue so that we could be able to alleviate the burden once the business has to reopen And I think like Nobles stated, potentially using these as testing sites for both antibodies and for the virus seems to be.
Looking at allowing people to use outdoor space, You know when it's time to reopen, and there will need to be steps taken to help these businesses to get to that point, Do. You have any closing remarks on a ways that we could potentially effectively advocate or any project anything you would like us to amplify in regards to resources for your business Anything.
But that's what I'm trying to say like there's ways around it, and it's just about understanding the laws and being able to make sure that our community benefits and we find those gray areas, because if corporations could avoid paying taxes, we should be able to help our people get the proper recognition, CD low.
Fortunately enough, you were the only test, the small business testimony today, because everybody is busy putting up the la medida and crying play will apply no windows, And. The great thing is just know that we're working Tonya Bonner has a great resolution that we will make sure is reflective and that our voices are heard.
Thank you, for you know, for the invitation to participate in the committee meeting before I go into an update for the recurring legislation for small business communication.
A lot of businesses in our community are not being approved for these loans, but you know I like to hear more about what the situation is, whether they you know he applied and didn't get it Give me.
One second I mean give me just one: Second, Gonna have to start canvassing and figuring out what the current state of some small businesses are: Is about Copa pool on the highest percentage of PPP loan approvals that I've seen in the community is actually coming from them, and What I would suggest is that as a committee, we start looking into what are the role that some of these banks are having within our community.
But a bank is supposed to provide more services to our community than just a storefront or just a quick access to their corporate banks, and that's something that I feel like we do have to question, because it seems like there's a difference, the differentiation in relationship when it comes to businesses, downtown and businesses in Washington Heights and the uptown areas of Harlem, Washington Heights in word, and the Bronx As a committee is what role do banks have in our community and it is it just face value?
, you know, cancel rent for three months, or you know allowed, or at least for commercial tenants to allow them to exonerate them the value of those three months worth of rent- So question, though, the same way that there's subsidies for big corporations and people that employ over a certain amount of individual there's, certain city and state subsidies.
Is there anything being currently drafted or in the talks around like potentially having some sort of local city as BA, SBS, bail out or reopening packages for small businesses?
That's able to be allotted for the reopening back of the city and identifying particularly communities that have a and like Tonya's resolution is addressing a certain amount of vacancy storefronts right.
You know forward in you, know, post reopening, and that includes you know the business community You know all the other issues that people are facing: lots of jobs.
Know, of this crisis, I mean small businesses are hurting a lot and now, with everything that is happening in the last couple of days , You know some other small businesses like pharmacies to participate with city programs that offer you know, discounts or some types of services to seniors in the community.
Because I'm, not you know, as people start to open back up and other activities may begin in terms of inspections and things like that?
At that time you know, I really do understand what the value of a dollar is when it comes to opening up a small business, and it just broke my heart to see the images that we saw last night in the Bronx I.
Rent package that we just passed last week in the legislature will only help 50 to 60,000 New Yorkers, and while it is some money and in this time of really hard economic times, you know helping 50 or 60,000 New Yorkers is better than helping no New Yorkers, but I honestly feel that I'm personally, tired of settling for the crumbs that are put on our tables and not being able to deliver for our communities robust packages of legislation that is actually going to prevent evictions.
It was a very hard vote for me because I do believe that in this time of economic hardship, we gotta help people we have to help them and if one constituent in my district receives $600 a month for three months I think that we still have who I don't think I know that we still have not addressed the issue of commercial rents during this pandemic.
We, have the support of over 50 coalition, orgs and unions, and we're like moving the conversation forward to make sure that some of our workers and our communities can benefit from some of this.
I'm gonna, open it up for questions, okay, Cool, We had a conversation around banks right, And, I, think what people we were working on an event wave with somebody woman that Arosa around doing like what folks need to know about banks and not it just being face value for what is the purpose What are the expectations that the community should have on these banks?
It's, extremely important to be able to know Are the importance of what are the roles of banks within our community and what does it mean to have a branch within the community because a branch is supposed to serve as a connection to the to the entity, not What benefits are you bringing to the community in which that branch is located and You was talking about all these different ways that we can tax and raise money and funds for future issues with pandemic and small businesses.
I. Don't know if that's gonna be delayed because of the pandemic, but in your circle, in your area of expertise and the bills and things that you hear what are they're talking about when it comes to cannabis And, how can those potential earnings or monies can come into our community and help us similar to what those taxes can do as well?
We need to be the ones that are making the decisions for these companies to come forward, and so that wealth can be kept in our community and grow, because when you eat the people around you eat and most likely.
One thing that we could incorporate is: What does it look like to work with a community beyond face value and that's something within itself:?
Agreements are where the developer agrees to pay for a study to understand the recreational needs of a community and also fund, whatever the study produces, which could be certain equipment in parks, creation of parts creation of a community center that people can use one of the things that I wanted to go a little bit do a little bit deeper dive on is: What's considered, the largest community benefits agreement in the country, and this was agreed to in December of 2004 in Los Angeles Just read off a couple of the details, because I mean ultimately in the end.
So, if somebody's gonna come to our community and part of business, development is also being able to make sure that we leverage these developments to be able to meet the needs of our community, but also the means of local businesses.
We have to stop thinking about the crumbs and start realizing that when folks want to make money off of our community, there should be a standard that the helps and works with everybody, including our small businesses and certain guarantees.
I. Think that the other piece and by the way, I mean I, commend the community board for negotiating the community benefits agreement with 181st Street I'm, a very big believer that it is really important that people or organizations that may not be in the formal structure also be at the table on negotiating because I think.
The great thing about the community board is that it actually does have a lot of diverse voices, and you know It's just so important to reiterate that when you have diverse voices around the table, then you get.
Don't think it was even clear what which were the two sides, but that was also a you know, a small fraction of what the Manhattanville project was, but that also necessitated community benefits.
You think it would be prudent on this one, because I feel, like the banking needs to be a statement that we do alone, like a resolution just for banking and the type of business that you know what you think.
One of the things that you know when we return to whatever our new normal is that I'll continue to work on is getting the leadership of whatever these branches that we have available, either on the full, seven or Dyckman, or in wood, Washington Heights to come out and actually support, because we don't see a lot of a lot of banks in small community.
How do we, you know, use this not only to empower ourselves or empower more people that are like us to be in positions where we can actually make decisions now, This particular resolution.
We want to make sure that this community, that it is a targeted thing that we, that whomever, is offering cofee related small business funding for rebuilding, that we want to make sure that is targeted towards communities like ours, where there's a large minority and immigrant population, and that would include not only just the bank relationship.
Specific data I know like on a federal level, there's a database that you can look up and see who got federal funding and there should be the same available in a state and city level.
He leads the efforts at Apple bank on 181st Street and he's also a resource being able to provide information as to like, because I consider Apple Bank Apple back as a community bank right, correct, senex, Yes, I mean we only have some branches food work, but we're not a big corporate we're not publicly owned, so we're not public, so or family owned, ok, perfect and just feel free to chime in anything else.
I just want to make sure that it emphasizes that our community is made up overwhelmingly of small businesses, not national chain stores or major stores, and it's the small businesses such as in communities like ours, that need to help the most You know.
