It's to really know that, so we can respond, and so one of the things the resolution asks is for the various federal state and local kovat 19 related small business funding programs to provide our community with community specific data by race, gender and ethnicity on who received the funding both now.
A lot of people- businesses, as we were discussing before we started, are in our community of dealing with this, because we have, you know, sort of fringe things going on like lutein and other that's impacting small business.
So really, you know I just want to open it up and see If. If not, we can, just you know, go right on into talking with our business owner from 8:09, so we're gonna start with Cirillo moranto from 8:09, and we are, you know we as part of our business development committee for those who might be joining us from the community.
, you know what I could stay open for five six months That's that happened to me because you know the amount of money that I guys that it was so much and the thing is that I see you know we as a small business, Okay I'm opening up the floor to anybody in the committee that has any questions concerns.
If you people are retail to do curbside and things like that, and who knows, we might be in that phase for a few weeks, and then we will get to the phase of restaurants I believe it's phase, two from what I saw the last thing I saw on the governor's press conference, but I believe there were restrictions , they're gonna be restrictions like it could be capacity and then outdoor they're, looking at allowing people to use outdoor space You know when it's time to reopen, and there will need to be steps taken to help these businesses to get to that point.
I pay taxes now we're in a situation where we don't see, reform coming and these people may never get the benefit ever of the of the money Thank you so much Angela, but that's what I'm trying to say like there's ways around it, and it's just about understanding the laws and being able to make sure that our community benefits and we find those gray areas, because if corporations could avoid paying taxes, we should be able to help our people get the proper recognition, Unfortunately, fortunately enough, you were the only test, the small business testimony today, because everybody is busy putting up the la medida and crying play will apply.
Copa pool on the highest percentage of PPP loan approvals that I've seen in the community is actually coming from them, and what I would suggest is that as a committee, we start looking into what are the role that some of these banks are having within our community But a bank is supposed to provide more services to our community than just a storefront or just a quick access to their corporate banks, and that's something that I feel like we do have to question, because it seems like there's a difference, the differentiation in relationship when it comes to businesses, downtown and businesses in Washington Heights and the uptown areas of Harlem Washington Heights.
So question, though the same way that there's subsidies for big corporations and people that employ over a certain amount of individual there's, certain city and state subsidies Is there anything being currently drafted or in the talks around like potentially having some sort of local city as BA, SBS, bail out or reopening packages for small businesses?
One I'm, basically focusing more on a substantive just an amount of money, That's able to be allotted for the reopening back of the city and identifying particularly communities that have a and like Tonya's resolution is addressing a certain amount of vacancy storefronts right.
It was a very hard vote for me, because I do believe that in this time of economic hardship, we gotta help people we have to help them and if one constituent in my district receives $600 a month for three months I think that we still have who I don't think I know that we still have not addressed the issue of commercial rents during this pandemic and Syria was in a hole before the pandemic hit, because the lowest thing that he does not as a month for the renovate all nine and how could he possibly without making any money, continue to keep his doors open right and this If it's based on a pandemic.
This small business loan is available, On my mind, small businesses that have a gross revenue of less than 3 million dollars per year or nonprofits that provide direct services and have an annual operating budget of less than 3 million and have now received either That's the a PPP program or the SBA economic injury disaster funding for covert This is basically law, that is, for those businesses that have been excluded from those funds and, in addition to that state pot of money, there's also a pot of money that was put together by the State Comptroller, and he announced 50 million towards a small business relief, job retention and it's available for New York businesses with no low minimum, but a maximum sets at 350 thousand 25% of the loan is targeting women and minority-owned businesses, and basically it's for businesses that, let's see businesses , what type of PPP can apply for this loan as well and UK, and it's part of the 484 billion relief package that was included from the federal government and As far as these two funds of money, pots of money that exists and I think that workers are a big part of the work force and our small businesses is the excluded worker fund.
We have the support of over 50 coalition, orgs and unions, and we're like moving the conversation forward to make sure that some of our workers and our communities can benefit from some of this I'm gonna open it up for questions.
Okay, cool We had a conversation around banks right and I think what people we were working on an event wave with somebody woman that Arosa around doing like what folks need to know about banks and not it just being face value for what is the purpose and what are the expectations that the community should have on these banks?
Again, it's extremely important to be able to know are the importance of what are the roles of banks within our community and what does it mean to have a branch within the community because a branch is supposed to serve as a connection to the to the entity, not just What benefits are you bringing to the community in which that branch is located and You was talking about all these different ways that we can tax and raise money and funds for future issues with pandemic and small businesses?
It will be part of our conversation whenever it legalized and I think we should start preparing for that conversation and get ahead of any programs, and we could take advantage of or speak to the Carmen's of the world and make sure they come in and talk to us and keep us abreast of what is happening in the political realm, because a lot of us are completely lost and I just get the feeling that communities like the Heights and Harlem and the Bronx are gonna, be last I'll, say this: at the end of the day, if we have individuals that could advocate the way the way car like Carmen broke it down the question Cuz I, understand like the elders are a big voting block in the heights, but unfortunately, that it's changing like Washington Heights is not what it was.
One of our committee members, tiny time of my assistant, chair Tania, my co-chair She, did put together a great resolution around How. Do we reopen and what does that look like, and some of the supports and I think Tanya if you're integrates with that another key element to it, is: are we holding banks accountable for the face value that they just keep giving our community, which is you could come cash?
You know, I think that it's important for us to have that conversation as well and I look forward to engaging with the committee in In my mind, I also love to read on this stuff because on the committee, so, if I can ever be of service, just call them That's gonna be the last question before we move on just an update on the agenda.
Building We will be there in full force presenting our agenda as legislators of color of what we want to see when it comes to police accountability, and you know enough to just say that I love you all So. Moving on to the agenda, so we have a presentation around CBA's I heard that term a few months ago, for the first time, community benefits agreement and I was participating in a meeting that the congressman, the ironist bhaiyaa, held up with the tower that new development in eternity first Street and Amsterdam and I found it very interesting that there are agreements out there that are legally binding, that we don't have an understanding of, and we don't have an understanding if they're still being upheld.
Agreements are where the developer agrees to pay for a study to understand the recreational needs of a community and also fund, whatever the study produces, which could be certain equipment in parks, creation of parts creation of a community center that people can use one of the things that I wanted to go a little bit do a little bit deeper dive on is: What's considered the largest community benefits agreement in the country, and this was agreed to in December of 2004 in Los Angeles and so I'm gonna just read off a couple of the details, because I mean ultimately in the end, when it comes to community benefits agreement, we can decide what that is.
Negotiations are currently happening in our community in our name right If somebody's gonna come to our community and part of business, development is also being able to make sure that we leverage these developments to be able to meet the needs of our community, but also the means of local businesses right like, for instance, right There should be CPAs that provide ownership to small businesses within our community within those particular projects, for instance, if we're building a hotel room right, a big hotel that has X amount of commercial space etc, and it's renting no space, and this is where I say the importance of a land.
It's important to note that we have to start thinking and Carmen spoke about that We have to stop thinking about the crumbs and start realizing that when folks want to make money off of our community, there should be a standard that the helps and works with everybody, including our small businesses and certain guarantees.
There has to be a process around when a community benefits agreement is about to be negotiated and the process can be created by multiple stakeholders on the end of the process and I mean this is something that can be developed together with the community board with uncertain, potentially certain nonprofits or certain, even certain individuals that have that are tapped in there are these folks that are informal leaders that are tapped into the community and so I think it just takes someone taking you know leadership and saying we got to make sure that these voices are at the table as well, and just and didn't just create a process for that Sally.
That's one of the things that you know when we return to whatever our new normal is that I'll continue to work on is getting the leadership of whatever these branches that we have available, either on the full, seven or Dyckman, or in wood, Washington Heights to come out and actually support, because we don't see a lot of a lot of banks in small community events.
That is by giving back to our community So. In order for us to do that, the best way to do it is for us to work together and understand that we're not here to compete, we're here to make sure that this community progresses so I would love to see more banks out there and for the funny fact is that a lot of the branches in Inwood are minority and female run Not only to empower ourselves or empower more people that are like us to be in positions where we can actually make decisions now this particular resolution I would say: Is it's really looking at the broad picture in terms of we're about to start the reopening phase and a lot of our businesses have been struggling, even pretty no pre-pandemic, as the resolution kind of outline outlines, This is looking at all of the financial The targeted funding set aside for Colvin we're rebuilding for small businesses.
We want to make sure that this community that it is a targeted thing that we, that whomever, is offering cofee related small business funding for rebuilding that we want to make sure that is targeted towards communities like ours, where there's a large minority and immigrant population, and that would include not only just the bank relationship but they're also, you know they're also other private funding that could pop up or maybe they're now, and we may not be aware , we want to make sure that we, our businesses, can access that and that we are demanding that we are making clear We need this data.
I read it on Sunday It's about transparency, but one thing I don't feel is in here is actually talking about transparency of where this money goes So. It's not just this money needs to come to our local community We need to make sure that where the money does go wherever it goes, we know where it goes, and so, if there's a way that you know the first resolve that was the first resolve Let me see that we are we asking for community specific data by race, gender ethnicity, who receives Kobe related funding both now and into the future.
I said resolve that community boards well Matt had worked with stakeholders to ensure community business are informed with kohli related funding opportunities, because that was another thing that someone said was Steve and I believe other people So fewer people, wanted to make sure we added in there and I'm, adding in the issue the need we're asking for support for the excluded workers.
