It's to really know that, so we can respond, and so one of the things the resolution asks is for the various federal state and local Covid-19 related small business funding programs to provide our community with community specific data by race, gender and ethnicity.
I would like us to just acknowledge, what's happening right now in our community and New York and just sort of you know open it.
We are have witnessed some really horrendous things in terms of police, violence and other types of violence, the rash at black people, black men, and we want to just acknowledge that it's happening a lot of people- businesses, as we were discussing before we started, are in our community of dealing with this, because we have, you know, sort of fringe things going on like lutein and other that's impacting small business.
, so we're going to start with Cirillo moranto from 8:09, and we are, you know we as part of our Business Development committee, for those who might be joining us from the community.
I. Think you guys know that I'm be part of this community for 45 years, just some diamonds alone , I've been 35 years since I opened up my first business, which is which was the grocery store and the corner grocery store diamond and a Nagar Avenue.
I'm planning to stay to stay in my neighborhood, but things are getting rid of rough I do not know if I want to be able to go to do what I used to do to you know to stay at stable to stay in business, , I, do not think we're going to check and rate that money I mean the revenue that you used to do it in order to to keep up with the with the sensor.
Eight or nine doing what I love to, which is, you know, be with my name, my neighborhood, my people, but things are getting like a little concerning its concerned me a lot.
You know you call him a burg, the wearing political So city, no question, though yes, yeah , raised a great point and brought a great resolution for where we're looking to figure out ways of directly tackling a lot of the issues and concerns that you raised Tanya, and we could speak on ways of being able to incorporate even his test testimony to be able to give more validity to the claims that we're making in the resolution and give it more life.
I know that they're looking for a lot of places, especially in the heights, has anyone reached out to you to maybe use your or rent your space for testing, not no more habit.
I. Think Domingo, you right on that, because you know we are we all brothers and sister, and now we as a small business, you know we were coming from most of these pieces.
It's, going to cost me Allah, and We do not make we're not making the money to in order to to not even to think up in our eight or nine It's a large space That's why I had I did not even bother OpenOffice or, like you said, for us, a bar or drink, so I am doing it acrosss the street got it no booze.
If you have any suggestions, but I think one of the areas that seems that collectively we cut we've come to an agreement, it's with the whole being able to identify temporary uses for these spaces in order to generate revenue so that we could be able to alleviate the burden once the business has to reopen And I think like Nobles stated, potentially using these as testing sites for both antibodies and for the virus seems to be.
People are retail, to do curbside and things like that, and who knows, we might be in that phase for a few weeks, and then we will get to the phase of restaurants I believe it's phase, two from what I saw the last thing I saw on the governor's press conference, But I believe there were restrictions, they're going to be restrictions like it could be capacity, and then outdoor They're, looking at allowing people to use outdoor space, You know when it's time to reopen, and there will need to be steps taken to help these businesses to get to that point, Thank, you so much city, low.
Who's- been immigration lawyer or has a very broad understanding of immigration with I felt like what's interesting to know What people have to understand is you might be undocumented in this country, but you can't incorporate a business and once you get that a Ibn number, you can actually make money.
Angela, but that's what I'm trying to say like there's ways around it, and it's just about understanding the laws and being able to make sure that our community benefits and we find those gray areas, because if corporations could avoid paying taxes, we should be able to help our people get the proper recognition, CD low.
Fortunately enough, you were the only test, the small business testimony today, because everybody is busy putting up the la Medida and crying play will apply no windows, And. The great thing is just know that we're working Tonya Bonner has a great resolution that we will make sure is reflective and that our voices are heard.
Thank you, for you know, for the invitation to participate in the committee meeting before I go into an update for the recurring legislation for small business communication.
But I know that he mentioned the just the Paycheck protection program, but there are other loans that are available to small businesses that are not related to the paid to paychecks and he left because they're actually putting up the plywood in his business as we speak.
A lot of businesses in our community are not being approved for these loans, but you know I like to hear more about what the situation is, whether they you know he applied and did not get it Give me.
It seems like we're going to have to start canvassing and figuring out what the current state of some small businesses are.
But a bank is supposed to provide more services to our community than just a storefront or just a quick access to their corporate banks, and that's something that I feel like we do have to question, because it seems like there's a difference, the differentiation in relationship when it comes to businesses, downtown and businesses in Washington Heights and the uptown areas of Harlem, Washington Heights in word, and the Bronx As a committee is what role do banks have in our community and it is it just face.
If not so, I want to highlight for him and for and for the committee Is that there are a couple of legislations that were recently in not enacted at the council from Rivera and Adams and they are in relations to businesses, and you know personal liability for provision of provisions of leases, and you know against the harassment of commercial tenants.
Is there anything being currently drafted or in the talks around like potentially having some sort of local city as BA, SBS, bail out or reopening packages for small businesses?
That's able to be allotted for the reopening back of the city and identifying particularly communities that have a and like Tonya's resolution, is addressing a certain amount of vacancy storefronts right.
Know, of this crisis, I mean small businesses are hurting a lot and now, with everything that is happening in the last couple of days, You know: negotiating environment for landlords and lease holders, and another thing that I was forgetting about the bill that is also being added to the to the bill is to create a pilot program for restaurants, and you know some other small businesses like pharmacies to participate with city programs that offer you know, discounts or some types of services to seniors.
At that time you know, I, really do understand what the value of a dollar is when it comes to opening up a small business, and it just broke my heart to see the images that we saw last night in the Bronx I.
New Yorkers is better than helping no New Yorkers, but I honestly feel that I'm personally, tired of settling for the crumbs that are put on our tables and not being able to deliver for our communities robust packages of legislation that is actually going to prevent evictions.
It was a very hard vote for me, because I do believe that in this time of economic hardship, we got ta help people we have to help them, and if one constituent in my district receives$ 600 a month for three months, it's better than zero dollars for three months, but I just feel that as a whole, if we're not in this together and when I'm holding the line, together, we're going to continue to settle for crumbs and so obviously bringing it back around to small businesses.
More on time, as you know, who owns 8:09 and Syria, was in a hole before the pandemic hit, because the lowest thing that he does not as a month for the renovate all nine and how Could he possibly without making any money, continue to keep his doors open right and this And so I'm disappointed in that I'm going to keep working on.
So you know those are three areas where I think we still need to continue to work I'm going to continue to bring my voice forward I'm, not on the Economic Development committee, but I am on the banks.
And I think that workers are a big part of the work force and our small businesses is the excluded worker fund.
We, have the support of over 50 coalition, orgs and unions, and we're like moving the conversation forward to make sure that some of our workers and our communities can benefit from some of this.
I'm, going to open it up for questions , okay, We had a conversation around banks right, And, I, think what people we were working on an event wave with somebody woman that Arosa around doing like what folks need to know about banks and not it just being face value for what is the purpose What are the expectations that the community should have on these banks?
It's, extremely important to be able to know Are the importance of what are the roles of banks within our community and what does it mean to have a branch within the community because a branch is supposed to serve as a connection to the to the entity, not What benefits are you bringing to the community in which that branch is located and You was talking about all these different ways that we can tax and raise money and funds for future issues with pandemic and small businesses.
The wrongs that have been inflicted in our community or not put made right made whole because it's unfair, like, for example, Had a white man come and see me And, he was the owner of all of a corporation that operates in another state where Marijuana has been legalized.
We need to be the ones that are making the decisions for these companies to come forward, and so that wealth can be kept in our community and grow, because when you eat the people around you eat and most likely.
One thing that we could incorporate is: What does it look like to work with a community beyond face value and that's something within itself:?
We will work together, I'll reach out to Orlando I'll, see everybody in the committee so that we can move forward on the conversation around banking and being able to develop the standard of what thank you came within our community The preparation happening on the state.
The future instances of looting so sadly closes Hi. Carmen I missed most of your presentation, because I was at the Columbia Cove aid community update, I wanted to know, and your other life is working on mental health, who is studying the mental health and public health implications of the legalization.
Agreements are where the developer agrees to pay for a study to understand the recreational needs of a community and also fund, whatever the study produces, which could be certain equipment in parks, creation of parts creation of a community center that people can use one of the things that I wanted to go a little bit do a little bit deeper dive on is: What's considered, the largest community benefits agreement in the country, and this was agreed to in December of 2004 in Los, Angeles and so I'm, going to just read off a couple of the details, because I mean ultimately in the end.
So, if somebody's going to come to our community and part of business, development, is also being able to make sure that we leverage these developments to be able to meet the needs of our community, but also the means of local businesses.
We have to stop thinking about the crumbs and start realizing that when folks want to make money off of our community, there should be a standard that the helps and works with everybody, including our small businesses and certain guarantees.
The great thing about the Community board is that it actually does have a lot of diverse voices, and you know It's just so important to reiterate that when you have diverse voices around the table, then you get.
Even certain individuals that have that are tapped in there are these folks that are informal leaders that are tapped into the community And, so I think it just takes someone taking you know leadership and saying we got to make sure that these voices are at the table as well and just and did not just create a process for that We won't have those kinds of problems with community benefit.
Just for banking and the type of business that you know what you think We definitely need something separate about.
One of the things that you know when we return to whatever our new normal is that I'll continue to work on is getting the leadership of whatever these branches that we have available, either on the full, seven or Dyckman, or in wood, Washington Heights to come out and actually support, because we do not see a lot of a lot of banks in small community.
How do we, you know, use this not only to empower ourselves or empower more people that are like us to be in positions where we can actually make decisions now, This particular resolution I would say:?
We want to make sure that this community, that it is a targeted thing that we, that whomever, is offering cofee related small business funding for rebuilding, that we want to make sure that is targeted towards communities like ours, where there's a large minority and immigrant population, and that would include not only just the bank relationship.
He leads the efforts at Apple bank on 181St Street and he's also a resource being able to provide information as to like, because I consider Apple Bank Apple back as a community bank right, correct, senex, Yes, I mean we only have some branches food work, but we're not a big corporate we're not publicly owned, so we're not public, so or family owned, ok, perfect and just feel free to chime in anything else.
I said resolve that community boards well Matt, had worked with stakeholders to ensure community business are informed with Kohli related funding opportunities, because that was another thing that someone said was Steve And I believe other people.
Is there anything else that people think we you know should be in here before we see if we're going to vote on it?
I just want to make sure that it emphasizes that our community is made up overwhelmingly of small businesses, not national chain stores or major stores, and it's the small businesses such as in communities like ours, that need to help the most You know.
So in it did, you know emphasize how communities like ours are uniquely impacted by this pandemic.
We have a history of communicating like we should just we have to do roll call right, since this is virtual, Yes, I, know Christina, yes, definitely and welcome to the committee.
