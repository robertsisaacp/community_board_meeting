Well at least may I just interred for a second It's open to the public They will also be currently listening to youtube Manhattan training series, so it is always going to conflict with somebody's meeting somewhere right, but I think this is the second time in particular that the land use one conflict.
We have the april minutes so we're going to have to approve those first right, So I make a motion that we approve the april minutes and I'll have the june the may minutes next month, next meeting any nays, any abstentions, No all in favor on the chairs report , There's many things to do, but I'm gonna now take this opportunity to do something to what I think is priority, which is a presentation spare headed and quarterbacked by our chair of dnt david avian on a department of transportation, citibank, presentation on how they're moving forward with their their future and appliances.
I'm, the Manhattan deputy borough commissioner, at the new york city, department of transportation and I wanted to thank community board 12 for hosting us tonight.
Like I said I'm gonna go through an abbreviated presentation hitting some hitting some important facts about the expansion of city bike up into washington heights and inwood Just generally, what is city bike city bike is new york, city's bike share system and it's a private public partnership.
We expect to install city bike stations in the southern half of the board, so from 155th street right up until 184th street That would accomplish about 30 stations and later we're going to come back and finish off the rest of the community board, only up to 220th street You can see this map the reason why we we're doing this is we want to create this sort of contiguous equal service area across Manhattan and and the Bronx We created a draft plan for station locations within Manhattan community board 12 and the two main sort of considerations are our own planning and technical, siding guidelines and community outreach, and, as jennifer mentioned, we presented this plan to the traffic and transportation committee on june 1st, so public outreach there's a couple of sort of facets of it.
There are no and at the same time we had a online feedback portal map open for about a month and a half actually is closer to two months and people were again able to drop in pins and say: yes, you know I want to see a city bike station here or no, and in addition to that, we have stakeholder meetings with places such as the new york port author, the new york, new jersey, port authority, different parks, NYCHA facilities to make sure that their input is taken into account as well.
So, like I said we combined all that outreach and our citing guidelines and made this draft plan, of which we presented to community board 12 the transportation committee It's available right now on our website, nycgov spikeshare the maps and plans tab and you can just scroll down until you see Manhattan community board, 12 One is contacting jennifer and her folks at the Manhattan borough commissioner's office numbers right.
Who were able to provide pictures and very specific feedback that will be sort of one area, So I understand people are going to want to talk tonight but know that I have captured.
But people should rest assured that if you've already provided impact information that I have that So, we have a bunch of questions in the chat that relate to noise and traffic and stuff Let people know that there that those issues will be addressed later in the agenda and the district managers report in the different committee reports We're just focused on this item, but we will get to those things, one other procedural question: How do people sign up for the public session because I or whoever's the host?
So first is the sea little followed by danielle Thank , you hi jesse a great work on the presentation and even better job in minimizing the impact on the local parking spots So when we met other committee, I emphasize the fact that you know this has to be accessible and to the points that I raised where that accessibility.
Secondly instructions also be should be displayed in spanish It's, a spanish, my speaking community That needs to have the attention of everyone and I'm sure that you know you will come through that because I don't think it's difficult, but the most important thing is obviously the fact that we need to have equal access and provide some type of options where clients can buy some type of cards and have access to the bikes.
The first thing, I want to say: is: I was on the traffic and transportation committee for almost two years, and I was unaware that this was an upcoming project in the neighborhood So, that's the first thing , I wanted to say: I was wondering what the impact of city bike if you've looked into this at all, what the impact has been on local businesses specifically bike businesses, because we do have one in on dikeman So I'm wondering how this is going to impact parking, sidewalks and two other quick things, I'm wondering for people that might not have credit cards what options there are for those folks, I actually am a bike rider recently with Covid-19 to preserve my mental health You might take to help with safety in the neighborhood just because it is a very busy and congested area.
Some of it could be like they just don't have space in their tiny new york city apartment, The other thing about safety in in washington heights, and one thing that we did mention during the community meeting is we have this mayor de Blasio announced in 2019 this green wave initiative and that is to increase bicycle infrastructure, not only in you know not only in bike share expansion areas, but throughout the five boroughs, and that includes you, know physical infrastructure and education of the best rule.
I, really appreciate you and taking the time to speak with us couple questions how much parking is being sacrificed for these city bikes, one two when you guys get together and discuss the communities that you guys are trying to be active in how much conversation is surrounded around need.
I believe the number that was sort of estimated back in the in the transportation committee was I believe roughly around 60, but we're still sort of trying to balance all the needs of the community You just provide the split between sidewalk stations and street locations for the and how many total are in this proposal?
I believe there's 15, sidewalk and 13 road bed or I just want to make sure that the two stations that are more there that we have been discussing 157th street and 184th street I, saw you debbie that at the last meeting on june 1st that we are going to put like a group of people together that live around our area, you know near those areas to make recommendations and to see how we could really make it make plan.
My concern is more around What's, going to be what's going to be done in 184th street and beyond 181st street, because I'm, assuming that dlt already canvassed that area, but there's a big set like there's a lot of restaurants and and dining areas which already limit the amount of parking spaces for the community so being taking further more I , think would be, will create a sort of catastrophic, very chaotic area.
So they one thing to know is that, yes, they do get cleaned every so often when a maintenance person has to go fix a bike or when they're parked adjacent to hospitals such as the one on 169th street and and fort washington avenue The city has been working with lyft to sort of proactively, monitor and try to combat the spread of Covid-19, and let me see the first I think he's saying that the requirements for businesses to cling to the process of kobe are not the same as the one that you've been explaining, since you were at the committee level.
Well I think I believe that I did answer the question about kovid and the kind of the cleanliness that the bikes go through, but in terms of the first sort of parking question I can let jennifer answer that, certainly, and in regard you know, we can try to get additional clarification as to what additional measures lyft is taking for cleaning That kind of outlines their practices to stop the spread, but it's up to us, Four that the city doh, you know, like the department of health, tries to share right.
The department of parks and recreation informed at the district service cabinet meeting that four swimming pools will be open in Manhattan during the summer, but not high bridge swimming pool, because this site is being used as a coffee, 19 testing center, the asia raid, the department of human administration, informed that they are replacing all the air conditioners over five years to the people that are in the program receiving air conditioner by age or eight I want to let everybody know that the office, the community board 12, has a facebook page.
I think it's extremely important ebenezer when you have information like that to share with businesses that you actually communicate with folks who chair these committees, you know so that we could try to potentially send an email out or add it to the agenda and as far as the bus lane goes , is there anything happening where, like a community conversation about it and that's the fight, because, as we know, we have representatives here from dot, but there seems to be a certain level of cohesion when we work with them and the mess that they leave is for us to deal with while they move on to another messy project.
because it's the entrance and the exit to the from the borough coin to the Bronx and diverting the traffic around is a big mess and we are concerned soon that the very first moment we have the news I think it was either at the most recent executive committee meeting or it might have been last month's board meeting We were discussing cb12s facebook and youtube channels, and it was pointed out that when you send out the emails, those links are available at the bottom of the email and we discussed sending you know all the board members or the republican general, an email just reminding them that if they scroll down to the bottom of the email they can access and subscribe to community boards.
In the first week of march workers at five new york city, restaurants, went on strike after chipotle managers, pressured workers to work sick with coronavirus symptoms, despite the mounting crisis of the pandemic, and studies that have come out since then show that there were likely already thousands of coronavirus cases in new york city By. That point we only recently learned of these license applications and, unfortunately, missed the june committee meeting, which is why we're here tonight, and so for all of the reasons mentioned.
We ask that community board 12 oppose chipotle's application for restaurant wine licenses at 3781, broadway and 4240 broadway The next, one up next public speaker and then that'll You know wrap it up right because I have another important speaker to come.
This is happening on hillside avenue and also a lot of marijuana smoking on the corner of hillside avenue in elwood, So I'm, not sure why all of those folks didn't raise their hands to speak during the public session, but I felt that for our board members who may not be monitoring the chat, it's important for them to have the benefit of knowing that these are some of the questions and concerns that the public is raising Thank you for all the work we're gonna have now Manhattan borough Thank you because it was really helpful and people seem to enjoy it, and we need to keep working on that.
and so we obviously have more almost double of anybody else and so on are more relevant in Manhattan than anywhere else Tomorrow morning, the mayor is putting up a portal, as my understanding listing all the restaurants that I just mentioned in terms of the numbers, mapped and searchable in different ways: Number two, the issue that liz ritter just brought up and that I hear about every single community board is this tension between the need for the restaurants and the question of what they could or could not do, etc.
People can use the bathroom of the establishment I'm on the governor's recovery task force that came up at the town hall last night The answer is absolutely yes, but what the city is thinking of doing and thinking of is the word that I was told, is a mediation process for restaurants that are having challenges and where there are complaints and supposedly to use oath or a private organization called jams which I probably should know, but don't and apparently they're willing to do the mediation for free, so community boards need to be absolutely front and center as community board.
You know it is a non-profit house in our office that focuses on data Of course, I want every restaurant to do well and we can have a further discussion, but that's the very quick version also on data I know that housing is utmost of importance to community board 12 and all of us without getting into the wonderful work.
They have the lab to be able to analyze our waste here in the city of new york, not send it to California and stanford You know the mayor cut the pickup in the budget, but we are pushing at least have one organics drop off per community board, because if we lose that momentum again, it goes right to the landfill Lots of people did sign up.
Think it's great in terms of your public I certainly want to work with miss rojas about her concern about what's going on in her neighborhood and, of course, all the other issues that you brought up thanks , You wait until the public speakers are finished so that you can hear exactly what's going on Hopefully, you guys have the time to read them over As usual licensing is usually the black ship of the family.
Being that, as things are beginning to as businesses is starting to reopen to be able to start advocating for equitable processes in which we could but support our local businesses, whether it be via lenders or etc, but just make making sure that we're able to provide equitable access to communities of color within new york city, specifically district 12 Do people have any questions or friendly amendments or anything that they would like to add or comment about before.
I left with the understanding that as a community, we must advocate for more garbage bins within our parks, but also being able to figure out how to have the community members also engage with anybody who they feel is doing something that is out of out of that would impact the area, but also letting folks know that this neighborhood carrying effect of being able to call the police and falsely accuse people was, is not going to be tolerated.
It is essentially referring to a language that was previously voted on and supports, making sure that we are allocating money in the city's budget so as to ensure that we're providing any refugees that are potentially moved to new york city as a result of the federal government's responses you know so as to get essentially aid Thank you at home, okay, thank you, quick question or observation scenario or two of them going through the resolution.
Since, it's in a c8 district, the board of standards and appeals has to issue a special permit and, as I pointed out in the past, I think it was 10 years ago , The community board passed a resolution asking the department of city planning to in fact rezone most or all c8 The special permit would not be needed.
So we can add additional language to clarify You, know expectations, but I do think it was important to just move forward with the resolution because it was discussed in committee and our committee voted so I don't want to make a decision to not write it after we had already voted on it at our community level, right, So, I, guess to my second part of my question: Would, it not make sense to add language to resolution, acknowledging the actions that have already been taken along the lines of what we're supporting?
The family is not asking that you know it's a very challenging charging charge time for all of us and I think we are all learning new details about everything that's going on in the community, including the you know, the fireworks and other issues each day, everything's changing.
It's too easy to say that social workers and counselors and outreach staff can replace the police officers I agree that they shouldn't have to respond to deal with homeless issues and mental health disorders Steve I'm very reluctant to support it So you have an opportunity to vote yes or no, so whatever, , I guess these ideas have come up several times on the board, but also there are many non-profits Thank you, the actual budget.
We 're saying simply that you know there are a lot of other issues also happening in our community, and we know that, as our Manhattan board president mentioned earlier, there are going to be issues as we go back to school and cutting education for that amount of money and not considering a larger cut for the NYPD is not justice, so we're advocating for just a more equitable allocation of funding, we're not trying to do a disservice to and our agency That is not our goal of this resolution.
I wanted to ask mr chair for the office staff that, when we send out a notice about to change the method of operations that this be more specific, in the sense that, if you're going to ask for the committee to request or to allow perhaps a dj karaoke, that this be stated because oftentimes, it's just in general terms, about math operations, and that covers a lot of different items.
We would like the staff to be more specific when we send out the public notice, but you know we can work with them So. As you stated, we have resolutions for march that were passed by committee, but not by the general board meeting We had some renews most of our renewals new licenses, some withdrawals when we requested stipulations, as we usually do that they be brought to the office.
All right, Sort of the my agenda does not have the resolutions from march It's true that it would have been very helpful if they had come to the committee meeting, but without addressing whatever are the labor issues.
So the two asked there the first ask was to approve the enclosure of the patio and, if that will be approved the patio enclosure, they will come back to the community report to request specific hours for the patio, okay, very good and number 17 This is 18 for march Can, you you're, sorry actually 16 for march That's something that the office can work with and making sure that you get set.
I, don't know if I'll have time to vote on these resolutions, questions ones, questions We had many community board.
No on june 8 abstain on march 17, yes to the rest steve , he has a question: okay, not voting on b, due to conflict since I work for the city parks, department, abstaining on f and abstaining on six and voting no on eight switch six june 6 or march 6 june voting no on eight and yes to everything, including all of the march resolutions, so you're not voting due to conflict on b I am going to abstain on d.
As far as I know to reiterate that this will be a large community meeting not only with cb12, but all the stakeholders, including elected offices, businesses, You, know a sort of public input of all kinds This is ebenezer to just people understand the chair and ebenezer We have so many of our community board members on ballots tonight, guys we're gonna finish our meeting with one last first item: I was just looking at the first Please spread the word People in your buildings who may be in need right now we're giving away substantial boxes of dried goods and fresh produce, and it's something that we hope to start this thursday and continue going forward and the one thing that hasn't been discussed as much today.
What I would like to say as well that the controller has a Covid-19 resource guide that we continue to add information on that 's in several different languages, including spanish, bangla and urdu, which I know our languages that are spoken around So. and I also wanted to say that we had a tenants rights forum or a few of them in which people got to ask questions to a legal aid attorney this summer , We're planning a few of virtual events as well as a pride event and I'll get back to you with the details, but also too, we are going to have a few meetings regarding to a specific community If anyone out that's on the community board call deals with immigrant communities in different ways.
a beautiful trail that leads across high bridge into the Bronx folks are riding those motorized vehicles down that the trail that's there and across the bridge into the Bronx, and there also there's also that sidewalk right next to harlem river drive down by the water The same thing is happening, so I just want to flag that so that we can open up a conversation not now, but during a during the next committee meeting for either parks or public safety, because I do think that something needs to be addressed in that regard.
That is one of the things that we spoke about briefly, and we will be addressing again just want to make a very important announcement to everybody on this, and thank you for reminding me if you see anything hinky going on with these go rebels It to support Go revelcom, send it to the company when the company sees that their vehicles are being used in violation of new york city law that it's being used in a park that is being used on a sidewalk that it's being used to go the wrong way down a one-way street I mean sure it's an enforcement issue, but if go revel has information on the improper use of their vehicles.
