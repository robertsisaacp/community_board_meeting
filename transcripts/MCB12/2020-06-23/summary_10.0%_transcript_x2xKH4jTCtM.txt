So it is always going to conflict with somebody's meeting somewhere right, But I think this is the second time in particular that the land use one conflict.
Everyone and hello, I'm jennifer santenez, I'm, the Manhattan deputy borough, commissioner, at the new york city department of transportation, and I wanted to thank community board 12 for hosting us.
Are you gonna, be able to set jessie up to share this video we're working on that we're working, on?, Like, I, said, I'm gonna go through an abbreviated presentation hitting some hitting some important facts about the expansion of city bike up into washington heights and inwood.
That would accomplish about 30 stations and later we're going to come back and finish off the rest of the community board, only up to 220th street.
We generally like to add larger stations adjacent to large destination, a very popular destination such as transit hubs or supermarkets, or things like that, where there's going to be a lot more foot, traffic and generally smaller ones in residential areas and the actual sighting of the station Other things we have to consider, such as utilities, manholes street furniture, trees, sidewalk width, to make sure that nothing really gets impeded.
So like I said, we combined all that outreach and our citing guidelines and made this draft plan, of which we presented to community board 12 the transportation committee.
It's available right now on our website, nyc.gov spikeshare, the maps and plans tab, and you can just scroll down until you see Manhattan community board, 12 One is contacting jennifer and her folks at the Manhattan borough commissioner's office numbers There We can synthesize everything and make sure that we have a plan that best works for the community with installationing happening later this summer, and, like I, said that was a quick abbreviated version.
Anybody from the public obviously can go direct to D.O.T. Know: eli really wants to move the agenda And I hope people already did- that the hottest station and the only one that there were two that had issues in particular and number one on that list was a station that you'll see on the map at west 157th.
There's a variety of reasons: Why a number of board members, and thanks to maria luna, curtis wayne, etc, who were able to provide pictures and very specific feedback that will be sort of one area.
So I, understand people are going to want to talk tonight but know that I have captured.
I certainly do have that second station at 181st in cabrini We've had a number of people comment on that station and our first vice chair, I, certainly open it to questions, but people should rest assured that if you've already provided impact information that I have, that So, we have a bunch of questions in the chat that relate to noise and traffic and stuff.
Let people know that there that those issues will be addressed later in the agenda and the district managers report in the different committee.
The first thing, I want to say: is: I was on the traffic and transportation committee for almost two years, and I was unaware that this was an upcoming project in the neighborhood, and I didn't hear about any of those meetings that were opportunities to provide feedback.
Some of it could be like they just don't have space in their tiny new york city apartment, The other thing about safety in in washington heights, and one thing that we did mention during the community meeting is we have this mayor de Blasio announced in 2019 this green wave initiative and that is to increase bicycle infrastructure,?
I really appreciate you and taking the time to speak with us couple questions how much parking is being sacrificed for these city bikes, one two when you guys get together and discuss the communities that you guys are trying to be active in how much conversation is surrounded around need.
I, saw you debbie that at the last meeting on June 1st that we are going to put like a group of people together that live around our area, you know near those areas to make recommendations and to see how we could really make it make plan.
The community parking is a You. Know, is a problem in our you know, difficult community, and I think that we were supposed to be having a meeting, something like tomorrow.
If they listen to us, because I mean we are the ones that live around here in this you know, the vicinity of the 157th street We have we're community board, and our committee received this.
Is that while this isn't a resolution item, the community board comments from our community board, members will go back to DOT in a consolidated form, so I'm sort of Let me interject, I, think that we all here been long enough to understand that the process is that suggestions and recommendations go to the committee The committee.
I want to know, since lyft is running this, if people, especially because we have many lower income, people in community board 12.
What's going to be, what's going to be done in 184th street and beyond 181st street, because I'm, assuming that dlt already canvassed that area, but there's a big set Like there's a lot of restaurants and and dining areas which already limit the amount of parking spaces for the community so being taking further more , I think, would be, will create a sort of catastrophic, very chaotic, area.
So I would like to know the breakdown of parking spaces being lost north of 181st street We. Don't have any sort of plans for north of 184th street right, now.
I just really wanted from a process standpoint to let people know how they're going to get on the public session.
Well, I think I believe that I did answer the question about Covid-19 and the kind of the cleanliness that the bikes go through, but in terms of the first sort of parking question, I can let jennifer answer that, certainly, and in regard you know, we can try to get additional clarification as to what additional measures lyft is taking for cleaning.
Four that the city doh, you know, like the department of health, tries to share right.
And I, believe the mayor's office and the police department in general are working to find out the way to stop how to bring the firework to the city of new york.
The department of transportation have more questions than answers at this time from the district manager and these go guidelines and we'll continue having some meetings.
You know the details of how the boss way going to be implemented at 101st street, the department of parks and recreation informed at the district service cabinet meeting that four swimming pools will be open in Manhattan during the summer, but not high, bridge swimming pool, because this site is being used as a coffee, 19 testing center, the asia raid, the department of human administration, informed that they are replacing all the air conditioners over five years to the people that are in the program receiving air conditioner by age or eight.
I want to let everybody know that the office, the community board 12, has a facebook.
I think it's extremely important ebenezer when you have information like that to share with businesses that you actually communicate with folks who chair these committees, you know so that we could try to potentially send an email out or add it to the agenda and as far as the bus lane goes Where, like a community conversation about it, And, that's the fight because, as we know.
We were discussing cb12s facebook and youtube channels, and it was pointed out that when you send out the emails, those links are available at the bottom of the email and we discussed sending you know all the board members or the republican general, an email just reminding them that if they scroll down to the bottom of the email they can access and subscribe to community boards.
I am forwarding to both you and ebenezer a report that our transportation policy- analyst paul, wrote right after that last minute, DOT, meeting summarizing it and providing the relevant links so that you can share it with the entire board.
My first started your community board meeting, and I really appreciate that you guys hosting me today, I'm, bringing up a situation that going on in our neighborhood, I, live by 107th street between broadway and for washington, and the only situation around our neighborhood is out of control.
I was walking to go to work around seven something in the morning and the homeless, people even using the drugs on the street, you know, and even getting high.
Seiu 32bj, represents approximately one in every 100 adults in new york city, including more than 2 800, who live or work here in community board.
And for the last year and a half we've supported chipotle workers here in new york, city, struggling to better their working conditions.
In the first week of March workers at five new york, city, restaurants, went on strike after chipotle managers, pressured workers to work sick with coronavirus symptoms, despite the mounting crisis of the pandemic, and studies that have come out since then show that there were likely already thousands of coronavirus cases in new york, city.
They haven't been following a lot of the requirements and just implementing basic things like sneeze guards to protect workers, and they also have like a lot of other outstanding issues related to fair work, week, laws as well, and basically you know that you know She's lives in her neighborhood She needs to protect herself and her family and her community I.
I have extra time, since she was doing translation in spanish, because if I had a double time, or at least like an additional minute or something like that- I, don't know if that's in the rules, but given the fact that we're not providing translation as a community board.
So I'm, not sure why all of those folks didn't raise their hands to speak during the public session, but I felt that for our board members who may not be monitoring the chat, it's important for them to have the benefit of knowing that these are some of the questions and concerns that the public is raising.
So, all the questions that I know is on everybody's mind: How is this going to work Are more relevant in Manhattan than anywhere else.
Number two: The issue that liz ritter just brought up and that I hear about every single community board People can use the bathroom of the establishment, I'm on the governor's recovery task force that came up at the town hall last night.
The answer is absolutely yes, but what the city is thinking of doing and thinking of is the word that I was told, is a mediation process for restaurants that are having challenges and where there are complaints and supposedly to use oath or a private organization called jams which I probably should know, but don't So community boards need to be absolutely front and center, as community board.
I know that housing is utmost of importance to community board 12 and all of us without getting into the wonderful work.
You know, the mayor, cut the pickup in the budget, but we are pushing at least have one organics drop off per community board, because if we lose that momentum again, it goes right to the landfill.
This was a resolution that was brought forward by tanya, and the committee made some modifications and we felt that it was prudent being that, as things are beginning to, as businesses is starting to reopen to be able to start advocating for equitable processes in which we could but support our local businesses, whether it be via lenders or etc, but just make making sure that we're able to provide equitable access to communities of color within new york, city, specifically district 12.
You do yes, steve in the fifth, whereas I would like to suggest that instead of saying inadequate, that you should say inappropriate and and that you should indicate due to soil, contamination, slope, park, alienation and accessibility issues and then end the, whereas clause at that point, because I don't believe that the money had was ever transferred to d.o.e. And I don't have that screen open, but that sounds perfectly reasonable.
Think I would like to commend liz, because, if folks didn't participate in that meeting, you would see what being somebody who brought everybody together and developed a constructive way of being able to take negative situations and not let community members go against each other, but identify issues and figure out how to commonly attack them.
I left with the understanding that as a community, we must advocate for more garbage bins within our parks, but also being able to figure out how to have the community members also engage with anybody who they feel is doing something that is out of out of that would impact the area, but also letting folks know that this neighborhood, carrying effect of being able to call the police and falsely accuse people.
There's been a lot of information on facebook lately about you, know, people posting photographs of parks that are strewn with garbage like totally trashed, and then there are literally hundreds of comments.
She, is currently actually looking to go back and work with some of the members of the lgbt task force so to try and make sure that it is, you know, even more further inclusive of other language that we would like to have included in the future.
The committee was really just looking forward to try and pass a resolution once we've gotten, you know a bit more feedback from the lgbt task force.
You know I'm looking forward to that, and hopefully just the entire board will be looking forward to have hopefully having a bit more of a conversation on what kind of communication we'd like to have being used across the entire board and secondly We spoke a bit about the excluded worker relief fund, which has since then changed the name to billionaire mark to market tax.
So We, of course want you to please review and let us know what you think of this individual resolution.
I think a lot of people have realized that it is, quite frankly, not gonna, present many of the resolutions that we would like to see, and I think that there's a bit more of a conversation needs to be had in regards to the passage of such legislation.
It is essentially referring to a language that was previously voted on and supports, making sure that we are allocating money in the city's budget so as to ensure that we're providing any refugees that are potentially moved to new york city as a result of the federal government's responses you know so as to get essentially aid.
In the event that happens, we saw that in the aftermath of hurricane maria that had left a number of recently resettled refugees and immigrants seeking opportunities that were not necessarily being made available, and so this is just continuing that kind of work that we've already presented prior to everyone, and we just want to make sure that everyone is aware that this is now going to be essentially passed for this board.
Just whatever you're saying just add it as a, whereas to the resolution, okay, all right and being that it's okay I think it sounds as if we're going to have to just make a vote, because it's an amendment.
The resolution The only thing point I want to make is this: New verbiage has to be done tonight because we actually have to vote on the actual words tonight.
The community board passed a resolution asking the department of city planning to in fact, rezone, most or all c8.
The board of standards and appeals will not issue a special permit until you know both dep and dht provide their sign offs at the June committee.
You know project further and voted to support the special permit, and you know noting a number of things that you know the school already exists in the community.
We asked in supporting it that the applicants you know continue to coordinate with the committees of the community board as the project moves forward as it as activities at the site begin in terms of construction, then, as they get ready to occupy it, and we also ask that they coordinate with you know, local, nearby community-based organizations, of which there are a couple that are literally next door as well as small businesses and the you know the washington heights bid as they you know, as they are moving to 181st street.
This is obviously another one of those issues that is a byproduct of what's been happening around the country, as people begin to think about reimagining public safety reimagining, our community policing, we're not advocating for a lack of resources, we're advocating for budget equity, and we really believe that there's a way to you know to support our community Maintain public safety, with a certain amount of money and being cut from the budget.
You, know expectations, but I do think it was important to just move forward with the resolution because it was discussed in committee and our committee voted.
Thank you for all the work you've been doing and and for doing two resolutions, and probably fifty There's a lot of public safety issues.
You know it's a very challenging charging charge time for all of us, and I think we are all learning new details about everything that's going on in the community, including the you know, the fireworks and other issues, each day I just got an email earlier today from the precincts, I'm very happy with the work and the partnership that we have built with our precinct captain in the 33rd.
We 're, saying simply that you know there are a lot of other issues also happening in our community.
We know that, as our Manhattan board president mentioned earlier, there are going to be issues as we go back to school and cutting education for that amount of money and not considering a larger cut for the NYPD Is, not justice, so We're advocating for just a more equitable allocation of funding, we're not trying to do a disservice to and our agency.
It's almost it's just kindly just to raise your hand and just wait for your turn, because I'm getting four five six people at the same time, speaking so Almost to the licensing committee, resolutions.
We would like the staff to be more specific when we send out the public notice, but you know we can work with them.
We have resolutions for March that were passed by committee, but not by the general board.
I, don't know if I'll have time to vote on these resolutions, questions.
I'm still talking a lot about food access for seniors and there seems to be quite a number of sources, but there are still issues, especially with people that are getting food delivered to them by the city.
Coming how to unmute myself, I am going to abstain on all of the March resolutions because I don't have access to them and yes to the rest, Tell me again.
Do you vote It is for March licensing no to 10 and 11, Yes to the rest on March, for the June agenda items no to number eight and He wants to vote.
Wait hold on a second June, I abstain from resolution d And, I vote, yes on c e and f.
Yes, I'm here I am abstaining from March 17 and I am voting no on June, 8 and He has a question: okay, not voting on b, due to conflict.
Since I work for the city parks, department, abstaining on f and abstaining on six and voting no on eight switch, six June 6 or March 6 June, okay, voting no on eight and yes to everything, including all of the March resolutions.
I am voting no in June number, eight and in support of the businesses coming back to our community.
The same thing is happening, so I just want to flag that so that we can open up a conversation, not now, but during a during the next committee meeting for either parks or public safety, because I do think that something needs to be addressed in that regard.
