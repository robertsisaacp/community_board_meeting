Can you email me the attendance sheet, please I, do not have that list going to may send it to you, I'm, going to look for that, but I do not have it right now , I'm, assuming that there are public members, some DOT presenters and some some other people that I can recognize, because I just see a bunch of numbers.
Everyone and hello, I'm Jennifer Santenez, I'm, the Manhattan deputy borough, commissioner, at the New York City Department of Transportation, and I wanted to thank Community Board 12 for hosting us tonight.
Thank you right, and that has been those links have been sent to the board, but also DOT T You can put the links in the in the Q&A also maybe for people to pick up thanks, and one thing to note is the one that we're sharing today Are you going to be able to set jessie up to share this video we're working on that we're working, on?
Thank you very much like I said, I'm, going to go through an abbreviated presentation hitting some hitting some important facts about the expansion of CitiBike up into Washington heights and Inwood.
One thing to note is that no city funds are used to operate citibike that comes from the users who pay to use this system If you see on this map that light blue area is the sort of first phase of citibike, which was in 2013 after that, a couple of years later into that royal blue area, we expanded into the upper West side of the east side into Queens for the first time and deeper into Brooklyn, and what we're in the middle of now is our phase three expansion that all that dark blue area that you see on the map, and that includes going into Brooklyn for the going to the Bronx for the first time, completing Manhattan and going deeper into neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens such as Corona elmer's in Queens and sunset park in Brooklyn.
That would accomplish about 30 stations and later we're going to come back and finish off the rest of the community board, only up to 220th Street.
We presented this plan to the traffic and transportation committee on June 1st, so public outreach there's a couple of sort of facets of it.
You know, I, want to see a CitiBike station here or no, and in addition to that, we have stakeholder meetings with places such as the New York port author, the New York New, Jersey, Port Authority, different parks, NYCHA facilities to make sure that their input is taken into account as well, and this is the more planning side of what we're looking for.
We generally like to add larger stations adjacent to large destination, a very popular destination such as transit hubs or supermarkets, or things like that, where there's going to be a lot more foot, traffic and generally smaller ones in residential areas and the actual sighting of the station There's other things we have to consider, such as utilities, manholes street furniture, trees, sidewalk width, to make sure that nothing really gets impeded.
So like I said, we combined all that outreach and our citing guidelines and made this draft plan, of which we presented to Community Board 12, the transportation, committee.
Gov spikeshare the maps and plans Tab, and you can just scroll down until you see Manhattan, Community, board, 12 One is contacting Jennifer and her folks at the Manhattan borough commissioner's office numbers right.
We can synthesize everything and make sure that we have a plan that best works for the community with installationing happening later this summer, and, like I, said that was a quick abbreviated.
: Eli really wants to move the agenda And I, hope people already did- that the hottest station and the only one that there were two that had issues in particular and number one on that list was a station that you'll see on the map at West.
157Th, there's a variety of reasons: Why a number of board members, and thanks to Maria, Luna, Curtis, Wayne, etc, who were able to provide pictures and very specific feedback that will be sort of one area.
So I, understand people are going to want to talk tonight but know that I have captured.
I certainly do have that second station at 181St in Cabrini , we've had a number of people comment on that station and our first vice chair, That included two other stations to comment on as well, so with that, I, certainly open it to questions, but people should rest assured that if you've already provided impact information that I have, that So, we have a bunch of questions in the chat that relate to noise and traffic and stuff.
Let people know that there that those issues will be addressed later in the agenda and The district managers report in the different committee reports do not think that we're ignoring you, even though we're not answering those questions right, now.
That needs to have the attention of everyone and I'm sure that you know you will come through that because I do not think it's difficult, but the most important thing is obviously the fact that we need to have equal access and provide some type of options where clients can buy some type of cards and have access to the bikes.
The first thing, I want to say: is: I was on the traffic and transportation committee for almost two years, and I was unaware that this was an upcoming project in the neighborhood, and I did not hear about any of those meetings that were opportunities to provide feedback.
Some of it could be like they just do not have space in their tiny, New, York, City apartment They do not want to deal with maintenance or You, know, bike shops and all this The other thing about safety in in Washington Heights, and one thing that we did mention during the community meeting is we have this mayor de Blasio announced in 2019 this green wave initiative and that is to increase bicycle infrastructure, not only in you know not only in bike share expansion areas, but throughout the five boroughs- And that includes you- know, physical infrastructure and education of the best rule, the rules in the road, the rules of the road.
The meeting that we had was in coordination with CB12 the outreach meeting, and on top of that, I, really appreciate you and taking the time to speak with us couple questions how much parking is being sacrificed for these CitiBikes one two, when you guys get together and discuss the communities that you guys are trying to be active in how much conversation is surrounded around need.
I believe the number that was sort of estimated back in the in the transportation committee, was, I believe, roughly around 60, but we're still sort of trying to balance all the needs of the community.
I, saw you debbie that at the last meeting on June 1st that we are going to put like a group of people together that live around our area, you know near those areas to make recommendations and to see how we could really make it make plan.
Not only the city but also The community parking is a You. Know, is a problem in our you know, difficult community, and I think that we were supposed to be having a meeting, something like tomorrow.
I think it's June 24 in the morning with something you know something like that, but I'm, trying to find my emails and my answers.
If they listen to us, because I mean we are the ones that live around here in this you know the vicinity of the 157Th street, plays and things like, so that so the question is: do.
I want to know, since Lyft is running this, if people, especially because we have many lower income, people in Community board 12, if there will be based on like the metro card status or some other indicator, that they will receive a reduced rate, because I believe the standard rate for a metro for a CitiBike is something like 90 a month which is not cheap.
What's, going to be, what's going to be done in 184Th, Street and beyond 181St Street, because I'm, assuming that DOT already canvassed that area, but there's a big set Like there's a lot of restaurants and and dining areas which already limit the amount of parking spaces for the community so being taking further more , I think, would be, will create a sort of catastrophic, very chaotic, area.
So I would like to know the breakdown of parking spaces being lost north of 181St Street We do not have any sort of plans for north of 184Th Street right, now.
I just really wanted from a process standpoint to let people know how they're going to get on the public session.
Well, I think I believe that I did answer the question about Covid-19 and the kind of the cleanliness that the bikes go through, but in terms of the first sort of parking question, I can let Jennifer answer that, certainly- and in regard you know.
Four that the city DOH, you know like the Department of Health, tries to share right.
And I, believe the mayor's office and the police department in general are working to find out the way to stop how to bring the firework to the city of New. It's not only happening in CB12.
Eight seven two, three six zero and the fire department said that every time you hear fire works being exploited to call, then I believe this number has been shared with board members and board.
Department, and I, encourage you to continue calling 718, 722, 3600 and report any firework complaint that you may have also call 3- As, you know, this Monday yesterday, the city reopened the or gave permission you know to go to phase two and get permission to the restaurant, to use the sidewalk and the parking lane to operate to serve food outdoors many restaurants.
You know the details of how the boss way going to be implemented at 101St Street, the Department of parks and recreation, informed at the district service cabinet meeting that four swimming pools will be open in Manhattan during the summer, but not high, bridge swimming pool, because this site is being used as a coffee, 19 testing center, the Asia raid, the Department of Human Administration, informed that they are replacing all the air conditioners over five years to the people that are in the program receiving air conditioner by age or eight.
Let everybody know that the office, the Community Board 12, has a facebook.
You know, send your request and you can see all the information we're planning to reboot this facebook page during the summer time and be able to post all the information important information from Community Board 12.
I think it's extremely important ebenezer when you have information like that to share with businesses that you actually communicate with folks who chair these committees, you know so that we could try to potentially send an email out or add it to the agenda and as far as the bus lane goes Where, like a community conversation about it, And, that's the fight because, as we know.
We were discussing cb12s facebook and youtube channels, and it was pointed out that when you send out the emails, those links are available at the bottom of the email and we discussed sending you know all the board members or the republican general, an email just reminding them that if they scroll down to the bottom of the email they can access and subscribe to community boards.
Like I said before, we're going to be working to revamp and make sure everybody knows about our Youtube Channel and Facebook account as well.
I am forwarding to both you and ebenezer a report that our transportation policy- analyst Paul wrote right after that last minute, DOT, meeting summarizing it and providing the relevant links so that you can share it with the entire board.
My first started your community Board meeting, and I really appreciate that you guys hosting me today, I'm, bringing up a situation that going on in our neighborhood.
I was walking to go to work around seven something in the morning and the homeless, people even using the drugs on the street, you know, and even getting high.
Seiu 32Bj represents approximately one in every 100 adults in New, York City, including more than 2,800, who live or work here in Community board, 12.
And for the last year and a half we've supported chipotle workers here in New, York City struggling to better their working conditions.
I appreciate that so I'll just continue in the first week of March workers at five New York City restaurants, Went on strike after chipotle managers, pressured workers to work sick with coronavirus symptoms, despite the mounting crisis of the pandemic, and studies that have come out since then show that there were likely already thousands of Coronavirus cases in New York City.
They have not been following a lot of the requirements and just implementing basic things like sneeze guards to protect workers, and they also have like a lot of other outstanding issues related to fair work, week, laws as well, and basically you know that you know She's lives in her neighborhood She needs to protect herself and her family and her community as well.
I have extra time, since she was doing translation in spanish, because if I had a double time, or at least like an additional minute or something like that, I, do not know if that's in the rules, but given the fact that we're not providing translation as a community board.
So I'm not sure why all of those folks did not raise their hands to speak during the public session, but I felt that for our board members, who may not be monitoring the chat, it's important for them to have the benefit of knowing that these are some of the questions and concerns that the public is raising.
So, all the questions that I know is on everybody's mind: How is this going to work Are more relevant in Manhattan than anywhere else.
The issue that Liz ritter just brought up and that I hear about every single community board is this tension between the need for the restaurants and the question of what they could or could not do, etc.
The answer is absolutely yes, but what the city is thinking of doing and thinking of is the word that I was told, is a mediation process for restaurants that are having challenges and where there are complaints and supposedly to use oath or a private organization called Jams, which I probably should know, but do not And, apparently they're willing to do the mediation for free, so community boards need to be absolutely front and center, as community Board three said tonight.
I know that housing is utmost of importance to Community, Board, 12 and all of us without getting into the wonderful work that's going on in Albany and the City Council, and the fact that there's a new housing connect, Portal.
You know, the mayor, cut the pickup in the budget, but we are pushing at least have one organics drop off per community board, because if we lose that momentum again, it goes right to the landfill.
This was a resolution that was brought forward by Tanya, and the committee made some modifications and we felt that it was prudent being that, as things are beginning to as businesses is starting to reopen to be able to start advocating for equitable processes in which we could but support our local businesses, whether it be via lenders or etc, but just make making sure that we're able to provide equitable access to communities of color within New, York City, specifically district 12.
You do yes, steve in the fifth, whereas I would like to suggest that instead of saying inadequate, that you should say inappropriate and and that you should indicate due to soil, contamination, Slope, park, alienation and accessibility issues and then end the, whereas clause at that point, because I do not believe that the money had was ever transferred to d.o.e. And I do not have that screen open, but that sounds perfectly reasonable.
Think I would like to commend liz, because if folks did not participate in that meeting, you would see what being somebody who brought everybody together and developed a constructive way of being able to take negative situations and not let community members go against each other, but identify issues and figure out how to commonly attack.
I left with the understanding that as a community, we must advocate for more garbage bins within our parks, but also being able to figure out how to have the community members also engage with anybody who they feel is doing something that is out of out of that would impact the area, but also letting folks know that this neighborhood, carrying effect of being able to call the police and falsely accuse people was, is not going to be tolerated.
She is currently actually looking to go back and work with some of the members of the Lgbt task force so to try and make sure that it is, you know, even more further inclusive of other language that we would like to have included in the future.
The committee was really just looking forward to try and pass a resolution once we've gotten, you know a bit more feedback from the Lgbt task force.
So We, of course, want you to please review and let us know what you think of this individual resolution.
I. Think a lot of people have realized that it is, quite frankly, not going to present many of the resolutions that we would like to see, and I.
It is essentially referring to a language that was previously voted on and supports, making sure that we are allocating money in the city's budget so as to ensure that we're providing any refugees that are potentially moved to New York City.
You know so as to get essentially aid in the event that happens, we saw that in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria that had left a number of recently resettled refugees and immigrants seeking opportunities that were not necessarily being made available, and so this is just continuing that kind of work that we've already presented prior to everyone, and we just want to make sure that everyone is aware that this is now going to be essentially passed for this board.
, just whatever you're saying just add it as a, whereas to the resolution, okay, all right and being that it's okay I think it sounds as if we're going to have to just make a vote, because it's an amendment.
The resolution The only thing point I want to make is this: New verbiage has to be done tonight because we actually have to vote on the actual words tonight.
The Community board passed a resolution asking the Department of City planning to in fact, rezone, most or all c8.
The board of standards and appeals will not issue a special permit until you know both DEP and Dht provide their sign offs at the June committee.
You know project further and voted to support the special permit, and you know noting a number of things that you know the school already exists in the community.
We asked in supporting it that the applicants you know continue to coordinate with the committees of the community Board as the project moves forward as it as activities at the site begin in terms of construction, then, as they get ready to occupy it, and we also ask that they coordinate with you know: local, nearby community- based organizations, of which there are a couple that are literally next door as well as small businesses and the you know the Washington Heights bid as they you know, as they are moving to 181St Street.
You know expectations, but I do think it was important to just move forward with the resolution because it was discussed in committee and our committee voted, so I do not want to make a decision to not write it after we had already voted on it at our community level, right.
Thank you for all the work you've been doing and and for doing two resolutions, and probably fifty I know, there's a lot of public safety issues.
That's going on in the community, including the you know, the fireworks and other issues, each day, everything's, changing you!
We 're, saying simply that you know there are a lot of other issues also happening in our community.
We would like the staff to be more specific when we send out the public notice, but you know we can work with them.
We have resolutions for March that were passed by committee, but not by the General Board meeting.
So, on your first question, number, six And you're, referring to for June right, No March, the six.
What was that agenda item number six for the March 11th meeting the resolution.
I do not know if I'll have time to vote on these resolutions, questions.
Okay, so you're going to be voting on lettered resolutions, So for June, there's licensing, one two, three, five, six and eight numbers four and seven were withdrawn, and then for March.
The meantime, people can look at an email from paula on June 17th at 2:16, P.M, June 17th at 2:16 P.M, just this morning at 11:06 for the March items that was just separately right today at 1106 from Chanel Barbara, this morning's email, where it says, there's an image with the agenda and the second page of the second image under the June includes numbers, one through eleven, okay, the.
I'm still talking a lot about food access for seniors and there seems to be quite a number of sources, but there are still issues, especially with people that are getting food delivered to them by the city.
For, March, I'm, going to ask you to say you know yes to all or yes to all, except whatever, on which I vote no or abstain or whatever.
So you are voting no on June six and eight, No on March, 9:10, 11,14 and yes to the rest.
So abstaining all March, except yes, on 17, okay, on June, I vote no.
Yes, you're number, eight for June and abstaining to the rest of those you're, abstaining to letter d and voting.
I am voting no for number, eight June and yes to the rest.
I will yes to all except number eight for June with a thank you to public safety for F, looks like public safety is getting all the love here.
Since I work for the city parks, department, abstaining on F and abstaining on six and voting no on eight switch, six June 6 or March 6 June, okay, voting no on eight and yes to everything, including all of the March resolutions.
The very the very resolution I try to vote for a thousand times on I'm going to have to now change it so that I am not voting due to conflict.
What Community Board for John may you know working on the transmission making all this possible And I wish you everyone to have a healthy and wonderful summer.
If folks would like me to share that, I can do so as I always do with ebenezer, and I also wanted to say that we had a tenants rights forum or a few of them in which people got to ask questions to a legal aid attorney.
The same thing is happening, so I just want to flag that so that we can open up a conversation, not now, but during a during the next committee meeting for either parks or public safety, because I do think that something needs to be addressed in that regard.
