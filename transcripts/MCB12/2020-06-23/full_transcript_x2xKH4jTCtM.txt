Not okay, we're live! Oh you look good lis! Thank you, gabby. I appreciate that maria best wishes. This is one of my. This is one of my. Let me see as experience. You know, because I've been I've been through this scene for 30. What is it? 1983 was my first campaign. You were a baby at that time, but anyway, this is interesting because, as you know, I remember that campaign well, but that is you know a lot of still. You learn a lot, especially from people who you're supposed to know. So it's okay, it's okay! Well, you know whatever happens, god is good. I am very grateful to being on this community, which all you know that I adore and I will always defend it and, let's go you know: let's go on tomorrow be another day and the other day and the other day, and I hope everybody is healthy, rich and good. Looking, yes, silvia cruz, I would that would be nice. That's such a great sister! She just gave me lemonade nice. I'm gonna be hitting the ice water hard. Oh so refreshing all right, who's running this meeting. Do we have quorum? Looks it oh see, are you on? Are you here? Can you take attendance? Yes, gracias. I don't have again we're going back to. I don't have the attendance sheet because it wasn't sent to me, but what can it be sent to you now? One would hope right. So where is our illustrious chair and our vice chairs? I don't know ellie's on it, looks like I'm not seeing them on the second page well, he's showing. I see his name and he's muted yeah. Well, at least he exists. This is good. They see that I saw someone on the line. Excellent. Ah I see lesser okay, eliasr are you here at least may I just interred for a second. I just noticed that the border president is having some type of land use. Committee. New members is that okay is that going on? Why do you know it's not just members, it's open to the public, and I pointed out that it's overlapping with our general meeting and asked whether they could offer it again and I was told that they are going to offer it again. They will also be currently listening to youtube Manhattan training series, so it is always going to conflict with somebody's meeting somewhere right, [Applause] yeah. I know, but I think this is the second time in particular that the land use one conflict. Now we're ready to go general meeting, you never go live smart, you don't need it. Well, that's never true! I have a question well with that said, though, I know that there's a second part to it for more for a more advanced course. I signed up for that one, how much more advanced is it and do you really do you think that participating in the first one lays a necessary foundation to participate in the second one? No, because I could probably email to you the presentations that will be used. Okay for the advanced one and yes, are we ready to go? There is a lot of information from the first one, that's covered again, so it gives you perfect background. Okay, thank you. I'll, speak more about this later. If you want it, can you email me the attendance sheet? Please I don't have that list. Gonna may send it to you, I'm gonna. Look for that, but I don't have it right now right. So, let's get started so we have 43 panelists out of which some are can't hear you asr come on. You got to boost your input. Can you hear me better okay? So I was just saying that we have on my list on my panelist list. We have about 40 panelists out of which I'm assuming that there are public members, some dlt presenters and some some other people that I can recognize because I just see a bunch of numbers, so I'm gonna call the meeting to order is seven actually no 6 39 welcome each and every one of you guys for making making the time and making the effort to be here tonight or this evening, beautiful weather out it's been kind of hot. So that makes this effort especially appreciative for you guys to be here so we're gonna start by adopting jones agenda. Can I get some eyes? We need emotion. First, there you go. Can you hear me now? Yes, I move to adopt curtis all right. Can we get a motion curtis? That would be a second maria already moved great, so june's agenda motion adopted moving along to the adopting of the may 20 minutes. Can we get a motion so moved? I know not. We don't have many minutes. We have the April minutes, so we're going to have to approve those first right. So I make a motion that we approve the April minutes. Who was that idea? Okay, all right and I'll have the June the may minutes next month, next meeting any nays, any abstentions. No all in favor on the chairs report. There's many things to do, but I'm gonna now take this opportunity to do something to what I think is priority, which is a presentation spare headed and quarterbacked by our chair of dnt david avian on a department of transportation, citibank, presentation on how they're moving forward with their their future and appliances. They have for uptown Manhattan in the installation of city bikes, making them available for underserved communities and so forth. So I don't know each one of you guys names. So if you guys kind of mute yourself and start the presentation for the next 10 minutes, we'll appreciate it. Thank you absolutely thank you chair good evening. Everyone and hello, I'm jennifer santenez, I'm the Manhattan deputy borough, commissioner, at the new york city department of transportation, and I wanted to thank community board 12 for hosting us tonight. We had presented to the cb12 traffic and transportation committee earlier this month and we're happy to return tonight to be here to present the plans to the full board and share some time with you this evening. I also want to extend to thank you to all of our elected officials and your dedicated staff, who are joining us on tonight's call. It's always nice to see a lot of familiar faces and attendee participant names on our virtual meetings. So tonight I'm joined by my colleagues from the Manhattan office, lyle, blackwood and jackie lazaro, as well as my colleagues from the bike share team, mobile kessler and jesse cabrera jesse is the bike share. Outreach coordinator and he'll be walking us through some slides tonight to provide more details on our plans to expand access to bike share across washington heights and inwood over the course of the next year. So at this time, I'll just go ahead and turn it over to jesse. Thank you. Thank you, jennifer and thank you all of Manhattan community board 12 for having me today. So if I can just start, I need screen sharing capabilities and jesse, while we're figuring that out, if you would be so kind as to make the powerpoint presentation available to the office or to me so that I can crib notes from that sure. So one thing it is available online at our website, but I I'll make sure to send it after this presentation. Thank you right, and that has been those links have been sent to the board, but also DOT t or I don't know. If this is best by ebenezer and team. You can put the links in the in the q a also maybe for people to pick up thanks, and one thing to note is the one that we're sharing today is an abbreviated sort of version, so the one that we'll share in the q a will have much more details in it. Perfect all right ebenezer are you gonna, be able to set jessie up to share this video we're working on that we're working on? Okay, thank you. It looks like I can start sharing. I think you can. I think you can thanks ebenezer all right great. Can everyone see the presentation? Yes great? So once again, thank you very much. Like I said, I'm gonna go through an abbreviated presentation hitting some hitting some important facts about the expansion of city bike up into washington heights and inwood. So just generally, what is city bike city bike is new york, city's bike share system and it's a private public partnership. The public aspect comes from us D.O.T and what we're responsible for is planning and outreach and lyft who owns city bike, they're responsible for the day-to-day operations and the maintenance of the equipment. One thing to note is that no city funds are used to operate citibike that comes from the users who pay to use this system and any sponsorships that lyft has and what we're in the midst of is the phase three expansion. So if you see on this map that light blue area is the sort of first phase of citibike, which was in 2013 after that, a couple of years later into that royal blue area, we expanded into the upper west side of the east side into Queens for the first time and deeper into Brooklyn, and what we're in the middle of now is our phase three expansion that all that dark blue area that you see on the map, and that includes going into Brooklyn for the going to the Bronx for the first time, completing Manhattan and going deeper into neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens such as corona elmer's in Queens and sunset park in Brooklyn. This will happen over the next five years, up until 2024 and all in all. After all, after all, is said and done, there will be about 40 000 bikes, distributed across the entire service system. So the installation timeline that we have planned for community board 12 specifically, is broken it up into two parts. This summer we expect to install city bike stations in the southern half of the board, so from 155th street right up until 184th street. That would accomplish about 30 stations and later we're going to come back and finish off the rest of the community board only up to 220th street. If you can see this map the reason why we we're doing this is we want to create this sort of contiguous equal service area across Manhattan and and the Bronx. So we created a draft plan for station locations within Manhattan community board 12 and the two main sort of considerations are our own planning and technical, siding guidelines and community outreach, and, as jennifer mentioned, we presented this plan to the traffic and transportation committee on June 1st, so public outreach there's a couple of sort of facets of it. So the one of the one of the ways we collected outreach was through a public workshop held in January, and this public workshop gave people a short presentation of what citibike is and we presented a map. As you see on this, this top image here presented a map asking people hey. Where do you? Where here would you? Where would you like to see city bike stations or where wouldn't you like to see city bike stations and people place stickers on the map and that's how we collected feedback there? In addition, you can see at this at the inlet library we went to, we went out to do pop-up community outreach and what that entails is we went to different libraries and rec centers and we set up and asked people hey. You know the same thing like we did in the workshop. Just smaller and abbreviated and people were able to choose. Yes, I would like to see city-based stations. There are no, and at the same time, we had a online feedback portal map open for about a month and a half actually is closer to two months and people were again able to drop in pins and say yes, you know, I want to see a city bike station here or no, and in addition to that, we have stakeholder meetings with places such as the new york port author, the new york, new jersey, port authority, different parks, NYCHA facilities to make sure that their input is taken into account as well, and this is the more planning side of what we're looking for when we, when we put stations down. So one thing that we're looking for is a high density of stations so that you're never more than a three to five minute, walk from any point within the station. We want it to be a reliable transportation system, so we don't want you. If there's like an empty station, we don't want you to have to walk 15-20 minutes until you find another station. We generally like to add larger stations adjacent to large destination, a very popular destination such as transit hubs or supermarkets, or things like that, where there's going to be a lot more foot, traffic and generally smaller ones in residential areas and the actual sighting of the station there's other things we have to consider, such as utilities, manholes street furniture, trees, sidewalk width, to make sure that nothing really gets impeded when we place a station down so like I said, we combined all that outreach and our citing guidelines and made this draft plan, of which we presented to community board 12 the transportation committee. It's available right now on our website, nyc.gov spikeshare the maps and plans tab, and you can just scroll down until you see Manhattan community board 12 and we're still accepting feedback on these stations. If there's, you know something that we didn't think about, and you think a station should be moved for whatever reason you can send your feedback via two different options. One is contacting jennifer and her folks at the Manhattan borough commissioner's office numbers right there or you can email us directly us being the bike share unit at this email address, we're going to be accepting feedback for another week up until June 30th. So we can. We can synthesize everything and make sure that we have a plan that best works for the community with installationing happening later this summer and, like I said that was a quick abbreviated version, we can provide a longer presentation that has stuff such as ridership stats and pricing and some more detailed information about our planning process, so yeah. Thank you very much and we'll field any questions, and if I may eli, if you wouldn't mind, as I'm sure people have questions or they want to make observations, I just want people to understand what the process is from here. So I will be consolidating back from cb12 board members combining that, with our minutes from our meeting on June first, which had again board member cut feedback, as well as some public feedback and I'll be sending that out before the deadline of June of June 30.. This is not a resolution item, so our opportunity will be in that manner. Anybody from the public obviously can go direct to D.O.T. I understand you know: eli really wants to move the agenda and I think- and I'm supportive of that. I just want to capture that when you do have a chance to look at the map- and I hope people already did- that the hottest station and the only one that there were two that had issues in particular and number one on that list was a station that you'll see on the map at west 157th, there's a variety of reasons: why a number of board members, and thanks to maria luna, curtis wayne, etc, who were able to provide pictures and very specific feedback that will be sort of one area. So I understand people are going to want to talk tonight but know that I have captured if you have provided that information. I certainly do have that second station at 181st in cabrini we've had a number of people comment on that station and our first vice chair actually did a whole write up for me. That included two other stations to comment on as well, so with that, I certainly open it to questions, but people should rest assured that if you've already provided impact information that I have, that and and I'll have omar back me up on sort of reviewing everything to make sure that we haven't missed anything etc. Thank you. We have five. I wanna just raise six now, so I'm gonna just quickly demonstrate again for folks who don't know how to raise their hand at the bottom of the screen. You will see the participants, tab and there's 89 of you, so the but or us so. The best way is to fit is to raise your hand via the raised hand function. So once you click at the participants, you're going to see all of our names- and there is on the bottom right, it's going to say more with a little arrow and that's where you click and you hit or sorry excuse me at the end: yeah, that's where you click and you hit raise, I'm now a co-host. So it's a little different, but that's where you go to raise hand. If you have trouble, you can text me so we're gonna start stacks. There's procedural, quick, procedural thing yeah. So we have a bunch of questions in the chat that relate to noise and traffic and stuff. I just want to let people know that there that those issues will be addressed later in the agenda and the district managers report in the different committee reports. Don't think that we're ignoring you, even though we're not answering those questions right now, we're just focused on this item, but we will get to those things, one other procedural question: how do people sign up for the public session because I or whoever's the host? I need you to mute everyone across the board because there's someone who has their open microphone, I'm hearing something that is really kind of like bothering each and every one of us so catherine, you know the sadly poster questions. She should really raise her hand so that we can get it in some sort of water who had their hands raised prior to sally's. Oh, she was she. The first sister is the first one yeah, so I'm gonna go in order. So first is the sea little followed by danielle. Okay, thank you, one. Second, one minute questions and two million rebuttals, so we can speed up the process of it. Thank you, hi jesse, a great work on the presentation and even better job in minimizing the impact on the local parking spots. I know that it's difficult, but I'm glad that you know you do your best. So when we met other committee, I emphasize the fact that you know this has to be accessible and to the points that I raised where that accessibility, as far as like you know the common people who don't have credit cards or don't have debit cards, that you should have some type of technology, it's similar, perhaps to what the metric is all about where common people can have access to these bikes, because I think that you know everyone should have access out to the bikes, because I think it's a critical aspect of your service. Secondly, instructions also be should be displayed in spanish. It's a spanish, my speaking community. That needs to have the attention of everyone, and I'm sure that you know you will come through that because I don't think it's difficult, but the most important thing is obviously the fact that we need to have equal access and provide some type of options where clients can buy some type of cards and have access to the bikes. That's my comment. Thank you all right. Thank you. Oh I just had something quickly to say. We did know that the issue of people who are unbanked. I did note that and I've been you know. I raised the point to lift who owned city bike, that this is an important thing. As for the spanish sort of instructions, a lot of our bikes and kiosks do come in sort of by have bilingual instruct instructions on it. So rest assured that that's something that's definitely that def that definitely can do going up into cb12. Thank you just get who's the first person daniel. Can you hear me yes now we can thank you for your presentation, so I have a bunch of questions like the more one minute. I'm not sure if this was covered during the traffic and transportation committee, so I'm just gonna sort of read them off guess. The first thing I want to say is: I was on the traffic and transportation committee for almost two years, and I was unaware that this was an upcoming project in the neighborhood, and I didn't hear about any of those meetings that were opportunities to provide feedback. So that's the first thing I wanted to say I was wondering what the impact of city bike, if you've looked into this at all, what the impact has been on local businesses, specifically bike businesses, because we do have one in on dikeman. Another thing I wanted to know is: when you talk about outreach who exactly you outreached to so I would want to know demographics age. You mentioned port authority, but that's not in our district. Also, this seems like a lot of stations. So I'm wondering how this is going to impact parking, sidewalks and two other quick things, I'm wondering for people that might not have credit cards what options there are for those folks and then the last thing I'm wondering is. I actually am a bike rider recently with Covid-19 to preserve my mental health and I've nearly been hit flash killed several times. So I'm wondering what efforts or what steps they might. You might take to help with safety in the neighborhood just because it is a very busy and congested area yeah. I think before you begin. Yes again, I want I want each and every one of us to please pay extremely careful attention to the questions and the answers. We have the tendency to access some questions. Five minutes later after he's been answered, so please just bear with us sorry to catch you on no worries in terms of you know, city bike, and you know regular bike traffic there's. This sort of, I guess perception that there's a competing sort of use between city bike and personal bikes, and that's not necessarily always the case. You know people who don't have a bike may have a variety of reasons. Some of it could be like they just don't have space in their tiny new york city apartment or they don't want to deal with maintenance or they don't have you know they don't know how to you know they don't know how to navigate. You know, bike shops and all this so this sort of eliminates that sort of barrier for entry, so we don't really see them as competing sort of uses and I'll answer. The other thing about safety in in washington heights and one thing that we did mention during the community meeting is we have this mayor de Blasio announced in 2019 this green wave initiative and that is to increase bicycle infrastructure, not only in you know not only in bike share expansion areas, but throughout the five boroughs- and that includes you- know, physical infrastructure and education of the best rule the rules in the road, the rules of the road. So that's something that has already been in motion and whenever there is any sort of safety projects, it would come through the community board before anyone else and quickly. Last thing, so I don't go over my time. The the meeting that we had was in coordination with cb12 the outreach meeting, and on top of that, the pop-up meetings were in the libraries in community board 12 as well, so they would just pop up and we just showed up and whoever was inside at the time we were able to speak to thanks. Yes, next up is francisco lopez. Hello guys. Can you guys hear me? Yes, jesse. Thank you for joining us. I really appreciate you and taking the time to speak with us couple questions how much parking is being sacrificed for these city bikes, one two when you guys get together and discuss the communities that you guys are trying to be active in how much conversation is surrounded around need. So I'll answer that second question first, so this was this expansion was announced back in July 2019 and if I can reshare it quickly, so this expansion happened in 2019 and let me go back here, so the suspension was announced in 2019 and in that expansion in the in that announcement. One thing that we want to make sure is that wherever we expand to there's sort of a contiguous and continuous boundaries, so let's say, for instance, if we wanted to expand to you know this northern tip of the western Bronx- it wouldn't have made sense to you know. First, have you know, have all of this in Manhattan 12 and then leave all this empty and have you know the little tippy top filled in? So we want to make sure it's wherever we want, wherever we expand to we're expanding a lot nearby. So whenever you take a bike you're, not just suddenly in an area that has no sort of that has no city bike stations because that's a transit. You know that wouldn't really fly in terms of parking. We are still sort of analyzing and making sure how much parking loss and we're trying to balance everything out. I believe the number that was sort of estimated back in the in the transportation committee was, I believe, roughly around 60, but we're still sort of trying to balance all the needs of the community. Thank you jesse. Can you just provide the split between sidewalk stations and street locations for the and how many total are in this proposal? I'm sorry! I don't have it right in front of me. I don't have it right in front of me either, but I believe it's like more or less a, I believe, there's 15, sidewalk and 13 road bed or it might be the other one yeah. Okay, all right! Sorry, we have maria luna, okay, maria! You omit yourself. Would you oh maria, can I say one quick thing until the next person, you guys figure out who's? Next, no wait! I got the next person already it's barbara, oh wait! Can maria do star six? Does that work for her? Oh there. She is no! Okay! Very briefly. The gentleman from from dlt just mentioned that this discussion started in 20 2019 in July. I do remember, we don't meet on July august until September. So the fact is that the information that got to us about the city bike came a little too late before they made some decisions or some planning I am not against bikes. I just want to make sure that the two stations that are more there that we have been discussing 157th street and 184th street. I saw you debbie that at the last meeting on June 1st that we are going to put like a group of people together that live around our area, you know near those areas to make recommendations and to see how we could really make it make plan. Not only the city but also the community parking is a you know, is a problem in our you know difficult community, and I think that we were supposed to be having a meeting something like tomorrow. The 24th about you know coming up with some recommendations, especially about 157 on 181st street. What is that? I believe that bruce de simon wayne, myself, that live within, like about like five or ten blocks from you know from this particular area and gimbaling up on the 181st, we're going to have the opportunity so do. Can we make a recommendation like as a group as opposed to individuals, so to make it more? You know yeah. This is the first I heard about any such meeting. Sorry, yes, I had an email about something that were supposed to have. You know a few days so they were. They gave us few dates to see which one would be you know better for all of us and tomorrow I think it's June 24 in the morning with something you know something like that, but I'm trying to find my emails and my answers. Who is who is they to add some information? You know, but what was the final question maria? So we can have david? We have time. Do we have time to make that recommend final recommendation and we will, if they listen to us, because I mean we are the ones that live around here in this you know the vicinity of the 157th street and you know by broadway and morgan plays and things like, so that so the question is: do is there still time to make recommendations before it's by June 30th yesterday, fantastic, thank you so much wait. I I'm not sure where the gap is here. We have we're community board and our committee received this. I don't. I don't want to see a subset of self-appointed just because you live near there. We have a process if there's a gap in the process as I've described it. Of course I want to know about that, but I have captured the points about 157th as well as the excellent and it's not just one suggestion about alternative sites for that, and so the process again is that while this isn't a resolution item, the community board comments from our community board, members will go back to DOT in a consolidated form, so I'm sort of I'm not sure what the gap is. I feel like is it that you don't believe I'm gonna pass that or like am I missing no before it becomes a discussion. I think that we all will if there's something wrong with the process. Let's talk about that process. Yes, let me let me interject on our board. Let me interject, I think that we all here been long enough to understand that the process is that suggestions and recommendations go to the committee and then it goes past the committee. I think that very clear in each and each and every one of our minds. So I think that's it next question, please yeah! So, just let folks know because I do see folklore raising their hand, we're wrapping up the points with barbara and flamingo, which was seven hands. As duffy said any comments, any extra questions can go straight to the committee because there's still time to compile all of this information so go ahead. Barbara. My question is this: recently the mta has acknowledged that people of lower income would receive special metro cards to have a reduced rate in order to ride. I want to know, since lyft is running this, if people, especially because we have many lower income, people in community board 12, if there will be based on like the metro card status or some other indicator, that they will receive a reduced rate, because I believe the standard rate for a metro for a city bike is something like 90 a month which is not cheap. So it's literally the question that isidro asked four questions ago. No, he didn't ask about a reduced rate. Excellent question. D.O.T has got a very good answer on that. Okay, he did not ask that liz. Really that's rude now. The other thing I have is this: it says in your document that the the city doesn't have any money that it has to do toward the funding of this, but in the taking up of streetscape for the some of the road space. Many some places like, for example, when I see city bike in the east village, they've taken up many places on the on the road space, which would normally be metered parking. So the city is giving up metered parking for free to city bike. I think now, which spaces are you in washington heights? I think, for example, along 181st street it is metered parking. How much are we then in essence subsidizing citibite, I'm sure w. Can you me thank you me and barbara? Please thank you. So I can answer that first question regarding regarding pricing. So for pricing, one thing to note: it's approximately 15 a month for city bike, so it comes out to be roughly a hundred and seventy dollars for the entire year for unlimited usage of city bike, so it's much less than the 90 or so that you might have thought it is. And secondly, even though it's only 15 a month, we have a further reduced rates for people that live in NYCHA or people who receive food stamps or are part of the snap program, and that rate would be five dollars a month for a total of sixty dollars a year for the entire year. You can find more information in the longer sort of presentation that we gave the transportation committee. Thank you who's. The next person, catherine, it's domingo, okay, yeah, so my concern again is around parking because it seems, like you, have different sectors of the community already being able voicing their concerns. My concern is more around. What's going to be, what's going to be done in 184th street and beyond 181st street, because I'm assuming that dlt already canvassed that area, but there's a big set like there's a lot of restaurants and and dining areas which already limit the amount of parking spaces for the community so being taking further more, I think, would be, will create a sort of catastrophic, very chaotic area. So I would like to know the breakdown of parking spaces being lost north of 181st street yeah. So right now we don't have any. We don't have any sort of plans for north of 184th street right now. The city bike stations only go up to 184th street. I said 181st 181., so I can quickly. It looks quit like doing a rough estimate. Here there seems to be two road bed stations between 181st and 184th. I don't know the exact specific how large those stations are off the top of my head, so they would in that short section. It should be anywhere between five or six five or six per station, no in total. In total. All right, but again I think- and I have to reiterate- is: was there like some sort of impact study done on the impact that it's gonna have? If we take away those parking spaces in a area, that's so frequented by customers, curtis actually wait. If we're taking another hand, it's sad! No because he was he was there yeah. So sally was there in the beginning, following the order, yeah we're following another yeah, it's 7 15., yes and others have been waiting too. All right. I have my hand up too barbara actually got my question. I just really wanted from a process standpoint to let people know how they're going to get on the public session list. We got that so we'll announce in a second. What's the next person, daryl or curtis was that I don't think no, it was actually gerard. All right I'll, be quick, I'll, be quick. This is the city bikes. It's related to two questions I had that are still unanswered in the committee question was parking. I made it very clear that this is a is an easy ask for you to prepare a little sketch. There is absolutely no reason you should be coming to us without an exact count on parking spots at a loss. It's disingenuous and you're not seriously engaging us when you can't bring them at a minimum, roughly that you just didn't bring it second question that was never answered still to tonight in the context of the tremendous sacrifice that residents and businesses have made and will continue to make, I asked about Covid-19 spreaders. These bikes are Covid-19 spreaders. You said you couldn't answer. You gave me a vague thing that it gets cleaned a little. We are being asked as residents and businesses to work at less occupancies. These businesses are still sacrificing. I think you owe the community an answer. How do you make this? Not a Covid-19, spreader and they're, going to ask a business to not do business on the street, but meanwhile, citibike is by far a huge culvert spreader. How do you keep this clean and how do you keep the public safe? That was my question. Okay, yeah. So like the what going back to what we said earlier in the committee, so they one thing to know is that, yes, they do get cleaned every so often when a maintenance person has to go fix a bike or when they're parked adjacent to hospitals such as the one on 169th street and and fort washington avenue. So the city has been working with lyft to sort of proactively, monitor and try to combat the spread of Covid-19, and let me see the first, so I'm not gonna. Do I'm not gonna do back and forth, but businesses have to have to register when they're cleaning their spots, these restaurants and everything else. They have to have a clear definition, and you do I'll stop now, but why don't you have to do the same thing? Businesses are being asked to do? Can you can you clarify it? I think I think he's saying that the requirements for businesses to cling to the process of kobe are not the same as the one that you've been explaining, since you were at the committee level, so he liked to have a clear and transparent answer. As to the two, the same question that has been asked twice and nothing is being specifically answered. Well, I think I believe that I did answer the question about Covid-19 and the kind of the cleanliness that the bikes go through, but in terms of the first sort of parking question, I can let jennifer answer that, certainly, and in regard you know, we can try to get additional clarification as to what additional measures lyft is taking for cleaning. We can certainly send you the link to their website. That kind of outlines their practices to stop the spread, but just in general, you know we're it's up to us. It's up to new yorkers to practice the core. Four that the city doh, you know like the department of health, tries to share right. Just like good hygiene, maintain six feet of distance, wear a face covering and there's another one, and it's and it's escaping my mind. But you know we do try to stress that all bike share users practice. You know good hygiene and we do see that a lot of customers are following those practices. So going to the first question about parking, we did speak about this at the committee level and our process is this: you know we don't come to the board with a final set plan, formal surveys that are completed. You know we come to the board and we share our draft plan. So these are locations that haven't yet been formally cited. We're looking to get your feedback on all of these sites. We did bring an average station size right, so I think it was 25 DOT count to the committee level as well. To kind of give you a general idea of how many spaces would be taken up in the parking lane, as well as how much heat would be taken up on the sidewalk. So if there's any particular location that you're kind of you know, you want more information on. Please share that with debbie reach out to us, like you know, we're trying to provide as much information as we can that we have available at the moment. Thank you before I wrap it up and move on to the next report. Darryl, do you still have your hands up? I do yeah just real quick, because I know this was an issue with at least one of the sites. Some of the areas are under construction. Do you know how much that's going to impede putting these sites up, and can you explain how that's going to work and how you're coordinating with other agencies sure yeah whenever there's construction, what we try to do is find a suitable area. That's nearby that sort of satisfies that three to five minute sort of station density that we want. So, let's say, for instance, this will be something. That's you know that will wrap up, maybe in a month or two. What will probably happen is we'd hold off on that particular station and then once the construction clears up then we would add. Then we would install the station but let's say, for instance, it's a much longer term construction. Then we would do what I just said. Is we try we'll try to find somewhere else nearby place it temporarily there and then once that construction wraps up place it back into the original location? Okay, thank you. Thank you. I have a concern. I'm not it's mary! I'm not able to do the hand raise thing, but I do have some comments. Yeah go ahead. Mary. Can I go ahead. My concern is about the sidewalk stations and the difficulty the narrow, with the narrowing path to get by with wheelchairs and walkers or people who need you know, physical assistance, where two people have to walk together because one is holding the other or you know if they're blind that sort of thing. So I have a big concern about that, because we have enough issues with the you know: sidewalk cafes and all that sort of thing impeding- and you know disabling the disabled to really be able to get by on those sidewalks. So I just want to put that out there. Okay, thanks mary! Thank you. Thank you. A great concern. You do. You have we'd like to make a comment before we, oh yeah. I wasn't sure if it was a question. One thing to know mary is that one of the sort of considerations is sort of ada accessibility. So if we were to put a station in and it would just make the sidewalk too narrow, for you know, people to come comfortably walk acro walk through. We wouldn't put a station on that sidewalk, but thank you very much for raising that concern. Thank you, jesse. Thank you, jennifer debbie, thank you for bringing this touchy and important subject to a general meeting is usually not the norm, but I felt that it was. We needed everyone's input and it's usually done better at a general meeting rather than our committee meeting, because we all so occupied and doing so many other things. So I felt that it was a need to do this, so I like to get your apologies first for myself for bringing it to this level. So thank you jennifer again, thank you. Jesse. It's been great and debbie, so thank you so much ebenezer your report. Thank you, mr chairman. Always it's a pleasure being here as your district manager and give you my report. First fireworks and noise in the district. This is not a cb12 Manhattan issue. This is an issue happening citywide all over the city. We have the problem with the firework. I have been receiving a lot of complaints regarding fireworks and noise in the district for the last three weeks. Last week at the district service cabinet meeting, I had a very thorough discussion with the 33rd prison and 34 prison. They informed me that they are aware of what's happening and they would like to find a way how to attack this one so to the residents that have been calling me emailing me. The police is aware the fire department is aware- and this is a problem that is not only on community board. 12 is citywide problem and I believe the mayor's office and the police department in general are working to find out the way to stop how to bring the firework to the city of new york. It happened in citywide, it's not only happening in cb12. It's happening where I live as well and belief is not comfortable. You get scared. What, because, suddenly you know you kind of have a big explosion, and you don't know what it is. So the police department is working with that. The fire department shared a telephone number last week is the seven one. Eight seven two, three six zero and the fire department said that every time you hear fire works being exploited to call, then I believe this number has been shared with board members and board members have been using it and the person at the fire department, sales and I, and only one person- are just recording it. Nevertheless, this is the instruction that we received from the fire department, and I encourage you to continue calling 718-722-3600 and report any firework complaint that you may have also call 3-1-1. As you know, this monday yesterday, the city reopened the or gave permission you know to go to phase two and get permission to the restaurant, to use the sidewalk and the parking lane to operate to serve food outdoors many restaurants. I observed yesterday in the district that they took this very livery and they are placing a lot of chairs a long day in front of the establishment, also about the curbside they put in tents, etc. We have several discussion as a district manager city. Why try to flesh out and get the all the guidelines for the department of transportation, which is the agency regulating this activity on the street? The department of transportation have more questions than answers at this time from the district manager and these go guidelines and we'll continue having some meetings. Nevertheless, I would like to encourage any every restaurant owner to go to nycdot new york city D.O.T and find out the guidelines. There is NYC open restaurant seating criteria, people the restaurant owner can use the sidewalk adjacent to the restaurant and also the parking lanes in front of the restaurant can be used, and that is a criteria. How many feet 80 feet need to be left open for the pedestrian to work and the restaurant owners. They should provide the barricades to protect the seating area, et cetera, et cetera people are doing it. I observe the people that are following the guidelines from department of transportation. The enforcement know nobody wants to enforce the restaurant owners and make it pay big fines or the other one. You know the. On the contrary, the city would want that every restaurant be able to operate and also to be successful after everything that happened with the coffee 19 pandemic. So please, restaurant owners go to new york city D.O.T and see the seating criteria for the restaurants operation. During this situation, new york city D.O.T make an announcement. The majors often make an announcement that 100 first read will be converted in a boss way immediately. We call the eot to find out what it is, and I have a discussion at the dc service cabinet meeting. Dot is not sure, really what's going to happen at 101st street, I was told the by DOT representative that the what they mean by boss way is a variation of what have been done on 14th street. They don't have the details D.O.T, you know one also to create a community advisory board to go out over the. You know the details of how the boss way going to be implemented at 101st street, the department of parks and recreation informed at the district service cabinet meeting that four swimming pools will be open in Manhattan during the summer, but not high bridge swimming pool, because this site is being used as a coffee, 19 testing center, the asia raid, the department of human administration, informed that they are replacing all the air conditioners over five years to the people that are in the program receiving air conditioner by age or eight. So if you have an air conditioner given to you by a hra and is five years old, they will be replacing and also you can apply for new air conditioners as well. I want to let everybody know that the office, the community board 12, has a facebook page. This meeting is being broadcasted right now live in facebook and also in youtube, and we encourage everyone to visit and become a friend of our facebook page at the name of the page is office, facebook page and for cb12 and be as a member, you know, login, you know, send your request and you can see all the information we're planning to reboot this facebook page during the summer time and be able to post all the information. Important information from community board 12.. Also, our youtube channel office, NYC cb12m is available to everyone, and you can also see all the meetings that had happened since April. Until now, in our of youtube channel that is available to everyone during the summer time the office is going to be, you know, revamping the website and also the facebook and the youtube channel, and we are you know we are preparing to integrate the office with the new challenge and the new changes are going to happen when we come back in September. Thank you very much. This is the end of my report. Is there any question yeah? First, we have domingo, followed by wayne yeah. I think it's extremely important ebenezer when you have information like that to share with businesses that you actually communicate with folks who chair these committees, you know so that we could try to potentially send an email out or add it to the agenda and as far as the bus lane goes, is there anything happening where, like a community conversation about it or it's just they're, doing it and that's the fight because, as we know, we have representatives here from D.O.T, but there seems to be a certain level of cohesion when we work with them and the mess that they leave is for us to deal with while they move on to another messy project, yes domingo. I agree 100 with you the information that I gathered for these dining out. It was in a special meeting that was called at the last meeting last friday. Really I don't have anything to share, but this information as soon as I have something more concrete. The only thing that I have is a link to a website that I give here. Anyone can get that one. Once I have more concrete information, I will send it out. I send information out that I get. I send it to the to our chairperson and I send it to a few business owners. But, yes, I will be sending it to you as well, but it's not much information there to give out yet, but this, the Manhattan district managers, we are working very diligent to find the details and we're going to be sharing with you as soon as possible and regarding west 101st street. Also we had a conversation with department of transportation at the district service cabinet meeting. I asked and tried to flesh out this and got as much information that I can and I share with you. D.O.T is willing to have a community group to work and find the details on this one, the details, what going to happen exactly at 100? First street- we don't know yet- and everybody has the concerns. You know what hunter refers to is not an easy cookie to put there, because it's the entrance and the exit to the from the borough coin to the Bronx and diverting the traffic around is a big mess and we are concerned soon that the very first moment we have the news. So I'm going to get back to you and I'm going to let anyone hang in there as soon as I get information, I'm going to share with everybody yeah, please any questions. Please it's wayne and to close this section is steve, simon, okay, good, so ebenezer, quick question. I think it was either at the most recent executive committee meeting or it might have been last month's board meeting. We were discussing cb12s facebook and youtube channels, and it was pointed out that when you send out the emails, those links are available at the bottom of the email and we discussed sending you know all the board members or the republican general, an email just reminding them that if they scroll down to the bottom of the email they can access and subscribe to community boards. You know facebook and you youtube from there, and my question is: was that done and if it wasn't done, would it make sense to add you know sort of a footer to all outgoing emails? Advising that you know you can you know access and subscribe to our? You know facebook and youtube channels by clicking below? Yes, we do have those footage in the staff emails and we send it out. There's nothing saying that you know you know what we discussed. Last time we discussed sending around an email tell us there were a lot of folks asking. How can they subscribe? How can they? How can they and it was sent out? It was sent out wayne at the beginning, we're going to send out again and we're going to, like I said before, we're going to be working to revamp and make sure everybody knows about our youtube channel and facebook account as well. Next question wait. I think that what the borough president does is in her daily emails, there's a live link at the top of it. That says something like did someone forward this to you? Did you not get it yourself if not subscribe? Here, I don't mean to put words into wayne's mouth, but I think what he's saying is that in all of the office's outgoing email, there should be a subscribe link in the email. Yes, this is very good suggestion. This is very good suggestion and we're gonna. Take it in mind when we're gonna. Do this revamp during the summertime next question, steve simon, steve, good, to see you good to hear from you steve. Can you hear me now? I can hear you? Yes all right! This may be a question for jonathan. Do we have to tell all the people who subscribed to our previous facebook page that they now have to subscribe to the new one yeah we had this discussion before. I don't know if jonathan is able to count that it doesn't work like that, we had a discussion before steve in the last executive committee meeting and the last meeting we're working on that to try to do the best. Okay, I think, is no more question there. Thank you very much have an excellent summer. I will see you in September. God bless you all. Thank you, ebenezer for your presentation and information. Can I ask a question about the district manager report managers report you may so just really quickly. I am forwarding to both you and ebenezer a report that our transportation policy- analyst paul, wrote right after that last minute, DOT meeting summarizing it and providing the relevant links so that you can share it with the entire board. I had only shared it with the transportation chair because it was a DOT meeting and I you know figured you know. Ebenezer was at the meeting, so I didn't, you know, need to do anything, but if that's helpful at all to as a summary, please use that. Okay, thank you. We're going to move on to the public session. Catherine, can you I think besides maddie martikal, mr collins you're the first one and then you just send me the rest of the people so for folks who are on and we apologize that this information did not go out previously. So if you are attending this meeting- and you wanna speak in during the public session for two minutes, please use the raised hand function. If you can't figure that out or having trouble, feel free to put your name in the q a and when it's your turn, we will select and unmute you so we're going to start first with martin collins and we do have caps and against two minute presentation first good evening, I'll just take a minute of your time. Thank you very much. I'm martin cohen's, the uptown arts troll coordinator from the northern Manhattan arts alliance and, as you know, the art stroll has gone virtual this year through July 30th every thursday evening at 7 30.

So please join us. You can go to artstroll.com and I'll post the details in the chat box in a moment for everybody and it'll be on zoom and facebook live this thursday evening at 7. 00., please hi! So thank you, mr collins. Sorry to catch you on! Thank you. Sorry. I should have muted myself the next person before we get one of the most important public members we have on our meeting today, who's the next person kathy. It's william beltran, okay, mr beltran, you can go ahead and unmute yourself, william, okay, so I guess we're going to go on to the next person, which is joanie rojas. I'm sorry. What was the name of the next speaker? Thank you, hello. Everyone can everybody hear me yes, hi good evening to everyone. Welcome johnny yeah that my first started your community board meeting, and I really appreciate that you guys hosting me today, I'm bringing up a situation that going on in our neighborhood, I live by 107th street between broadway and for washington, and the only situation around our neighborhood is out of control. Okay, it's at the time that sometimes early in the morning, we even had to walk through the street, because you cannot even walk in the sidewalk and, like this morning is basically, I was walking to go to work around seven something in the morning and the homeless, people even using the drugs on the street, you know and even getting high. It's like you basically need to walk in the street because you're afraid you never know what can happen to you. So I think this is something that we have to address with everyone in the community with the politicals people. I don't know how we can address the issue, so I bring it up to see how we can deal with the situation so see if things can be resolved or even get better. Okay, thank you so much joanie again and welcome to your first meeting. You can also talk about housing and human services. No, so we're gonna go on to the next person, which is sean riley. Hi. Can folks hear me? Okay, yes, great, so I'll go ahead and start hi. My name is sean riley and I'm a researcher for service employees, international union, local 32 bj, which is a union of many different service workers. Seiu 32bj represents approximately one in every 100 adults in new york city, including more than 2 800, who live or work here in community board 12. and for the last year and a half we've supported chipotle workers here in new york city, struggling to better their working conditions. I'm here tonight, because chipotle is currently seeking community approval for restaurant wine licenses at 3781, broadway and 4240. Broadway, though I see that the latter has been withdrawn for the moment, but for many reasons 32bj opposes both of these applications. The fast food industry disproportionately serves and employs underage youth. A recent study found that 14 of new york city fast food workers are teenagers. Chipotle appears to match these trends. The company targets teenagers with their marketing and was recently found to be the third favorite restaurant brand amongst teenagers, both of the proposed locations, 3781 broadway and 4240 broadway are within 2 000 feet of a total of 12 different public schools. Unlike the rest of the fast food industry, chipotle restaurants sell beer and liquor in various forms, including patron margaritas and bottles of corona, although they hold far more liquor licenses than any other fast food company in new york city over 80 in total chipotle's model can operate perfectly fine without alcohol. In new jersey, for instance, all of their stores are dry. It is illegal in new york for miners under 18 to serve or handle alcohol, but in January, based on information provided to us by chipotle employees, 32bj filed complaints with the state liquor authority, alleging that managers at four different chipotle locations in Manhattan knowingly had minors as young as 16 mixing drinks and serving beer and liquor at their restaurants. This isn't the only law workers say: chipotle has broken. Workers across the city have reported violations of new york, city's paid sick law and fair work week, law, which claim claims which the city has either settled with chipotle or still investigating. Over the last year, we've brought these concerns to Brooklyn community board 2 Queens community board, 4 and Manhattan community board 4., all of them recommended against new liquor licenses that chipotle had requested in their districts. Many chipotle workers, many of whom have courageously continued staffing restaurants throughout the crisis, are coming forward to raise additional concerns about whether chipotle is adequately protecting its workers in the public firm Covid-19. One of them will be testifying tonight as well during the public comment period. I'd like to add that this has been an issue from the beginning of the company's response to the pandemic. In the first week of March workers at five new york city, restaurants went on strike after chipotle catherine, the next person I didn't hear the last part. What number was that I didn't hear the last part? Who can you put him back sorry? I realized I had gone over time here. No go. I think you were making a very important point and I think everyone needs to hear your points. Thank you. I appreciate that so I'll just continue. In the first week of March workers at five new york city, restaurants went on strike after chipotle managers, pressured workers to work sick with coronavirus symptoms, despite the mounting crisis of the pandemic, and studies that have come out since then show that there were likely already thousands of coronavirus cases in new york city. By that point, we only recently learned of these license applications and, unfortunately missed the June committee meeting, which is why we're here tonight, and so for all of the reasons mentioned, we ask that community board 12 oppose chipotle's application for restaurant wine licenses at 3781, broadway and 4240 broadway. Thank you, especially for letting me go over time, a little bit there. Thank you, mr reilly. Thank you appreciate your input. The next one up next public speaker and then that'll. You know wrap it up right because I have another important speaker to come. That's important! Yes, hi! This is eduardo. Zavaya speaking, can you guys hear me all right? Yes, you're, perfect. Hi I work with 32bj. I also have with me theodora who works for chipotle and she's, going to be giving a little quick testimony based on what shawn was saying and I'll be translating she's since she's speaking. Sorry, can you please spell your name and the name of the other speaker yeah sure, so my name is eduardo edu that part I have the last name, sorry so, z like and zebra e v like and victor a l, o s, okay, and then this the worker that I'll have here as well as theodore t e o d. Okay, yes, hello, my name is theodora and I work at chipotle on 355th ave in empire state building, I'd like to talk about the issues at my company that affect both workers and members of the public. Last month, along with co-workers from two other Manhattan restaurants, I filed a complaint with the occupational safety and health administration OSHA. So, as new york began shutting down in mid-march, I was on a previously scheduled vacation and did not return to work until April 6th. When I did return to work, I learned to several crew members from another store. 686 avenue, which had recently closed, were picking up shifts at my store. A co-worker from 686 staff told me that one of the crew members there have been diagnosed with coronavirus in late March days after working a shift at the store eduardo. This is the time so I appreciate you should just make your point and I'm sorry, because I just have to respect everyone else's time gotcha, so I so I guess just just to sum it up that yeah more or less that theodore was a part of a OSHA complaint and chipotle hasn't been doing enough to protect workers during the coronavirus. They haven't been following a lot of the requirements and just implementing basic things like sneeze guards to protect workers, and they also have like a lot of other outstanding issues related to fair work week, laws as well, and basically you know that you know theodore- has children and she's lives in her neighborhood and she needs to protect herself and her family and her community as well eduardo. Thank you very much, mr riley theodora. I think the public speakers are the pulse of our community. I really appreciate your input and I think it's going to hold weight into the weight up in our decisions. Thank you once again before we launch lsn. What number is it that they're talking about chipotle in 180th in in broadway that area there? I think it's on the minutes. I mean something number eight number, eight, it's the one at broadway 157th street, the other one is not yeah. The other one has been withdrawn. Thank you steve for christmas. I have a quick question yeah. I also have a question all right: should we get extra time since they're doing translation in spanish? What was that? I'm just wondering? I have extra time since she was doing translation in spanish, because if I had a double time, or at least like an additional minute or something like that- I don't know if that's in the rules, but given the fact that we're not providing translation as a community board. I think we should provide additional time for that. Well, we all we provide. We provide translations, but we didn't do it this time, but because we weren't prepared to have a bladder presentation, but I take your point and I'm willing to give another minute just because it's extremely reasonable request so eduardo. If you can have the lady speak again, we'll give you one more minute. Thank you, danielle eduardo! If you can mute yourself, darda's gone steve, eduardo, yes, foreign, so chipotle, never warned me or any of my co-workers at 350 that a new the new crew member is picking up shifts at our store. I've been exposed to coronavirus. My co-complaintance reported that chipotle managers never warned them that they had been exposed to co-workers that had been quarantined with suspected coronavirus and didn't take legally required precautions to protect workers and customers. Yeah edward, like to add, and just kind of like make the final statement. Well yeah. I think it was what we said before that yeah they're just not doing enough they're, not following some of the basic precautions. There was also a report in february that was released, describing how chipotle managers have pressured workers to work sick. So it's a company with a lot of issues as well. Okay, thank you really appreciate that. Thank you very much for your time as well. Yeah. Thank you danielle. You all credit goes to you now that we finalized our public section. Can I ask my question to eduardo or o'reilly mr reiner either or both okay? The can I go ahead now. Yeah, of course the the specific applicant for these two locations is chipotle mexican grill of colorado. Llc. Is that the same legal entity that owns the other establishments that you referred to and where she worked yeah? So I can answer that question. It is the same entity. Chipotle was founded in colorado, so that's where the name comes from, that's their formal legal operating name and they operate all of the 80-something locations that are here in the city. So this is. This is not a franchise with a separate owner. They're all they're, all owned centrally correct chipotle is corporately operated. They don't franchise, it's not part of their business model. Okay, that's important to know! Thank you! Thank you, steve eliasr. Yes, so I'm not asking a question about that. I just want for the because of the way the meeting records on zoom. I just want to sort of read into the public record. There are a bunch of people who are throwing up questions in the chat regarding extreme noise levels. What's being done about the overwhelming amount of trash lining, sidewalks and streets. I am concerned with the noise of more concern with the noise of parties than the noise of fireworks. Andrea arroyo saying street parties are louder and longer than ever they happen nightly and the noise is unbearable this year in southern washington heights. What is being done? Extreme noise is a public health issue. We've got somebody on hillside avenue, who's saying that, echoing that these are serious problems, we've got an anonymous attendee wanting to know why the 34th precinct isn't doing more about noise, and we've got somebody asking specifically about cars being left on jacks, which are dangerous. This is happening on hillside avenue and also a lot of marijuana smoking on the corner of hillside avenue in elwood. So I'm not sure why all of those folks didn't raise their hands to speak during the public session, but I felt that for our board members who may not be monitoring the chat, it's important for them to have the benefit of knowing that these are some of the questions and concerns that the public is raising. I I'm not looking to answer them. That's not procedurally appropriate, but I wanted to just give voice to those questions. Thank you lis. Thank you for all the work we're gonna have now Manhattan borough. Presidents, gail brewer, give us some updates on the hard work that she's putting in glad to have you girl. Thank you, mr chair, and thank you also for you and your colleagues participating in the uptown reopening town hall last night with boards 9 10, 11 and 12.. There were huge numbers of chat and q a and, to me, that's always a measure of interest and we're going to be trying to answer all the questions. So it was a very long, very detailed. Thank you because it was really helpful and people seem to enjoy it and we need to keep working on that. So much appreciated number two in terms of the restaurants. It's an ongoing discussion. I want to say three things that we've learned in the last I don't know half hour. One is that my understanding is that tomorrow morning the city is going to release the portal information. There are 3141 restaurants that have requested outdoor support. Dining in the Bronx is 240. Brooklyn is 591. Queens, 566, staten island 141 in Manhattan, no surprise 1603, and so we obviously have more almost double of anybody else. So all the questions that I know is on everybody's mind: how is this going to work and so on are more relevant in Manhattan than anywhere else. So, tomorrow morning the mayor is putting up a portal, as my understanding listing all the restaurants that I just mentioned in terms of the numbers, mapped and searchable in different ways. Number two: the issue that liz ritter just brought up and that I hear about every single community board is this tension between the need for the restaurants and the question of what they could or could not do, etc. People can use the bathroom of the establishment, I'm on the governor's recovery task force that came up at the town hall last night. Can that be done? And the answer is absolutely yes, but what the city is thinking of doing and thinking of is the word that I was told is a mediation process for restaurants that are having challenges and where there are complaints and supposedly to use oath or a private organization called jams which I probably should know, but don't and apparently they're willing to do the mediation for free, so community boards need to be absolutely front and center, as community board three said tonight, nobody ever consults the community boards and guess who is on the front line the community boards. So I just want to let you know that that's happening the third aspect. The fourth aspect of opening, is the stipulations. Now we have a wonderful beta NYC. As you know, it is a non-profit house in our office that focuses on data and they now have a list of all these stipulations, which I think nobody else has so just a little bit about opening. And, of course I want every restaurant to do well and we can have a further discussion, but that's the very quick version also on data. I know that housing is utmost of importance to community board 12 and all of us without getting into the wonderful work that's going on in albany and the city council and the fact that there's a new housing connect portal. I think you know all of that. What we're working on with again the same data emphasis is trying to get and we're getting closer from the housing court. The data not names, not specific addresses, but knowing where there are hot spots in terms of evictions or holdovers, or anything that could indicate that there's a challenge regarding this area and people getting evicted again, not a lot of details to give you right now. Just to give you a sense, I am absolutely focused on trying to use data to make people's lives better in terms of the census, because that's all about data. We know that we are doing a census- town hall, June 24th tomorrow from 3 30 to 5, with the library to talk about the census, we're a little bit about 54, but I can tell you but in Manhattan, but I can tell you that we were in the 60s 10 years ago. So what we're also doing data related. We now have a list of all the census, tracts, of course, and we're looking closely at the ones that have the lowest response rate, not necessarily washington heights, and anybody always do very well, but we're going to work and focus on those almost going person to person to try to get the rates to be up. Just to give you a sense of that issue, I'm always concerned about health. I think we all are. I heard some news today. If you look at the governor's dashboard you'll see that in some of the upstate counties where there is opening there's an uptick in kobet, I just say that too, because we all know that could be a possibility here. We do not want it. I have been pushing for a while on this issue of waste, we are 14 sewage treatment plants in the city of new york in the netherlands, with six days notice. Six days in advance, the notice is clear where there is a hot spot of Covid-19 or any other virus in the netherlands. There's no reason we can't do that here and so we're working with dep and trying to get them to do some purchasing of machines, hiring of staff. They have the lab to be able to analyze our waste here in the city of new york, not send it to California and stanford. We need real time right now, so I just mentioned that, because we need to supplement the tracers and supplement anything else. We know we're also working on organics. As you know, the mayor cut the pickup in the budget, but we are pushing at least have one organics drop off per community board, because if we lose that momentum again, it goes right to the landfill. I know you're upset about the board leadership, 101 land use being tonight, but we will find another time to do it when there are four boards tonight. So it wasn't the greatest night, but it was the only time that was available. Lots of people did sign up. We have one on the 25th on landmarks and one on the 29th on more advanced zoning, but we will find another time to do this, one in terms of all the great work that the protesters have done, just not in board 12, although I think you do have the best murals in the united states right on dyckman and that certainly to me, is part of protest. The black lives matter. We've got two locations where I believe July 1st of all goes well. Black lives matter will be painted in the borough of Manhattan. One is on foley square, which is right near african burial, ground and near our office, and without getting into all the specifics and the thousands of phone calls. It'll start July 1st and be done on July 4th and that's with professional paid artists as well as just people painting and then the second one is going to be on adam clayton powell, boulevard between 125 and 127, and that two is going to start on July 1st and will be done for the fourth and the two are complementing each other and it could not be more fantastic. So I think there's lots more. You know where to get tested. You know that we're still pushing on arts on the arts. The uptown group I want to thank you are amazing artists in inwood and washington heights. They've been part of all of this. Many phone calls with harlem washington heights and inwood bozo rivers put it together to me what's impressive about it is that everybody joins, but also the back and forth. Compliments support collaboration that has come out of it and I just want to say thank you very much, because we have lots more work to do, but I think it's been extremely helpful. We're all worried about the schools. My understanding is only 49 of the students can be in a school at any one time, because there just isn't any more space and we do need to have a decision made and how, in the world, are we going to have kids in school for a period of time and out of school for another period of time without getting into all the specifics, I think we can say it's a real challenge. Thank you very much and congratulations to board 12 on so many levels and I think it's great in terms of your public. I certainly want to work with miss rojas about her concern about what's going on in her neighborhood and, of course, all the other issues that you brought up thanks. Thank you again for your humility. You wait until the public speakers are finished so that you can hear exactly what's going on. So I more than commend you for that. So, thank you once again we're moving on. We have 26 resolutions to pass 26., so we're gonna have to be a as brief as we can humanly possibly can so. If we can just, I think most of the resolutions were sent over the weekend. Hopefully you guys have the time to read them over. As usual, licensing is usually the black ship of the family. I know that is israel and his committee tried it twice as hard as possible, so we're gonna, try and bang it up. Do an efficient job and kind of move along and move forward. I think the one first one I see on the agenda is business development. The resolution seeking targeting and equitable access to Covid-19 19 related small businesses. Are we rebuilding or rebuilding funding for washington heights in england yeah? I think the purpose, the main purpose of it is just to be able to, as we start begin, reopening making sure that there's equity maintained. So this was a resolution that was brought forward by tanya, and the committee made some modifications and we felt that it was prudent being that, as things are beginning to as businesses is starting to reopen to be able to start advocating for equitable processes in which we could but support our local businesses, whether it be via lenders or etc, but just make making sure that we're able to provide equitable access to communities of color within new york city, specifically district 12., so, okay, so that be the end of your presentation. Do people have any questions or friendly amendments or anything that they would like to add or comment about before we move forward to the next resolution presented by eliza reader, our fabulous secretary to the number one two and three, so we don't have any domingo. There were no questions for domingo, yes speaks. It speaks to how much effort tanya put into putting it together. I feel like it answered everybody's questions. Now he has the questions. Go ahead. Steve again is steve, asking a question: what's going on here, steve you gotta, unmute yourself. There you go yeah in the very last resolved in the very last sentence: the excluded workers, disaster income replacement fund bill has been introduced in the state senate. What was it who introduced it? This is tonya. I know that carmen de la rosa has been a champion of that particular bill. Then that means it was also introduced in the assembly right. So this says it was only introduced in the state senate was a so well. We can, we can definitely clarify, we could say the new york assembly in general. I think I think, a counterpart that she was working with. I can't recall the name introduced it in the senate, I'm not too familiar if it was introduced in the assembly, but that's something that we could clarify moving forward or I think a friendly amendment to just look into more information and provide more accuracy would suffice. Yeah, yes, and if calm is called, are you saying that carmen is the lead sponsor in the assembly? Well, I don't know who the lead sponsor is in the assembly. I did look up the bill. I did look up the bill itself and I have that information and the bill itself was introduced first in the new york state senate that I do know. I don't I can't speak to this. I know she's right now trying to gather support for correct assembly, because yeah she's been trying to gather all right, so the friendly amendment is accepted by both tanya and domingo right and what's the amendment and what's the amendment just like you know, the amendment would be to add the names of the senator, the name of the senator who introduced the legislation in the senate and the name of the assembly person who introduced it in the assembly. If I don't think, I don't think it was yeah, it wasn't, I think yeah and the number of the two bills. What do you think tanya? Well, it's pretty standard. Our I mean when we're citing legislation. We usually cite the name bill and who introduced it. And then, if you go to the website, you can click on get the same as if there's I mean I can't do that, no worries. I hear you liz, but talia wrote it. So might as well get her input, you know all right, tanya got it. So. Thank you. Thank you, steve for your questions, tania, for being so prepared and domingo for making the presentation so lisa your resolution, please! Yes, okay, so a couple of things I just wanted before I present the resolution. I just want to echo that in our committee we had a really real and I encourage you. Please read the minutes. We had a really robust conversation about barbecuing trash noise, various usages in the park and we will meet over the summer, which we don't usually do and are not required to do. But there are so many points of access with questions about parks, usage and it's really changing. We did get the report from the district manager that playgrounds are open. I just want to let people know that dog runs courts, ball fields. All of that are still closed. We made it really clear to the parks department representative in the strongest possible terms that we need to have dog runs reopen and that we need to have some recreational alternatives for people who would be using ball fields, but you know can't do to Covid-19. So I encourage people to a read those minutes and b come to our meeting on July 14th. In terms of a resolution, we had a marvelous presentation from the washington heights inwood food council regarding their urban gardening. We passed a resolution unanimously calling on supporting urban gardening in general and wanting to get a little bit more funding a little more land for more urban gardening. In the district we didn't propose particular sites. We don't have sites in mind. The resolution is just in support of urban gardening and in support of funding for urban gardening. I did get a couple of edits from one of the committee members to tighten up. The language doesn't change the meaning of it, so I'm not going to go into those specifics and I'm waiting to hear back from the washington heights inwood food council on exactly what their yield is and how many people they serve and how many, how much space they have and so we'll add that into a whereas just sort of by the numbers information. Any questions going, one going twice going: three yeah. Of course you do yes, steve in the fifth, whereas I would like to suggest that instead of saying inadequate, that you should say inappropriate and and that you should indicate due to soil contamination, slope, park, alienation and accessibility issues and then end the, whereas clause at that point, because I don't believe that the money had was ever transferred to d.o.e. Okay, that's fine! Can you send me that language, because I'm kind of juggling a bunch of things- and I don't have that screen open, but that sounds perfectly reasonable, yeah, no problem and in the resolve clause I would delete the commas that were housing yeah, that's fine, okay, very good and steve. One of the corrections that was sent in was that we were not sure that it had been transferred to the DOE, so that was right. Okay, thank you. We got we're moving on. We have waldies, who has his hand up, and you know, while these yeah we're going to take two questions and then wrap up the question. It's not necessarily resolution related, but it's more so parts related right. So it's somebody somebody's crumpling, something, and I can't hear anything. I'm sorry I mean not me, but I'm sorry for the noise. Okay, so yeah, I had a parks related question, not necessarily a resolution related question. But okay is that guidance as to like when people will be allowed to like play in the in the baseball field, then in the bath and when they're gonna put the ribs back up? So we don't know, and one of the things that you know I kind of feel a little bad for the parks department, because they're the ones that we're yelling at when we don't have the ability to use these facilities. But the parks department is making their decisions in accordance to guidelines that are coming from the mayor's office. So it's the mayor's office that is holding off on what can be used and when and what constitutes safe usage. So we've also reached out to the mayor's community affairs unit so that we can make clear to them that communities are really crying out for the ability to use. We've got 660 acres of parks and many playgrounds and sports facilities, and we need to be able to use them. So I know that's a long way of saying I don't know, but I don't know we're working on it. Okay, thank you for the response. You bet. Okay, tony okay, do I have anyone else before I move on to house houses, but no, I think I would like to commend liz because if folks didn't participate in that meeting, you would see what being somebody who brought everybody together and developed a constructive way of being able to take negative situations and not let community members go against each other, but identify issues and figure out how to commonly attack them. You know- and I think that was very greatly done- I left with the understanding that as a community, we must advocate for more garbage bins within our parks, but also being able to figure out how to have the community members also engage with anybody who they feel is doing something that is out of out of that would impact the area, but also letting folks know that this neighborhood, carrying effect of being able to call the police and falsely accuse people was, is not going to be tolerated. Thank you. I appreciate that. I do have one other really important announcement to make and I want. I want for people to really pay attention to this and spread. This word there's been a lot of information on facebook lately about you know, people posting photographs of parks that are strewn with garbage like totally trashed, and then there are literally hundreds of comments about. Why are people such slobs? This is disgusting and it's really negative and there have been many people who have commented in the threads things like that's really strange, because I was out in the park at six o'clock in the evening or at eight o'clock in the evening or at midnight, and it was clean and then all of a sudden, it's dirty. So we're not really sure on what exactly is happening. It seems based on this, the distribution pattern of the garbage and the condition of the of the garbage bags. It seems like it's a combination of people coming into the parks, removing the garbage bags from the cans ripping them open, scattering the garbage because they've been slashed and then having animals like raccoons and skunks, distributing it further. These are two very different problems, but both of those problems are very different from people being slobs and not cleaning up after themselves, which appears to actually not be the case. For the most part, people really do seem to be cleaning up after themselves. So while I don't condone garbage- and I certainly don't condone people taking garbage out of cans and throwing it back out onto fields, I want for everybody to be a little thoughtful about not accusing people of being slobs because in park after park after park, people do appear to be cleaning up after themselves and bagging their garbage. Thank you. Yes, housing and human services miranda resolution in support of the billionaire mark to market tax act. If you will yes, hi everyone, so I'll, just briefly go over our meetings past month, essentially, we started off by having a presentation done by our own naisha diaz. It was focused on inclusive communication in the human services field. We pretty much as entire committee loved it. We thought that it's something that should be really integrated into an orientation process. She is currently actually looking to go back and work with some of the members of the lgbt task force so to try and make sure that it is, you know, even more further inclusive of other language that we would like to have included in the future. The committee was really just looking forward to try and pass a resolution once we've gotten, you know a bit more feedback from the lgbt task force, so it's to try and present it on our own end and hopefully in the future, move it forward as even something that we use across the entire board. So you know I'm looking forward to that and hopefully just the entire board will be looking forward to have hopefully having a bit more of a conversation on what kind of communication we'd like to have being used across the entire board and secondly, I'll of course mention. We spoke a bit about the excluded worker relief fund, which has since then changed the name to billionaire mark to market tax act. We had a presentation done by the assembly member in the prior month, focusing on this bill that has since been introduced and also been co. I guess introduced in the state senate by senator jessica ramos this bill just to give everyone. I guess a fairly quick, brief way of explaining it. The act would establish a billionaire mark to market tax, taxing residents with 1 billion dollars or more in net assets, and direct revenue from such taxes into a worker bailout fund. Establishing a worker bailout fund would provide workers traditionally excluded from wage protection programs access to unemployment benefits. We specifically noted that this is crucial to our community, given the kind of work that really occurs across the entire community board, the community district, and we recognize how really how instrumental this could be in keeping many of the residents that have already been. You know having a difficult time paying rent, as is in this community, so we you know. We of course want you to please review and let us know what you think of this individual resolution. Lastly, I'll just mention that we did talk a bit about what has been presented in the city council, the city council bills, there's two one has since passed. The other has really been kept on hold. It refers back to the legislation that our former council, our other council member mark levine, had mentioned. I think a lot of people have realized that it is, quite frankly, not gonna present many of the resolutions that we would like to see, and I think that there's a bit more of a conversation needs to be had in regards to the passage of such legislation. Also just note that for everyone really, we had a resolution that was passed a while back. That's referring to the refugee safety net fund resolution we've since spoken, and we've had really everyone agree on getting this already passed for the entire board. It is essentially referring to a language that was previously voted on and supports, making sure that we are allocating money in the city's budget so as to ensure that we're providing any refugees that are potentially moved to new york city as a result of the federal government's responses you know so as to get essentially aid. In the event that happens, we saw that in the aftermath of hurricane maria that had left a number of recently resettled refugees and immigrants seeking opportunities that were not necessarily being made available, and so this is just continuing that kind of work that we've already presented prior to everyone, and we just want to make sure that everyone is aware that this is now going to be essentially passed for this board. Thank you at home, okay, thank you, quick question or observation scenario or two of them going through the resolution. It wasn't immediately clear to me what the billionaire mark to market tax act was. Nor was it clear what the you know: the intro that was you know, presented by carmen and by jessica. What is included in that? Your comments made that clear to me, and I think it would, you know, strengthen the result if you just added a whereas that said, you know the mark the billionaire mark to mark attacks that formerly, as xyz, is intended to achieve. You know x and the you know. The legislation that's proposed by carmen de la rosa and by jessica ramos is intended to achieve. You know so that it's clear because there are, there are a number of sources of things that are cited in their zone, but it doesn't go to the heart of explaining what it is we're supporting. I would also point out that the mention of the unemployment among foreign born growing by 31 between february March, compared to 16 native one. I don't think anyone would be surprised to know that you know nativeborn varies greatly depending upon you know racial issues, so I'd be curious to know what the unemployment is when you take native born and you break that down along racial alliance to see how closely some of the experience of people of color might parallel the experience of people who are foreign born. So are you asking then and correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like then an amendment and if there's specific language that you would like to use, then just let me know I mean I'm more than happy to try and well. I would say two things I would say the you know going back to my initial point. Your introductory comments that provide some background on you know what the tax act is, which strengthen the resolution by explaining what it is, because the reso actually does not explain what that tax act is. So I think you know that would help, and I would suggest that as a friendly, you know friendly amendment and I would say that, and I mean you're there are a number of sources cited lots of stats and I think in res, in whereas number eight, the stat that is cited, comparing the unemployment among foreign-born and may be a little deceptive in that it captures all native born and doesn't break that down by a race. So, if you're going to make, if you're going to cite that statistic, I would suggest breaking it down so that we have a better sense of what the experience of native born is by race, so that at least you know we can get a sense of if foreign-born are experiencing things similar to native borns, who are of color or if across the board, the experience is dramatically different, all right yeah I mean I just want to point out one thing. However, I think that when we're talking about how this bill relates to the public, it's supposed to be talking about who's typically excluded from services right, so I do see the point you're making about race. I think it's something that we can add as aware as, but I don't think that you know what you're talking about is really dealing with the concerns about being native born, or you know, foreign born right for that just clarify it and for the result itself just add some language, as you just said, you know clarifying what is what its intent is. You understand what he's trying to say what he's trying to say is to make sure that you clarify exactly the concept of yeah, so just that. Okay, so again, it just seems like you want an amendment to include further language and just another, whereas yeah I mean basically you're saying it verbally, just whatever you're saying just add it as a, whereas to the resolution, okay, all right and being that it's okay, I'm sorry to jump in here, but I think the reason why wayne is not giving you specific language. Is you ariel are the expert on this and you said so beautifully what it was. You were trying to do that. Why would we try to improve upon your beautiful language, just write down what you said that made an abundant amount of sense and throw that into the reso as an intro, so that the rest of what follows has some context. So I yeah. I hear that and that's why I'm saying I think it sounds like an amendment. I will go ahead and just write down something now. I think it sounds as if we're going to have to just make a vote, because it's an amendment, no it's a friendly amendment, if you're good for that, you can just you can just put that in you can accept an additional whereas, yes, because the amen, the amendment that wayne is proposing is not anything that changes that materially changes the resolution, it's a it's a modification as to form to clarify the language that follows he's not proposing a substantive change, even though it's a bunch of words. So if you're, if I could interject at this point, please do thank you so much. Your point is very well taken. The only thing point I want to make is this: new verbiage has to be done tonight because we actually have to vote on the actual words tonight. It's a very bad policy to go. Oh we'll add this in the future, because so, if you agree with that, I think that's going to happen. Let's just move forward with the rest of the contract. You reiterate what I'm saying is: ariel has already spoken the words, so I mean we heard what you know. The added language that I'm suggesting is what he already said when he reviewed the resolution, I'm saying if you simply take that and add it, you know, as you know, text to the resolution. You strengthen it by giving it context. Okay great, so we agreed so ariel just get to work. Hopefully you'll finish it within the next couple of minutes. Before we move on to our next public safety, no landing news, yeah wayne you're next, the resolution on the board of standards and appeals. Okay, so thank you eliezer, so the I think I've spoken on two prior occasions about this board of standards and appeals special permit, nc8 zoning districts, schools, residential community facility uses are not permitted as of right, so the washington heights inwood community music charter school, which is currently actually co-located on in a public school ms. What is it 238 328 rather on 164th street at edgecombe? They are moving out of that building into their own building. They went through a search that included about a dozen properties and the property that is suits the bill, both in terms of square footage and configuration of the building, but also in terms of price. Is this building at 506 west 181st street in order for that building to be used as a school? Since it's in a c8 district, the board of standards and appeals has to issue a special permit and, as I pointed out in the past, I think it was 10 years ago. So it's not recent. The community board passed a resolution asking the department of city planning to in fact, rezone most or all c8. Zoning districts in washington would, for the very reason that I stated, because they do not allow for a range of uses that is conducive to what we need, which is to say, had they accepted on this. The special permit would not be needed. The atlantis committee met with the applicants in february. There were both environmental and traffic studies that were not yet completed. We referred the applicants to meet with the traffic and transportation, health and environment and youth and education committees, so that those committees could speak in more detail on aspects of the project that is under their purview. Those meetings took place in may and then the applicants came, you know back to us, the environmental studies or the remediation work. That's required with the environmental studies need to be signed off. Finally, by dep the transportation studies, including any traffic mitigation, has to be signed off by DOT. The board of standards and appeals will not issue a special permit until you know both dep and dht provide their sign offs at the June committee. You know project further and voted to support the special permit, and you know noting a number of things that you know the school already exists in the community and it will you know relocating it. You know, allows the families and students who currently are you know using the school to continue to use it. The renovation actually will bring us a about 273, not us. It will include a 273 seat, theater, that's accessible from the ground floor, and you know that is a type of facility that is greatly you know needed in the community and when we met with the applicants in february, we pointed out that both the community board and various community-based organizations would be very interested in being able to access it after you know school hours, so I mean at the end of the day. The resolution you know covers it provides you with background on. You know the school, the project, you know the some of the zoning issues and you know the land use committee's support. We asked in supporting it that the applicants you know continue to coordinate with the committees of the community board as the project moves forward as it as activities at the site begin in terms of construction, then, as they get ready to occupy it, and we also ask that they coordinate with you know, local nearby community-based organizations, of which there are a couple that are literally next door as well as small businesses and the you know the washington heights bid as they you know, as they are moving to 181st street. So they get a sense of being part of that strip, and we also you know going back to our point. We also encourage the school to you know, make the auditorium available for community events, including local theater and performing arts productions. Thank you great. I think it covered most of any materials or any questions that we may have yeah. We have steve simon, steve simon, you mean the steve simon, hello, yes, steve, you're, okay wayne is a very good resolution. It's really all encompassing, but in the minutes don't we say that the auditorium has 400 seats. The plans, however- and I think I shared this with you via email- the plans show 273 seats. There may be other areas in the front area going towards the stage that per code you can have movable seats that we're bringing up with the fixed seating capacity is 273.. Okay, very good. Thank you. Moving along mr curtis young. Finally, hello. I've been calling you curtis you've been calling me well, I'm here all right well, thank you all very much. Obviously it's been a lot going on in the arena of public safety. We had a very vibrant meeting this past month and we tackled a lot of issues, some of them. You have heard tonight, including the fireworks and other noise complaints we've received within the past few weeks, because there's been so much going on with the demonstrations and protests in standing up against police violence and brutality, I invited local elected officials to come and share their perspective on what was going on so carmen robert al mark levine and representatives from germany office also attended. So I thought it was very helpful to have their voice and to show solidarity in this very difficult time. So one of our agenda items involved the ccrb, the repeal of 50a, which obviously has happened already. So we have two resolutions this evening. One is in support of the full repeal. Our committee discussed the repeal of ccrb back in the fall, so I was happy to hear that the city council moved quickly and the governor everyone in support of this appeal. You know we voted on it and then it became it was repealed the next day. So I did include a resolution just to show that we acted and we discussed it and we did come to a consensus on its repeal, also as a as a committee. So that's before you this evening, and the second resolution involves the reallocation of funding for NYPD. This is obviously another one of those issues that is a byproduct of what's been happening around the country, as people begin to think about reimagining public safety reimagining, our community policing, we're not advocating for a lack of resources, we're advocating for budget equity, and we really believe that there's a way to you know to support our community maintain public safety with a certain amount of money and being cut from the budget. That amount is one billion dollars. We're not the first community board to ask for this cut to support a funding. Cut. Cb9 has just passed a resolution in support of cutting this this money from the budget. So I'm asking for your support this evening. There were a few of you who sent questions to me in advance, and hopefully I'll answer them and via email. So I'm open to your comments, questions and concerns on this topic right now. Thank you very much all right. We have wayne yes swain so curtis. Concerning the the resolution supporting the repeal of 50a. One of two things I mean since it is, it has now been repealed. I wonder if reso is moved and if it is not, would it make sense to add language pointing out that you know the governor, the city council, whomever has acted to, you know, repeal it and we support those actions. Well, I kept it for a particular reason. I did. I debated that myself for several days thinking that it would be moved because the action had already occurred, but I felt it was still important for us to to show our support for its repeal and also to reinforce our commitment to the issue and also it also mentions several other issues as well such as you know, you know overall, reform efforts in general, so there are tons of reform efforts happening right now at the state level, and I did mention a few of them in the reso, so we can add additional language to clarify. You know our. You know expectations, but I do think it was important to just move forward with the resolution because it was discussed in committee and our committee voted, so I don't want to make a decision to not write it after we had already voted on it at our community level right. So I guess to my second part of my question. Since we are you know keeping it. Would it not make sense to add language to resolution acknowledging the actions that have already been taken along the lines of what we're supporting? Yes, okay, yes, I can most certainly do that, and I can accept that as an amendment, meaning that, on whatever day the state legislature, the governor signed this and choosing yeah he's got it right. Perfect done. Thank you, kurdish. Sorry. Next up is liz and wrapping up just dovetailing on wayne's. That is exactly what I was going to say and in terms of a specific language suggestion there would be a where an additional, whereas I would add it as the last, whereas on whatever the date was the legislature passed whatever the legislation number was with the senate and the assembly same as, and the governor signed it and then changed the there now, therefore be it resolved to, instead of encouraging them to pass applaud them for having taken that action, and then everything else in the rezzo should be fine, to the extent that it's calling on them to take positions on other things. But I agree with your thinking that it is important to reflect you know only the boards we speak. The board speaks through rezo. So I think it's important for us to capture this moment in time that this is the position that we had. Okay, yes, of course, so do we have anyone else, catherine! So we move on. We have daryl, who else there's daryl, waldis and steve now, oh steve, daryl, wildlife and steve and then wrap it up move on to thank you from you. I just had a question curtis, I noticed for the budget resolution. There were two people, I'm sorry you're breaking up yeah kind of like he was talking about the resolution. Daryl. Can you repeat that again you got caught on? Oh sorry, there were two people in the budget resolution that abstained. Oh yes, I am. That was because oc came late and there, and so she wasn't there for the full conversation, and you also explain abstain as well, but he didn't provide any details as to why he abstained. Okay, thank you. So while this is next or you said, someone else, hey guys curtis, thank you for all the work you've been doing and and for doing two resolutions, and probably fifty I know, there's a lot of public safety issues and I'm sorry about throwing another one at you and also kind of like aligns in parallels with parks. Specifically what happened in fort tryon, I just wanna, like I guess, comment or a question or something to that degree hanging that occurred. I know that it's kind of it's a really dense situation when, like and conceptually, I know it happened. I believe it happened, probably after your meeting or so I know, I'm sure, that's why you didn't speak to it, because I'm sure you know you do a good job of talking about that and so does liz. But so I just want to like speak to that. Just I guess acknowledge the fact that this did happen in our community and this is kind of worrisome. I went bike riding with some friends through the park and you know they mentioned their worry about it and they asked me like if I knew anything about you know like any facts about the situation, but just really concerning from a you know: public safety issue from a public safety perspective. Excuse me, but just like overall just the incident is just bizarre and eerie, so just wanted to just comment on it: yeah, okay! I can actually kill that one okay, you can go out. I had something else to add, but okay, so that incident actually happened on the morning of our of our committee meeting. So we did speak about it. Briefly. At our committee of the parks committee, it happened on June 9th, which was, and we met later that evening. I have subsequently had the opportunity to have several conversations with people in the parks department and also with several people at the 34th precinct. I spoke with curtis about it as well the precinct it's part of an ongoing investigation, so the precinct is not able to comment a lot on the details of the incident, but they are still investigating it and they're not investigating it. In a yeah lady we're looking into it like they're, clearly they're clearly still investigating it. It's an active investigation. One of the things that I think is important to keep in mind is that the family, through an intermediary reached out to the people who are organizing the the protestation protest that was happening on saturday. The flyer for that used the word lynching and the family reached out to the organizers and requested that language be removed, which they then did do and turned it into a blm protest which is appropriate. The other thing that I think is really important to keep in mind is there are a couple of other incidents nationally of black men hanging themselves or being hanged in public and in the ones in other states. The families are asking for the local pd to investigate. In this case the family is not asking that. So I don't have information, because the investigation is still ongoing, but it sounds like when the investigation is concluded. We there will be information that is made publicly available, which will help to make this make a little more sense than it makes right now. Yeah. I think that's enough for that. I don't have anything to add. I think you know there's obviously a lot going on and it's you know it's a very challenging charging charge time for all of us, and I think we are all learning new details about everything that's going on in the community, including the you know, the fireworks and other issues each day, everything's changing you know. I just got an email earlier today from the precincts, I'm very happy with the work and the partnership that we have built with our precinct captain in the 33rd. As I say each month I got an invitation and they are hosting a roundtable discussion. The first of many I'm assuming a roundtable discussion to talk about community relations and what's been happening here. You know with fireworks and other public safety complaints, so I will be attending I've shared that with our assistant, chair danielle, I'm hoping to show join with me and don't there are countless others who've been invited to this roundtable, but we are we're doing the we're doing we're trying to collaborate as much as possible to ensure that we're tackling these issues. I've received emails from people. I know there's a lot of people watching and I you know I have read them and I I'm trying to filter through them and help as many as much as I can with helping people who send me individual concerns and complaints, especially with the noise and fireworks. Okay, I think steve had a question. No, I think faye was first, oh okay. I don't know yesterday say: hey fay, you have to unmute yourself. Can we go to steve then, because she, you know, and then angel also has his hands. Let's go to angel first because steve hats yeah, he has participated more than anyone else. Angel have a two questions. One is procedural. Then I have my actual question. If there's an issue that is public safety and related that I'd like to bring up, is this the moment when I would do that or do I wait for you because you have to wait for yourself all right? Yes, thank you. Katie for new business. I'm sorry! There's too many people saying you're here you have to meet yourself, hey. I know I'm trying go ahead. Ask a question: can you hear me? Yes, I hear you hello. I hear you. Yes. Can you hear me? Yes, I think I think she cannot hear us. Does asian yeah we're waiting? Oh boy! Well, okay, all right! You hear me. Yes, I cannot hear you. Then you have a problem, good idea, we'll see whatever. Yes, we can hear you. Can you hear us as the question to me to himself, so I think that will be angel. Is that a question? Is there anything related to public safety resolutions, or is it something related to something else? It's not related to the resolution. I just didn't know the procedure, so I just have to wait till new business yeah. Okay, thank you very much. So we're gonna move along. Hopefully we can get your your system fixed. Can you put everyone back on mute because there's someone that has a background noise that is probably killing everyone else right and steve? What's your question yeah, I have a comment and on the 50a and a I have comments on both of them on the 50th resolution. The fourth, whereas is a really is not relevant? We when we do these resolutions. Every resolution has been passed on by a committee and we don't- and we don't refer to that- that's not a that's, not a point to be making that's fine. You can just delete that, whereas and you're putting in a new warehouse there anyway. My greater concern is with the other resolution, about the one billion dollars being reallocated from the police department. What you're saying in the resolution is at the heart of the police department's budget is really 5.6 billion. Well, yes, and the other 5.3 billion are really fixed costs that can't really be. You can't really apparently reduce those. So what we're suggesting here is that one billion be cut from a from basically the five point: six billion dollar budget- sure, because, oh god, that's 18 percent of the police department's budget. That sounds to me like that. Really you're really caught cutting it to the heart of the police department. No, I do yes, okay, and I did I don't. I think it's too easy to just say, cut a billion dollars without really knowing where it's going to come from, and it seems like this is really a pretty deep cut to to the agency, and I think we need to have more. Maybe we need to have more information as to how the police department will be able to sustain such a cut and how would be able it would be able to function. It's too easy to say that social workers and counselors and outreach staff can replace the police officers. I agree that they shouldn't have to respond to deal with homeless issues and mental health disorders, and but I don't see how that's gonna, take how that's gonna be able to reduce their questions steve. So what's your ass? I my ass cause. I don't. I don't see how this is gonna work and- and I I'm very reluctant- I'm very reluctant to support it. Okay, so you have an opportunity to vote yes or no so whatever, and then I also have an opportunity to voice my opinion, which I just did yes, thank you yeah. Thank you very much enjoy then. Can I add something I just want to offer mention, and I don't know this is not specifically mentioned in the in the reso, but this is not. These are not our ideas like we I mean. I guess these ideas have come up several times on the board, but also there are many non-profits. There are many elected officials that have these same ideas and so we're sort of just reiterating things that have already been mentioned by partners that doesn't make it right, yeah and also I just want to actually also thank you to my thank you danielle for adding that okay. Thank you, the actual budget. This is that those were the figures from fy20. The figures for fy21 is six billion, so just cutting you know one billion equals five, so it's not going to end up being less than five billion dollars. That takes us back to, I guess, maybe four or five years ago, when that budget was about that amount of money with the same number of around roughly the same number of officers, so their budget has increased over time. There's been an increase in their budget and their operating expenses, but they can operate at their at their current level and so we're just asking for budget equity. We're asking for people to consider or reimagine how we use the funding. That's given to our law enforcement agency, we're not saying they should not exist. We're not saying that they're! You know that they don't deserve the money that they're receiving we're, saying simply that you know there are a lot of other issues also happening in our community. You know. Education, for example, is going to be cut by 800 million dollars so and we- and we know that as our Manhattan board president mentioned earlier, there are going to be issues as we go back to school and cutting education for that amount of money and not considering a larger cut for the NYPD is not justice, so we're advocating for just a more equitable allocation of funding, we're not trying to do a disservice to and our agency. You know we work well very closely with NYPD. So that is not our goal of this resolution. It's more so a resolution, that's focusing on creating a more equitable allocation of our overall resources in the city. We also spend 250 million dollars on police misconduct. So when you add the 250 million dollars in misconduct each year that is paid by the taxpayers- and you add that to this amount of money- you know the numbers just don't add up. So that's what okay, so guys. Just a quick note point of order: this is a zoom meeting anytime, someone is speaking and someone just barges in you actually breaking out all the communication flow here. So it's almost it's just kindly just to raise your hand and just wait for your turn, because I'm getting four five six people at the same time speaking so, let's just kind of like you know, go back to bases and just speak once at a time, paul curtis. Thank you very much and we're going to move along. It's 9 o'clock. Almost to the licensing committee resolutions. We have some about 24, 23, isidro, there's some that were already passed for March. We did not vote on those resolutions in March because we had the Covid-19 19 presentation instead of passing any votes or approving any votes in March, so we're going to try and do our best to move right along the list, make our comments as questions as close as we can and try to make a productive resolutions out of this 20 plus resolutions that I have here. So you see draw thank you chair, so I wanted to rehash a bit what elisa said about phase two. Please understand if you do see a restaurant serving a dinner inside or perhaps food inside, that's not allowed, and if you see something that is way out of hand, please let the merchant know right away, because the salmon from the sla is very steep talking about ten thousand dollars minimum and they also risk losing the license. We expecting that for phase three. There will be perhaps at least a 50 capacity for our restaurants, and you know we hope that will be the beginning of opening up the whole complex of our food industry. So just a quick note, we might meet for committee of the hall, perhaps in July and double decision made by the chair and the rest of the executive committee. I wanted to ask mr chair for the office staff that, when we send out a notice about to change the method of operations that this be more specific, in the sense that, if you're going to ask for the committee to request or to allow perhaps a dj karaoke, that this be stated because oftentimes, it's just in general terms about math operations, and that covers a lot of different items. So we would like the staff to be more specific when we send out the public notice, but you know we can work with them. Yeah. Just one take point. So, as you stated, we have resolutions for March that were passed by committee, but not by the general board meeting. So we had some renews most of our renewals new licenses, some withdrawals when we requested stipulations, as we usually do that they be brought to the office. All of them have brought the documents and the office has received a set of documentations for the resolution in June. Very short, there were eight three renews, you know very basic licenses. It was not a drug and again all the simulations that were required by the committee have been submitted to the office so no reversal in the resolutions. I must say that I'm very concerned about the comments made by mr sean o'reilly sean spoke about against chipotle very concerned about all the things that are going on. We would love to have sean and, of course, his guests to come to a licensed committee. So that way there will be an opportunity for a chief polit to respond to some of these allegations. We want to hear like face to face what you know. Each body has to say, because it's only fair but very disturbing comments and I'm very concerned about moving forward as we deal with that chipotle in the future. Just shortly. Mr chair just wanted to thank rosie for submitting the minutes for June very helpful. Thank you rosie. So much and at this point I would refer to the minute, but we'll open up for some questions open up the floor for at least five questions on this 20 plus resolutions all right. Well, we have. I have a point of order. Sort of the my agenda does not have the resolutions from March; it only has the ones from June, so I don't know about the other ones. It was a separate attachment. Yes, okay, thank you. I will look for it. Thank you so, okay, I guess oc, doesn't have a question anymore, so liz and then steven speak simon, sorry, yeah, thank you isidro for your work on all of these resolutions and thank you rosie for your minutes. I just want to speak briefly. This is a statement, not a question about chipotle. It's true that it would have been very helpful if they had come to the committee meeting, but without addressing whatever are the labor issues. I've never really understood why chipotle has to have liquor. They are the only fast food place that has this sure I, like a margarita with my you know, taco salad as much as the next person, but I like a beer with my burger, and I can't get that at mcdonald's. So I don't understand why chipotle has liquor licenses. I have always objected to chipotle's liquor licenses. I will be objecting to it this evening and I would encourage my colleagues to do the same point well made and we'll take them. Thank you, yeah. Let me on the chipolte question: is it possible to sidrow to to table it and have the have it go back to the committee, so you can have a full discussion with both parties at the next meeting. I'm not sure. If that is procedurally acceptable, I would defend a question to berlin. If that's the case, then I'll proceed with that request. First. Well, I think it all depends on when the sla is whether the sla will hold off acting on the application. They usually give us 30 days. So you know, then time is an issue here, so we should proceed with it assistant, okay, all right, then let me let me ask you about, I, don't I don't. I don't think that I got the minutes of the March meeting. So could you just explain why the committee objected to the thai restaurant in number six and in number 10 if the closing hours are being extended to 4 a.m? Does that mean that the backyard sitting area that people would be out there until 4 a.m and then also explain why the committee objected to number 17. so, on your first question, number: six and you're referring to for June right, no March, the six. We didn't object to allah thai. No, we did not object. It says your resolution of objection. I don't have the menace here with me, but that should that should be changed to a possibly fold. Thank you for bringing that up by steve, because on my record I have that it has been passed. Thank you. Okay, very good, wait. What was that agenda item number six for the March 11th meeting the resolution states. That is a negative vote, but I have my notes here that resolution passed. So it's a it's a type on my on my program: okay and the inwood beer and garden. You know they have a backyard area which is right up against the the apartment building and behind it. If does it, if we're changing the closing hours so that they they stay open until four in the morning, does that mean people are gonna? Be sitting out there until four in the morning? No, so the two asked there the first ask was to approve the enclosure of the patio. Then they will request later on when that party is completed for the hours they're going to operate outside the hours that they requested of for 4 am has to deal with the inside once and if that will be approved, the patio enclosure, they will come back to the community report to request specific hours for the patio, okay, very good and number 17. Why are we objecting to that? To that one number 17., that's no shot. They didn't show up, but okay, very good. Thank you. Thank you. Kathy did you say we had another person that was gonna, ask yeah. We have jamison, but how many reso's are there for licensing? I just see eight. So that's eight for June this one. This is 18 for March, okay, there's an additional attachment, daniel okay! Thank you today. Can you you're sorry actually 16 for March, because two was withdrawn, there's someone that have been withdrawn. Yes, thank you all right, jay go ahead! Yeah! I didn't receive any of this information at all about these licenses. I suppose I should have mentioned that before the meeting, but I just don't have this information to evaluate it. Okay, do you have a working email, jay yeah? Perhaps that's something that the office can work with and making sure that you get set documents? Okay, maybe that will check your email address. Perhaps something is not going out all right, we'll forward it again now james? Well, somebody did that same for you I'll, try and look at it during the meeting, but I don't I don't know if I'll have time to vote on these resolutions, questions ones, questions. If there's no more questions, I just want to highlight a meeting that was had that we had with D.O.T concerning the outside sitting. It went really well. We had many community board members present there, including I'll distinguish that girl brewer was there supporting our local restaurants. So thank you so much guy and I hope that you all go out enjoy yourselves and support our local russians. Thank you so much eli. Thank you. Thank you. So much liz time for roll and rent brawl. My favorite part, yes, sir dude, okay, so you're going to be voting on lettered resolutions, a through f and then there are a bunch of licensing resolutions. I am referring to them by number. So for June, there's licensing, one two, three, five, six and eight numbers four and seven were withdrawn, and then for March we have licensing 1 through 11 and 14 through 17, and I am referring to those by licensing March and the number so we're licensing June and the number licensing March and the number one quick thing ariel is back on ariely wanted to say something: liz based on the friendly amendment that steve, oh, yes, yeah. So I just want to clarify, because there seems to be a bit of confusion here, there's going to be two different whereases, the first, whereas is in reference to those being foreign born and those being already native, born the, whereas that was asked to be included, is so as to specifically highlight the disproportionate impact between for specifically black and brown communities. The language that I've tried to include would go, whereas the impact of the pandemic has exacerbated the issues of disproportionately higher rates of unemployment among black and brown communities and then left to continue going and so forth. Does that seem to be the intent of asking for that change in language? That makes sense to me. Does that make sense to you wayne? Well, first, let me unmute myself, I mean in general. It makes sense. I was looking more specifically at a statistical breakdown which may not be readily available at this time. Okay, yeah, I yeah, I mean I have to start researching that unless that's readily available, that's you know yeah. I just would like to interject with a parliamentary observation concerning jay's dilemma. If he cannot evaluate the March list of licensing resolutions in a manner that he feels comfortable with, he can abstain on every single one of them and that's basically the best he can do, because he only has four choices and basically only three so that that's the parliamentary solution, the only one we have is his predicament. Thank you, okay! So then, just going back to the aforementioned amendments- and what I would also mention is that what I've put as a last, whereas is whereas assembly bill a10414 introduced in the assembly by assemblymember, carmen delarosa and his companion senate bill s, 8277, introduced by senator jessica ramos, known as the mark to market tax act, establishes a billionaire mark to market tax, taxing residents with one billion dollars or more in that assets and directs revenue from such tax into a worker bailout fund, as well as establishes a worker bailout program providing workers traditionally excluded from wage protection programs. Access to unemployment, therefore, be. It sounds good. Okay, great thank you, so we can move that along and barbara. You have your hand raised. I was I'm a little confused about the licensing, I'm trying to look at the general meeting agenda and seeing, if I have it straight okay, but it sounds like there are several people who didn't get the or who can't easily access the agenda for the March items. So could somebody from the office please just re-blast that attachment to everybody so that instead of distracting ourselves with scrolling through our phones and whatnot, the people who already have it they can ignore the email, the people who don't have it they need to get it so that we can move on. I'm sorry in the meantime. In the meantime, people can look at an email from paula on June 17th at 2, 16 p.m. June 17th at 2, 16 p.m. Just this morning at 11 06 for the March items that was just separately right today at 1106 from chanel barbara, this morning's email, where it says, there's an image with the agenda and the second page of the second image under the June includes numbers one through eleven, okay, the. Meanwhile, what else? What I'll? Well I'll do that then I'm gonna get at least one or two. First of all, barbara tell me tell me when you don't have it. I don't have anything from at 1106 this morning. No, I don't have it either. So just do what liz said: resend it yeah. I don't have it either: okay, so yeah! Okay. So, let's just move forward all right, so I have four committed reports, starting with mary, fay and debbie. So let's just do those and then we can get back to doing our role on our voting role. Can you hear me? Yes, you can hear me yeah. We can hear you we can. Yes. Can you hear me? Yes, mary perfectly, I don't think she can hear us, I'm not hearing yeah. I can I can hear talking, but I can't hear an answer to my question. Yes, we are okay, all right, so the committee is still working on trying to see what we can do to these. The residents of isabella geriatric center and they've asked us to that. They need magazines and some simple reading picture books, both in both languages, english and spanish, and we've gotten a pretty good response. Liz has been thank you, liz, instrumental in tapping some other sources that she has and so we're in the process of gathering materials to deliver to isabella. If anybody on the you know on the board has any friends or personal magazines, both english and spanish, or any kind of spiritual reading material. If you can deliver them to isabella to the security office and tell them that for the recreation department from the community board so that we get credit workers, do I appreciate that? Thank you. I'm still talking a lot about food access for seniors and there seems to be quite a number of sources, but there are still issues, especially with people that are getting food delivered to them by the city. The food, the quality of the food is poor and also they're, sometimes getting meals that need to be heated up. They don't have a microwave, so you know provides difficulty there still having some concerns about not being able to get our seniors in the community that usually attend our meetings to access the meetings, because they don't have the equipment to do so and we're talking about wondering if there's a possibility, we can do something on youtube because most seniors have you know at least a cell, a cell phone. You know a regular cell phone and possibly can access youtube so trying to look into some way of doing it, still concerns about seniors and disabled, having difficulty accessing stores and banks etc. Due to long lines and having you know, some stores have hours for seniors, but they're so early in the morning that they're just not suitable, and I have emailed ethedro and domingo to ask for their involvements, and you know, suggestions for helping to at least have some resolution for this to make it a little bit easier. Transportation issues continue to be a problem and multiply because the buses are full in the back, not allowing any social distancing and also there are still bus drivers refusing to open the front door for the disabled. I talked earlier in the meeting about the city bike, frontal being the stations being placed on sidewalks, making narrowing the path for pedestrians and wheelchairs and walkers, and I hope that they will follow through on you know not making it impossible to, for you know for people in wheelchairs and walkers to be able to pass through those areas. Cooling centers are have been. You know talked about, they said they were going to open cooling centers, but then now there's apparently according to information I found out is that cooling centers will not be open unless there is a heat wave and the heat wave, as opposed to a succession of three days in a row of 90 degree, weather they're, staying at 95 now three days in a row of 95 plus weather for cooling centers to be open. So you know sorry, no! I was just saying wow. I was just oh okay, yeah, that's what I say so forget the cooling sensors. You know it's a shame, because there are a lot of people who are not eligible for the hra air conditioners that don't have air conditioning, because you know it's. You know it's very expensive to have an air conditioner running, but anyway be that as it may. We also talked about our capital expense budget because we wanted to get a head start on these things, and one of the issues that came up with the capital budget is that we want to have system-wide upgrade of various senior centers to improve connectivity for wi-fi and telecommunications services be number one rather than number three as it has done, and then the other two would follow now. The third item on capital was providing funding to construct, affordable, accessible housing for seniors. We're also hoping that the housing committee is going to have that on their budget request as well, because we really need to have affordable senior housing as well. As you know, affordable housing in general, on the expense budget side, we added a new item and that's to expand mental, which will be number one on the expense budget, expand mental health services for seniors. You know with this pandemic and people having lost so much in terms of you know their ability to be a part of the community depression and losing people, their loved ones and friends. It's going to be a really important thing and we're also already seeing you know signs of increasing depression and anxiety among the seniors and we're hoping that health and environment committee will also have that high on their priority list. The committee agreed unanimously to meet over december, both in July and august because of the ongoing issues for seniors in the community, and we will be meeting on first thursday of July and the first thursday of august at 10 30 in the morning, and thank you all thank you mary and have a good summer. Everybody, yes, don't go to aruba, it's not safe. We have daryl and jay with questions yeah hi, just one quick statement, mary, I know when I was at the transportation committee meeting. I did ask about the city bike, ada accessibility and they basically guaranteed. That was a foot more than is required. So I just want to let you know that and then also with isabella. I dropped off about three dozen magazines there last week and they just seemed reluctant to take them. So I don't know who's communicating with the front desk, but they may want to talk to them about that. Okay, I'll I'll. Take care of that. Thank you. Thank you for taking them up. There appreciate it. Are we ready to take the votes of it? Liz? Barbara? Are you ready, ellie? I have a quick question. Sorry jay had a question first, so I don't know sorry, I didn't see any handcuffs. Okay, I was wondering: do we have any information about subsequent infections of either residents or workers at isabella? Have there been any more deaths there? I do not have that information, but I will obtain it and share it. Thank you danielle. I think there might be an issue with the fifth resolution. The fifth licensing resolution from March isidro are you there, which one is specific. It's number five. It says semen, cassandra, group 4020 broadway between 215 and 214 and 215. that place that address is not located between 215 and 214 and 215.. It says 40208 10th avenue between 214th and 215th. I see 20 broadway. Is that wrong? It should be on 10th avenue, it's 40, 28 10th avenue. That's what 97 yeah? That's not what it says here. It says 4020 and I'm looking at the licensing, reso yeah cassandra is definitely on 10th avenue. So perhaps I can do google search and send it over to organism, and that could be a quick change. It appears that there are two different versions of the March items and some versions have it incorrect as 4020a broadway and some versions have it correct as 4020a 10th avenue, everyone should be advised that it's 4020a 10th avenue broadway one is wrong, but thank you for pointing that out and if anybody has the broadway address just know that it's 10th avenue. Thank you. Okay, liz barber has her minute. I hope whoever else was missing her. Who else was missing their minutes. I said the result. Excuse me, since the agenda has it as that we're doing the roll call. Can we please do the roll call now yeah? Let's do the wrong call. That's exactly what we're just asking for okay.

Don't have a policy? You don't have a you're, a community liaison you're, not a you're, not a policy legislative or budget person, so the coib ruling is that there's a distinction between policy, legislative and budget staff versus community staff, so that would not, which is why for steve, it's a conflict and for you it would not be, and she also doesn't work for the people we're addressing it.

Okay, so let me just see if I have this straight you're voting, no on f you're voting, no on number, eight for June and you're voting, yes to the rest, all right and close ugins and just the wheels fall off the wagon there.

I am voting no on March 11. I'm voting, I'm sorry on March, 11 and 14, and I'm voting yes to the rest. Eliezer, sorry liz. If I might, I just want to also note. I just actually realized that the language within f would leave me to have to change the vote as you have yeah. I know, unfortunately, the very the very resolution I try to vote for a thousand times on I'm going to have to now change it so that I am not voting due to conflict. What's the nature of the conflict employer, I see you all know my position on many issues now: who's the employer. Okay, I'm sorry! Francisco! Do you have something related to your vote because your hands up? I just wanted to make a comment about some of the stuff that we are voting on, but not my goal. We're only fine yeah, that's why I was what my raise my hand was raised. So when there's over in this questioning I'll be one of the first, I got you, okay, I'm sorry. Doesn't he need to state his re his employer? For the record, I mean you can read sort of like he works, for course, so just have a person who states that they cannot have a conflict or whatever and lizards daryl is actually correct. He does have to state who he works, for he works for the city council. Well, I've. Actually I've actually switched I'm now in the mayor's office. I see okay and what's the nature of that conflict being employed by the mayor's office. That's a conflict, because why the resolve calls upon the mayor and the city council. Do you have a policy position with the mayor's office or a community position with the mayor's office policy? I mean I'm gonna say the same thing to you that I said to debbie. If your position with the mayor's office is as a community liaison, that's not a conflict. You can vote your conscience on this matter. If your position with the mayor's office is a policy legislative or budget responsibility, then that would be a conflict. I don't know what you do with the mayor's office, but if it's not a policy legislative or budget role, then that's not a conflict and you are free to vote. What exactly is your position? I'm a manager so that that's why I'm saying like this? Would this would typically be a conflict. I would not yeah. I would then so, let's just that is he has a conflict and he should not be voting. I think we should accept that we're moving on here eliezer. How do you vote June, electabot, no in June and yes to the rest? No on June 8, yes to the rest. Okay! Is there anybody whose vote I did not record I've got. I think I got votes for everybody except francisco alvarez and mariam james. They are not on the call we are. I want to change one of my votes. Yes, on June 8, I vote. No, okay, you ready ten o'clock. We don't want to finish at 11 o'clock by no means 3 to 10.. I don't have the exact tally, but I've got at least 27 no or abstaining votes on June 8, so it appears that everything passed except for that one I'll have an official tally tomorrow. But for those of you keeping score, it looks like everything passes, I'm not sure about June 6.. I think that one passed narrowly, but it looks like June 8 is the one that did not pass. Thank you and for the sake of keeping the agenda together, we have. We would love to have three minutes presentations on the remaining three committee chairs that have reports to make steve fay and debbie if you'll be kind enough to eli. I'm sorry francisco has his. He raised his hand. He wanted to say something all right. Thank you for reminding me, okay, how you guys doing just quickly. We were having conversations about washington, heights and inwood and just the discriminatory practices that we have have been having in our community for quite some time when it comes to black folks that come visit the heights and it's not just dominican-owned businesses as well as non-dominican-owned businesses, and I thought that we were gonna talk about that in this meeting, and I just wanted to bring that out and lastly, another point that I always make is we live in Manhattan and there will be noise. We've been locked and cooped in since March. You guys got to give it at least a couple of weeks where people can get some of those frustrations of being cooped up for three months, so there is going to be fireworks. There are going to be parties more than usual, but this is an unusual time that we are living in, and people have to kind of be consistent of that and that's it. Thank you guys all right. Thank you for your point. Francisco always well taken steve. You report. No sorry angel has his hands up. He has his hands up for a new business and we're still on committee. Yeah committed reports. Am I on yes you're on all right. I don't want to get into a public debate, but I would argue that a lot of the noise that's been going on lately has been has been really excessive, especially when it goes on until four or five in the morning. As of today, 878 residents of washington, heights and inwood have lost their lives in the Covid-19 19 crisis. 4831 have tested positive, zip codes, 32 and 40 are tied right now for the highest rate of cases per 100. 000 people zip code 32, has had the highest number of deaths: 267, zip code, 40, 254 deaths, zip code, 33, 194, zip code, 34 163, so we have four percent of the overall deaths in in new york city. I'm trying to arrange a meeting of the committee for July. Our original date was preempted by the new members orientation on July 9th. I'm waiting to hear back from some of my committee members, nation, diaz, sally fisher, jay mazur. Please get back to me, so I know your availability. We would be getting a presentation from columbia, university, medical center on a new mental health, outpatient initiative, as well as a presentation from the william f ryan health center, which is renovating a building and preparing to open up a what promises to be a very good health facility for washington heights at wadsworth avenue or just south of 181st street. The new york state nurses association is coming back to us to talk about the situation with the psych unit at the island pavilion, which has been relocated to gracie square on the upper east side, and we have no word as to when it's going to come back to allen and I'm also expecting to get reports from new york, presbyterian and isabella geriatric center. So please, committee members get back to me, so we can settle on a date for the July meeting. Thank you, steve dave and just send me those statistics, because I didn't catch all of them. I'd appreciate it. Danielle has a question I'm assuming for steve yeah. I have a question for steve. I'm just wondering if the committee considered taking a stance on racism and racism as a public health issue, especially in light of what happened in fort tryon park, as was previously mentioned. This is committee business yep, I'm wondering if they took a stance, I'm just curious. Oh, that was a question. Yes, I don't understand the reference to fort try and park. My question is racism? Is a public health issue and what's happening to black people in the u.s is a public health issue and I'm just wondering if the public, if the health committee considered taking a stance on it as a as a public health, I issue that might be a good topic for our next meeting. I mean it's an awfully broad topic, but I don't think it applies to what happened. We don't know exactly what happened at fort trium park and I think I think what liz suggested earlier is. That is that it may not turn out to be what people think it was. So I don't know that that's relevant to this situation, but this is something we've discussed in our committee. The overall problem with the health disparities- and we will continue to look at it, but we tend to pass resolutions that are specifically targeted to situations and- and I think, on the whole, on the balance, our committee has been dealing with providing arguing and advocating for for making sure that we have appropriate medical care for all of the people who live in washington heights and inward all right. Thank you all right. I appreciate that faith. Okay, yes, thank you, mr chairman. Yes, okay. Yes, I would like to report on our youtube education committee recent panel discussion, as you, as probably many of you already witnessed. We have tons of problems still you know latin in our district and I wanted just to single out fewer than just to you know to make the world of them according to the superintendent. You know, one of the things that I think is morphing song is the expectation of teachers providing instruction virtually is still a challenges, since they have never have done seen this. It hasn't been the case before so many of them are still in the learning, along with many other students. So some of the issue- also, that is still a problem- is that there is not sufficient laptops. Internet service is another problem that they are displacing which, by the way I wanted to thank mr chairman, for following up for, following up on the letter that our committee wrote, you send it to border president and I hope the border president as well. Will you know echo that request, and hopefully we will have a an answer from the chancellor. Some other problems also I wanted also to to think about, is that padding is still in limbo and train of with instructions. You know parties need information with the technology, many parents, even parents. They not really aware how to deal with this. Neither their children know how to deal. You know with this technology on the side of the deputy one of the panelists deputy commissioner, miss williams, one of the things that she provided is that internal they run away and homeless. Youth is that during the coffee, these are departments were very helpful in taking them out of the shelter and putting and putting them in hotels rooms separate. She also found on the issue that she urged the federal government and remain hopeful that they, you know, provide additional funded funding, much needed. You know to alleviate the situation that you know many districts per se, new york city in general, you know is facing. I also wanted to mention that miss battino, that probably many of you know her she's retired from district six. She also mentioned her recent contact that she had with several principals and teachers, and even parents, and she found out that district 6 of the school district had distributed over 4, 500, ipods and, but still you know, still show she also. She also mentioned that the service, the wi-fi service that is being provided in the district, is not really. The service has not been exactly the same compared to other industries like the affluent communities. So this is something that is also you know it's. We should start looking into it, and another thing- and last I wanted to mention- is the materials and supplies that require for to complete assignments among students. You know, unfortunately, they are still struggling at home to get those supplies, so they, in other words, that is a target and supply for a student to be able to complete their assignments. Along with this report, you probably will see the the agenda. Unfortunately, we have to. I have to submit the agenda at 5 30 yesterday, because the agenda was a composition of several of callies from the other committee. As you know, we did this in conjunction or in collaboration with the department of youth, more precisely the neighborhood advisory board, where some of my colleagues like curtis also is sitting there myself, but some of the other folks that were supposed to submit the the the notes for the for that meeting. Unfortunately, they submitted late, but anyway, equally important, they did the job. I want to thank everyone that were involved in making this you know possible and of course I want to thank all the the panelists like again, the our superintendent commissioner williams, miss bartinos. I also want to thank sharon, king from uptown hope at the private syrian hospital. She did an excellent and also, of course, our beloved ivana stan, who always you know, is willing to join us and, of course I don't want to miss the staff. What community board for john may, you know working on the transmission making all this possible and and all of you for even taking time and watching those videos other than that. I thank you all and I wish you everyone to have a healthy and wonderful summer. Thank you all. Thank you, faye for the wonderful written letter that you were able to send and the request to get us to send those letters to mahanbara's president's office. Thank you, debbie. The last report before we go into new business and all business new business and then wrap it up. Thank you eli. I think you've gotten most of my report, so I will not add to that on citibank. Just a reminder: July 6. We are having a meeting because mta needs to come to us and talk about the new elevators, the next elevator project, which would be kicking off at the 190th street. A stop! I'm sorry next meeting when sorry July 6th. So I will, we will be having a summer meeting specifically to hear from the mta about the next phase of the elevator project, which means that again, as of today 181st street and the elevators of the 184th street end of that station are on track to be completed in august. So they need to come to us to talk about September, and I will say I think I know ebenezer provided information on this, but just in terms of the 181 busway. As far as I know, to reiterate that this will be a large community meeting not only with cb12, but all the stakeholders, including elected offices, businesses. You know all the myriad stakeholders are involved in this. I think dot's point of view is that this one is not a is not like the others. It is complicated and it is going to take. You know a sort of public input of all kinds and sort of a yeah, and but we don't- I at least have not heard any timing on it. And again this is ebenezer to just people, understand the chair and ebenezer. You know they were on this immediately. I was on you know, we were talking to them and I think the timing of us being on the short list again. This idea was floated in November and announced, but the idea that we got on the shortlist I think was like oh, it was so sudden and I think it was a surprise to a lot of entities. That's it that's what I got. Oh and good luck. We have so many of our community board members on ballots tonight. Good luck to everybody, guys we're gonna finish our meeting with one last first item. That angel is going to present to us on new items and then we're gonna definitely make sure that you guys have a wonderful rest of the evening angel. If you will before we send us off, have a couple of minutes angel is gone yeah. I also have elected here representatives who have been patiently waiting to give their reports. I mean the ones that just showed up at 9 30. who's there. I don't see anybody. I've been here since 6 30. Oh, I said I'm sorry. I was just looking at the first all right so chris, and who else is there chris? Go ahead? Hey everybody there's a time limit right. So this is what we do now. As we see it's nice to see you all. I won't take much of your time, so all of the things that I would update you on have already been discussed extensively tonight, the repeal of 50a the movement building around that effort, the conversations around defunding NYPD. I think, honestly, the biggest update that I'd provide is that just tonight after the polls closed for obvious reasons, we wanted to wait to announce until, after that point we're going to be doing a food pantry in holyrood church on thursday on thursday, at 12 noon. So please spread the word. People in your buildings who may be in need right now we're giving away substantial boxes of dried goods and fresh produce, and it's something that we hope to start this thursday and continue going forward and the one thing that hasn't been discussed as much today that I would just put on everybody's radar from our work in the senator's office. Right now is sort of wave of evictions that we don't necessarily know how quickly it's coming, but we have a sense that it is coming because the executive order from the governor became swiss cheese effectively on saturday and so filings of new evictions are going to start to pick up and so we're working closely with legal service providers in the district. In order to get as clear of a vision of the way that proof that your income was impacted due to Covid-19 19 is going to be implemented in the courts right because if you can prove that you suffered financial hardship because of providing 19, then theoretically, you're safe from new eviction proceedings for non-payment era knows this well from her work. I'm sure this is this is all being figured out right now, and so we are committed to working with Manhattan legal services to offer a symposium on what we know. That'll probably be the week of June 13th and we'll reach out to the relevant committees at cb12. If there's interest in co-sponsoring, but just know that we are definitely very worried. We have our ears and we have our ears to the ground and our eyes out for the ways that we need to be protecting our community right now from the risk of eviction. That's opened up recently. Thank you, chris. Thank you, hi everyone, I'm also here yeah and by June 13th. I assume you meant July 13th, I'm so sorry. Thank you! Liz, July, 13th, it's very late. I just want to say thank you, chris I'm going to be reaching out myself as that's personal, that's going to be a lot of me yeah! Thank you always for your patience and humility. I really appreciate that. Sorry, marianne hi, everyone, sorry I had to dip out for a little bit. I was also here at 6, 30. and dipped off for a bit. It came back at around nine something, but I just wanted to say one. Thank you so much for you all being here. This is one of the community boards that I cover. I covered quite a few that folks are still on and engaged over the summer, and I think it's very important, like I think his name victor, has said to discuss race relations as especially because it is pertinent to this community what I would like to say as well that the controller has a Covid-19 resource guide, that we continue to add information on that's in several different languages, including spanish, bangla and urdu, which I know our languages that are spoken around. The city also wanted to mention that we are continuing to have weekly workshops for small businesses. So if folks would like me to share that, I can do so as I always do with ebenezer, and I also wanted to say that we had a tenants rights forum or a few of them in which people got to ask questions to a legal aid attorney this summer. We're planning a few of virtual events as well as a pride event and I'll get back to you with the details, but also too, we are going to have a few meetings regarding to a specific community. So if anyone out that's on the community board call deals with immigrant communities in different ways, I know most of you all do but feel free to give me a call or send me an email and again I can for sure ensure that ebenezer sends my information down and we also have a few reports. One report is pertaining to issues that we've had that we've had as a city regarding Covid-19, so the comptroller has asked for documents regarding kovis as the beginning of the shutdown which was around like March 22nd or so so we haven't gotten much information from the city and again as his role as comptroller is to ensure that we're as efficient with our resources as possible. So I will get back to you when we have follow up on that and also too we're looking into the lack of resources that senior facilities face, especially when it comes to advocates for the seniors themselves, and I will share that report with the agent committee as I'm very fond of all of the members on that committee in this board. But I would like to say thank you so much all for having me here for being patient as well as listening to my report, and I will be in some committee meetings over the summer, but we'll definitely see you all, hopefully in person in the fall. Thank you marielle. We love you we'd love to have you here and we missed you here. Do we have anyone else, any other elected officials that wants to come on rory's here there you go: oh lauren, oh lauren, hi, lauren, hi eliaser nice to meet you. Everyone just want to share with all of you that these past three months, where each of us who are the congress congressional staff, have been isolated from each other, responding remotely as best we can to the profound needs of our constituents. Ironically, has been some of the most profound productive time that we've had in quick succession. The congressman responded to the needs of constituents through several sweeping bills, joining forces with gail brewer and mark levine. He won the inclusion of a provision in the houses in the house's major transportation infrastructure that will require the creation of a community outreach committee at amtrak. This will help to ensure that we will no longer be faced with the situation that we were with amtrak, putting billboards and obscuring people's views, and possibly worth he recognized that amtrak has no is not bound by city planning, ordinances, land, use, etc and he's moving to change that he scored multiple wins with this critical huge transportation bill. Despite being the only member of the new york delegation who is on transportation and infrastructure, so in the works are a the invest act which will provide 30 billion dollars to upgrade hospitals, strengthen public health infrastructure, modernize roadways and hopefully the postal. The postal service, which we do get a great number of calls about, there's also proposed monies for energy infrastructure. I want to share with you his a bit of his response, however, to something you know that you've all been speaking of this evening. I found it- you know in terms of systemic racism and community relations, the police etc. I just want to share this quote with you. This is from a telegram that martin luther king sent to cesar chavez. Some of you I may be dating myself by knowing who chavez was. He was the legendary food worker organizer. Our separate struggles are really one: a struggle for freedom, for dignity and for humanity. You and your fellow workers have demonstrated your commitment to writing. Grievous wrongs forced upon exploited people. We are together with you in spirit and in determination that our dreams for a better tomorrow will be realized, and the congressman used that as a jumping off point to talk about how latino and african american leaders are united across the country to denounce hate and profiling, and that happen, even if and all too frequently, in his congressional district in harlem Bronx washington heights, but we are stronger together and must continue to stand in solidarity to unite our communities against hate and division. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'd like to after three and a half hours of a lot of information and a lot of discussions and and getting a lot of work done to wrap up our meeting. I know angel has been waiting for almost two hours to say a few awards so that we can finally make sure that finally completed okay I'll keep it very quick and succinct. I want to flag this in particular for both parks and public safety, so I I'm sure that you all have seen the the mopeds that you can rent out on the streets. I think they're, wonderful, I like them. It's a different form of transportation. However, a concern of mine is that folks are using them in the park trails and they're mo they're using these motorized vehicles, where pedestrians are walking and they're also running in particular. So I live right by hybrids park. There's a beautiful trail that leads across high bridge into the Bronx folks are riding those motorized vehicles down that the trail that's there and across the bridge into the Bronx, and there also there's also that sidewalk right next to harlem river drive down by the water. Where the same thing is happening, so I just want to flag that so that we can open up a conversation not now, but during a during the next committee meeting for either parks or public safety, because I do think that something needs to be addressed in that regard. I don't I mean thank you. That is one of the things that we spoke about briefly and we will be addressing again just want to make a very important announcement to everybody on this, and thank you for reminding me if you see anything hinky going on with these go rebels, I urge you to take a picture or a short video, make sure that your geocaching your so that your location and timestamp features are on email. It to support. Go revel.com, send it to the company when the company sees that their vehicles are being used in violation of new york city law that it's being used in a park that is being used on a sidewalk that it's being used to go the wrong way down a one-way street. Whatever it's I mean sure, it's an enforcement issue, but if go revel has information on the improper use of their vehicles. They have the ability it's a web-based payment system. They can just disable that user's ability to rent a bike from a scooter from go revel again. It's totally an enforcement issue. We've got other things that we can talk about as well in committee, but I do believe that that's going to be a very effective reporting strategy. Thank you liz. Thank you perfect. Thank you, guys, angel. I saw myself on high bridge on friday. Yes, thank you. I'd like to give a special thanks to nancy preston and all of you guys who constantly send those emails as to how to improve our operation and how do we conduct our businesses, so you guys only make us much better. So having said that, enjoy your summer and be safe and have a great night each and every one of you guys, okay I'll, just briefly make an announcement. If I don't hi- and I just very briefly- is you know that I want to they distribute distribution of you made it yourself? Can you own your yourself? Oh, I will continue distributing the food from my building. Thank you, liz for coming to help me on wednesday at 1 p.m. You know anybody that needs food. Please let me know you know how to get me.
