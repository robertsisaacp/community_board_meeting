I'm extremely humbled and happy to share this platform with so many well- intentioned people who really and truly care about their community people who are willing and able to give up their time and effort and energy to make sure that we that we coming to a civil understanding as to how to bring city agencies the police department to come and sit down and discuss some of the issues that are affecting us directly and again.

I want to also acknowledge that we're joined by Jeremy Crim from the first Deputy mayor's office and Isaiah jenkins, the Manhattan borough director of the mayor's Community Affairs, unit, and I, want to thank Isaiah for helping the line up.
Andrea Good afternoon I got a little bit of an understanding that it might be about some noise complaints, but I'm just going to go over the status and the state of the 3- 4 Currently, a 3- 4 precinct, focusing on major crimes and violent crimes.
As far as shootings were down for the year four compared to five last year, so we were doing really good this year compared to last year again thanks to community thanks to the NCOS and our sectors and precinct people working together.
That was not allowed to be open, and now is our office fields, complaints and coordinates with a number of different agencies, acrosss the city to get out and look at the conditions on the ground and make sure that as businesses reopen they're doing it in a way that's safe for both the community, the customers, the workers and the business itself.
The main thing that we did was set up a 311 complaint, line, and so residents of this community board should know that you can go to the 311 website or you can call 311 and make complaints about businesses that are opening, but not in compliance with guidelines.
The setup is what's happening on the what's happening, with passage on the sidewalk and there's a complaint page for that on 3- 1, 1- 1, as well, under open restaurants, and both of those complaint pages have references to each other, and so you know you can should be able to easily navigate to the right place or the call taker We have people from all different agencies- Department of Health, Department of buildings, fire, Deputy Sheriff's office and Department of Sanitation Department, environmental protection.
If anybody in the city government knows the noise code in and out She's been with DEP for quite a while a couple of decades, at least well more than that, so I'm so happy that you're still with DEP, and we can count on you to help us understand.
So I have been with cep for 35 years now, but we'll put that aside for the moment and let's talk about noise, the noise code and some of the issues that we're seeing, especially with so many people having to stay home and probably an increased sensitivity to normal.
Think because so many people are within their dwelling units that the ice cream truck guys play so that people know that they're outside and maybe come out, It's a difficult time for them, because they've lost a lot of street business.
We probably should make clear that that maybe most of the complaints that people have had in the community lately involving the late night parties and fireworks and cars racing up and down the streets, those probably do not go to you.
But it's helpful to understand what it is that the EPA does do And I have to mention that I work for the parks, Department, and so does this gentleman Deputy inspector benny mccants, the director of city- wide operations for the Parks enforcement patrol He's very familiar with the Washington Heights Inwood area.
Our next speaker is emily Goldman, the deputy director for beta NYC She has been analyzing and cataloging the three one complaints generated from our community and just yesterday she works in association with the borough president's office, and just yesterday the borough president's office released a report showing the various statistics broken down by community board, and there are like five different categories of noise: complaints.
Complaints broken down in like in numerous different ways that are actually specially tailored for community board purposes.
Think also, like EDC, has a couple of categories of noise: complaints that go to them, but the majority of them go to the New York Police Department, but there are really are like almost a dozen different types of noise: complaints, noise, commercial Noise, Residential, Noise, Street, Sidewalk, just building construction, noise, noise at places of worship, helicopter noise and then within each of those categories.
There were at least five noise categories that must have been, maybe in that top 10 tier of complaints generated by people here in board, 12 He just plugged this into boardstat and basically for the year 2020 for specifically for community board 12.
That probably accounts for why that complaint type is the sixth highest in community Ward 12 over this past year of 2020, followed by illegal parking, unsanitary, conditions, water issues and then finally, is is noise, commercial, And, I.
Think the interesting thing to notice about that is that noise, commercial is often one of the highest complaint types of the fact that it's substantially less than Noise Street Sidewalk, Noise residential noise, vehicle non- emergency police matter and illegal fireworks even is clearly representing the fact that commercial businesses have been mostly shut.
So, there's not going to be the same amount of noise generated from commercial establishments as we would expect in a non- So that that's just a quick sample of the top complaint types in Community board.
We could cut this data, but that's kind of the most the most overview way we have of looking at it, and I said- If I'm not mistaken, the number of street and the Noise Street Sidewalk complaint, category.
Dr, Arlene bronzaft, a board member for grow NYC used to be known as the council on the environment She probably launched her career in Inwood, working on behalf of the students at Ps98, in a groundbreaking study where she found that the students who had classrooms on the side of the building closest to the elevated subway tracks were suffering because their lessons were continually disrupted by the noise from the subway and the people on the other.
And, they said they would ameliorate the noise at schools, similarly located near tracks, but people also live near the tracks, and so the Ta agreed to start quieting.
The tracks with the procedures that were developed in Inwood This is 2020 and the Covid-19 situation has added another element, but I strongly believe that what we're talking about particularly 18,000 complaints about sidewalk, noise, but I, think if the people got together as they did, then they would be able to come up with a solution.
When we talk about noise and we know that people need their sleep, their rest.
I. Think the people in the community now the police, department, Dp and all the members of the board can very well do what we did all those years.
I understand the stress of coed Covid-19, but I think that we can, if we work together, come up with solutions that will reduce the level of sound in the community and improve the health and the quality of life.
All right looks like we have a lot of people in in the chat who want to be able to speak.
First, you know Kenneth was the first one We need to think about how we're going to hold each other accountable for addressing these issues, because I can say that I have been reaching out to people elected everybody about this issue, begging for help, and I.
Would like to know what is how we're going to address it, and I would propose that we think about starting a task force, and that would help us to move forward to address this.
Then it just goes away, but that we actually have a mechanism in place in order to like make sure that we are addressing these specific issues and in really targeting solutions for different issues and that task force, you know, can be made up of other people a lot of people here, as well as of the community members, who are directly impacted by it.
At, And I just thought that everybody here, if this is what the community had to endure , know I've been fighting as a community board member for years about this, issue.
All in be all on having the Community board deal with this issue, and I expect the committee that I chair, which you're a member of, will continue to look into this and act on this issue.
So I like to know what are we going to do from this moment on to get this fixed as a community We're ready to work, and I hope?
You know, but what I would say: is, let's think, outside of the box, and let's start thinking of ways of being able to redefine public safety where disproportionately people of color are not going to be impacted, because some people do not understand intersectionality.
, the next one is wendy life wendy you wanna, do live all right, go ahead, hello, I'm speaking for the residents of chittenden avenue, which is for the 34th precinct, and we have had problems even before the Covid-19 of people parking on our street and hanging out and become unbearable and unlivable.
We are desperately in need of street parking, so change the sign on the West side of Chittenden Avenue to let the residents legally park and that way we would get rid of the problem of people coming hanging.
We did an intel report on it, And we're waiting to hear a response, but it also needs a little push from other people in the community right, not just the police department.
We must also understand that when we go to our local restaurants and bars to spend our local money we're helping small businesses, if you see a problem, address it right, So I'm willing to work out with people that want to form a task.
Definitely a splash of you know: segregation when it comes to real estate and things like that Do you have any examples of cities that are doing it correctly through either zoning Okay, I'd like to talk to the crime issue, because I have written papers on crime and noise and you're.
Let's get creative there's a ton of do- gooders in our city that have plenty of money that they come in here and create programs to give people opportunities, because the reason why this is happening is People are unemployed, they do not have jobs, they do not have places to go and they do not have other things to do, and It's not going to be ameliorated by just looking at the micro level of this particular spot, or this particular restaurant, or that particular like corner.
If you know the data you'll understand that those are the community boards that have the largest concentration of minorities and with that I'll again encourage you guys to come and assist and participate and take advantage of this.
I've lived here, like I said, a long time and what I think one of the causes are as to why people flock to this part of the city to do whatever they want to do is also linked with a permissiveness see the businesses in our area that serve alcohol and that had a club- Like atmosphere have repeatedly broken their licensing agreements over time, and that also includes the issue with La Marina and La. Marina was closed down, but the perception of our neighborhood did not change with that, and so, whereas absolutely everything is exacerbated by Covid-19.
I, do not think I'm going to work safe, And, then there's the broader picture of how our neighborhood is so dismissed by the people that behave.
We feel fundamentally let down by our elected by the police and by the Community Board And I'm, one of those people that believes wholeheartedly.
As we move towards reopening schools, I, can only imagine how this noise pollution, how the parties, how the intensive group gatherings that I've seen all over my neighborhood are going to affect my students and I'm speaking in a very passionately way, because my kids are being affected like they literally can not sleep.
If I remember, I think, Steve Simon last week at the Committee of the whole, I'm, not sure if he had said that out of all the coded deaths in New, York City, there was something like 900 and somewhat people in this area that died of Covid-19, and you know.
Okay, I live acrosss the street from Morgan Stanley children's hospital and three blocks from my house: Okay, the emergency room and the pardon the hospital and every single night, and sometimes, during the day, I'm hearing people blasting their car stereos that my windows are actually shaking You know: is: is not there.
So I think that's really important that you kind of build a relationship with the police department and the community affairs officer, the NCOS.
We want that Kiosk shut down and if you guys are not going to do it, the community will do it because we're not getting any help from anybody in this community, and I feel sorry for so many people who have complained tonight because their problems are not resolved.
Cb12 has 15 times the noise complaints of some other community boards.
We've worked with our precincts here in the Bronx Us, deter the noise by actually patrolling the streets, making sure they're, giving summons and taking speakers away, and I know recently.
We're getting people out in the street that want to challenge officers and try to get them on videotape, taking a proactive approach to things where they may have to end up, locking a person up, and so the officers have to be very careful on how they approach every situation, because we want to continue to foster a good relationship with the community by still addressing the noise complaints and the quality of life.
I, say to you that my office has directly been involved with many of the constituents trying to address the issues even going back to before July 4th when all of the fireworks have gone off and the Deputy inspector held a meeting at the Y talking about the issues of concerns and my staff were attending the 33rd and other community precinct.
I think that we need to look at what we can do collectively to communicate with our neighbors, how to be respectful of other people's rights regarding a quality of life issues that impact them.
Look forward to working with everybody to engage everyone, including the young people, are the folks that are making the noise.
We're going to have to engage people educate, them, build some level of consciousness to care for your neighbor and to be really cognizant of the kind of noise you're generating that impacts on others.
I, go to a lot with community boards, as you know, and I really want to congratulate you- The chair, the chair of the health committee and all the members who spoke, how you treated the wonderful way in which you treated the public and how everybody got to speak.
Think many of you know on 163Rd street, where we've had a lot of challenges with noise.
