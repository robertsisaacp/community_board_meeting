I'm extremely humbled and happy to share this platform with so many well-intentioned people who really and truly care about their community people who are willing and able to give up their time and effort and energy to make sure that we that we coming to a civil understanding as to how to bring city agencies the police department to come and sit down and discuss.
The executive director of the mayor's office of special enforcement, geraldine kelpin, the director for air noise policy and enforcement for the department of environmental protection, deputy inspector benny mccants, the director of city-wide operations for the parks enforcement, patrol, emily goldman, the deputy director of beta NYC and last, but certainly not least, dr arlene bronzaft, a long-time board member of grow, NYC, formerly known as the council on the environment and recognized for years.
I want to also acknowledge that we're joined by jeremy crim from the first deputy mayor's office and isaiah jenkins, the Manhattan borough director of the mayor's community affairs, unit, and I, want to thank isaiah for helping the line up.
I got a little bit of an understanding that it might be about some noise complaints, but I'm just going to go over the status and the state of In the 3-4 currently overall crime in for the year-to-date in three poor priests and is down about eight percent 653 versus 7-eleven.
Only were we assigned to deal with reopening around restaurants and bars, but in phased reopening in general, including all kinds of retail, any basically any place that wasn't allowed to be open, and now is our office fields, complaints and coordinates with a number of different agencies across the city to get out and look at the conditions on the ground and make sure that as businesses reopen they're doing it in a way that's safe for both the community, the customers, the workers and the business itself.
The main thing that we did was set up a 311 complaint, line, and so residents of this community board should know that you can go to the 311 website or you can call 311 and make complaints about businesses that are opening, but not in compliance with guidelines.
So I have been with cep for 35 years now, but we'll put that aside for the moment and let's talk about noise, the noise code and some of the issues that we're seeing, especially with so many people having to stay home and probably an increased sensitivity to normal.
Think because so many people are within their dwelling units that the ice cream truck guys play so that people know that they're outside and maybe come out, It's a difficult time for them, because they've lost a lot of street business.
We probably should make clear that that maybe most of the complaints that people have had in the community lately involving the late night parties and fireworks and cars racing up and down the streets- So, they probably they go to the police.
She has been analyzing and cataloging the three one complaints generated from our community and, just yesterday she works in association with the borough president's office, and just yesterday the borough president's office released a report showing the various statistics broken down by community board, and there are like five different categories of noise.
Complaints broken down in like in numerous different ways that are actually specially tailored for community board.
Other thing to keep in mind is that the new york city, open data platform itself right now and the 311 data specifically is experiencing some lags, and that is due to like the unprecedented volume of three-on-one complaints coming through relating to the kovid situation and also the fact that that 3-1-1 workers are working remotely.
Think also, like EDC, has a couple of categories of noise: complaints that go to them, but the majority of them go to the new york police department.
But there are really are like almost a dozen different types of noise: complaints, noise, commercial noise, residential noise street sidewalk, just building construction, noise, noise at places of worship, helicopter noise and then within each of those categories, there's subcategories Depending on what exactly you want to look at, you want to be aware of those distinctions so that you can get your get your data in the most sort of relevant way to what you yourself are looking at, and mainly today.
There were at least five noise categories that must have been, maybe in that top 10 tier of complaints generated by people here in board, 12 He just plugged this into boardstat and basically for the year 2020 for specifically for community board 12.
That probably accounts for why that complaint type is the sixth highest in community ward 12 over this past year of 2020, followed by illegal parking, unsanitary, conditions, water issues and then finally, is is noise, commercial, And, I.
Think the interesting thing to notice about that is that noise, commercial is often one of the highest complaint types of the fact that it's substantially less than noise street sidewalk noise, residential noise, vehicle non-emergency police matter and illegal fireworks.
We could cut this data, but that's kind of the most the most overview way we have of looking at it, and I said- If I'm, not mistaken, the number of street and the noise street sidewalk complaint, category.
She, she probably launched her career in inwood, working on behalf of the students at ps98, in a groundbreaking study where she found that the students who had classrooms on the side of the building closest to the elevated subway tracks were suffering because their lessons were continually disrupted by the noise from the subway and the people on the other.
I worked with the ta and they said they would ameliorate the noise at schools, similarly located near tracks, but people also live near the tracks, and so the ta agreed to start quieting the tracks with the procedures that were developed in inwood, we came up with solutions.
This is 2020 and the covert situation has added another element, but I strongly believe that what we're talking about particularly 18 000 complaints, about sidewalk, noise, but I, think if the people got together as they did, then they would be able to come up with a solution.
When we talk about noise and we know that people need their sleep, their rest.
I. Think the people in the community now the police, department, dp and all the members of the board can very well do what we did all those years.
I understand the stress of coed Covid-19, but I think that we can, if we work together, come up with solutions that will reduce the level of sound in the community and improve the health and the quality of life.
May All right looks like we have a lot of people in in the chat who want to be able to speak.
We need to think about how we're going to hold each other accountable for addressing these issues, because I can say that I have been reaching out to people elected everybody about this issue.
Then it just goes away, but that we actually have a mechanism in place in order to like make sure that we are addressing these specific issues and in really targeting solutions for different issues and that task force, you know, can be made up of other people a lot of people here, as well as of the community members, who are directly impacted by it.
All in be all on having the community board deal with this issue, and I expect the committee that I chair, which you're a member of, will continue to look into this and act on this issue.
So I like to know what are we going to do from this moment on to get this fixed as a community The 30, the 34 present community board 12 is ready to work.
You know, but what I would say: is, let's think, outside of the box, and let's start thinking of ways of being able to redefine public safety where disproportionately people of color are not going to be impacted, because some people don't understand intersectionality.
I'm speaking for the residents of chittenden avenue, which is for the 34th precinct, and we have had problems even before the Covid-19 of people parking on our street and hanging out and become unbearable and unlivable.
We are desperately in need of street parking, so change the sign on the west side of chittenden avenue to let the residents legally park and that way we would get rid of the problem of people coming hanging.
We must also understand that when we go to our local restaurants and bars to spend our local money we're helping small businesses, if you see a problem, address it right , I'm willing to work out with people that want to form a task, force, and I think it's really a cool idea to do that, but really grateful for the work that NYPD is doing all along.
Let's get creative, there's a ton of do-gooders in our city that have plenty of money that they come in here and create programs to give people opportunities, because the reason why this is happening is Because, people are unemployed , they don't have jobs, they don't have places to go and they don't have other things to do, and It's not going to be ameliorated by just looking at the micro level of this particular spot, or this particular restaurant, or that particular like corner.
If you know the data you'll understand that those are the community boards that have the largest concentration of minorities And I do want a second to acknowledge those here who also related to the parks.
Taken me all of this meeting to calm down, because this is a psychological issue, as the doctors rightly said, and it is a form of violence perpetuated on the residents of this neighborhood with the level of noise and what happens.
I've lived here, like I said, a long time and what I think one of the causes are as to why people flock to this part of the city to do whatever they want to do is also linked with a permissiveness see the businesses in our area that serve alcohol and that had a club-like atmosphere have repeatedly broken their licensing agreements over time, and that also includes the issue with la marina and la marina was closed.
They, don't want to be on this call because they don't see the point we feel fundamentally let down by our elected by the police and by the community board And I'm, one of those people that believes wholeheartedly in divesting funds from the police into community resources and groups.
I can only imagine how this noise pollution, how the parties, how the intensive group gatherings that I've seen all over my neighborhood are going to affect my students and I'm speaking in a very passionately way, because my kids are being affected like they literally cannot.
If I, remember I think, steve simon last week at the committee of the whole, I'm, not sure if he had said that out of all the coded deaths in new york city, there was something like 900 and somewhat people in this area that died of Covid-19, and you know.
, so I think that's really important that you kind of build a relationship with the police department and the community affairs officer, the ncos.
So just call just call us and we will send a sector car or the nc all over okay, So who's, whose responsibility is it to enforce when they're, seeing large groups of people like partying now and everything else whose responsibility is that?
Cb12 has 15 times the noise complaints of some other community.
We've worked with our precincts here in the Bronx Us, deter the noise by actually patrolling the streets, making sure they're, giving summons and taking speakers away, and I know recently.
We're getting people out in the street that want to challenge officers and try to get them on videotape, taking a proactive approach to things where they may have to end up, locking a person up, and so the officers have to be very careful on how they approach every situation, because we want to continue to foster a good relationship with the community by still addressing the noise complaints and the quality of life.
I need those units really keeping an eye on the crowd, control issues on 9th avenue, 207 by the speedway george washington, high school or trying park inwood hill park, or you know, by indian road up there Trust me when I tell we're moving in the right direction and the cops here care about this community.
I say to you that my office has directly been involved with many of the constituents trying to address the issues even going back to before July 4th when all of the fireworks have gone off and the deputy inspector held a meeting at the y talking about the issues of concerns and my staff were attending the 33rd and other community precinct.
I think that we need to look at what we can do collectively to communicate with our neighbors, how to be respectful of other people's rights regarding a quality of life.
It continues to be an issue in many in many areas, not just noise, but also the streets are very dirty.
Look forward to working with everybody to engage everyone, including the young people, are the folks that are making the noise.
I, don't think we're going to be able to arrest ourselves out of this issue, we're going to have to engage people educate, them, build some level of consciousness to care for your neighbor and to be really cognizant of the kind of noise you're generating that impacts on others.
I, go to a lot with community boards, as you know, and I really want to congratulate you- The chair, the chair of the health committee and all the members who spoke, how you treated the wonderful way in which you treated the public and how everybody got to speak.
Think many of you know on 163rd street, where we've had a lot of challenges with noise.
