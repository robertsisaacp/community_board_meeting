on there's no power here, built in so hey steven, snowballs I'll, be taking minutes report tonight and I can go through the zoom panelist list to try to pick out people Yes I, don't understand that when people raise their hand, support, oh, that might be a bit tougher from taking notes, I'm extremely humbled and happy to share this platform with so many well-intentioned people who really and truly care about their community people who are willing and able to give up their time and effort and energy to make sure that we that we coming to a civil understanding as to how to bring city agencies the police department to come and sit down and discuss.
Manhattan north of the NYPD The executive director of the mayor's office of special enforcement geraldine kelpin, the director for air noise policy and enforcement for the department of environmental protection, deputy inspector benny mccants, the director of city-wide operations for the parks enforcement patrol, emily goldman, the deputy director of beta NYC and last, but certainly not least, dr arlene bronzaft, a long-time board member of grow.
As far as traffic conditions You know, we did have a slow in productivity and enforcement during the covered months, but now that we're a little bit back somewhat back to normal Now that we're on the stages of opening up businesses, the officers are out there enforcing traffic conditions as best they can Follow up inspector andreas lead with the crime we're down for robberies this 28 day period, I think the ncos are doing a great job with that Most majority of our robberies are delivery, people, So, I, know, I, came from housing and when I used to patrol the housing, and I see a delivery guy.
But large crowds are gathering outside and we have a sense that that's ongoing in this community board and I did mean to say there is also a complaint page for noise for street and sidewalk and those are handled by the police department.
We probably should make clear that that maybe most of the complaints that people have had in the community lately involving the late night parties and fireworks and cars racing up and down the streets- So, they probably they go to the police department.
Inwood area He previously served as the captain in charge of all of the Manhattan pep officers, and then they promoted him to this job and she has been analyzing and cataloging the three one complaints generated from our community and just yesterday she works in association with the borough president's office, and just yesterday the borough president's office released a report showing the various statistics broken down by community board and there are like five different categories of noise complaints , We work in partnership with the Manhattan borough president's office, and we do a lot when it comes to analyzing.
So we've created this tool called boardstat, which some of you may know about It's a dashboard that updates daily, with the full set of three on one data, that's available on the new york city, open data platform and it's broken down by community boards You can very easily in just a couple of clicks, get to a tool in your in your browser that you can explore on your own to look at the three one complaints broken down in like in numerous different ways that are actually specially tailored for community board purposes.
It, usually there's a one day lag before the data populates into boardstat Other thing to keep in mind is that the new york city, open data platform itself right now and the 311 data specifically is experiencing some lags, and that is due to like the unprecedented volume of three-on-one complaints coming through relating to the kovid situation and also the fact that that 3-1-1 workers are working remotely.
We could cut this data, but that's kind of the most the most overview way we have of looking at it and if I'm not mistaken, the number of street and the noise street sidewalk complaint category I think that may be the highest number for any district in Manhattan and she she probably launched her career in inwood, working on behalf of the students at ps98, in a groundbreaking study where she found that the students who had classrooms on the side of the building closest to the elevated subway tracks were suffering because their lessons were continually disrupted by the noise from the subway and the people on the other.
Just, as this community is meeting tonight, one of the mothers of a child at that school was a student of mine at lehman college Other wonderful person was the principal mark, shapiro of ps98 that provided me with all the reading scores and all the data I have to complement the department of environmental protection because they came in and did all the measurements of the sound levels in those classrooms, and so I had the cooperation of dp board of education, Parents and I was able to conduct a study, and the findings were quite remarkable, though my eight-year-old child at that time couldn't understand why a mother had to do a study when it seemed so obvious that children's learning would be impeded by passing trains That's important for this community The board of education agreed to put acoustical ceilings in the classroom, and the transit authority came up with a method to quiet the tracks adjacent to the school Now you're going to ask: How did these two agencies respond?
With the procedures that were developed in inwood, we came up with solutions, This is 2020 and the covert situation has added another element, but I strongly believe that what we're talking about particularly 18 000 complaints, about sidewalk noise but I, think if the people got together as they did, then they would be able to come up with a solution.
I think the people in the community now the police, department, dp and all the members of the board can very well do what we did all those years ago.
All right looks like we have a lot of people in in the chat who want to be able to speak First I'm, sorry that I, just my battery lost the power outage where I live I, said jonathan, who what was the second name tanya tanya's First, you know kenneth was the first one Second one was make m Is a member of community board 12 Next.
We need to think about how we're going to hold each other accountable for addressing these issues, because I can say that I have been reaching out to people elected everybody about this issue, begging for help and I would propose that we think about starting a task force, and that would help us to move forward to address this, and then it just goes away, but that we actually have a mechanism in place in order to like make sure that we are addressing these specific issues and in really targeting solutions for different issues and that task force, you know, can be made up of other people a lot of people here, as well as of the community members, who are directly impacted by it , It's unfortunate that we could not hear that video, because the point of it was to hear it and to hear what we have endured in our communities.
I have met with people at the 33rd all the way up to lieutenants and about this issue, and I got no solutions, no response, and it's just unfortunate All in be all on having the community board deal with this issue and I expect the committee that I chair, which you're a member of, will continue to look into this and act on this issue.
The next one is wendy life wendy, you wanna, do live all right, I'm speaking for the residents of chittenden avenue, which is for the 34th precinct, and we have had problems even before the covet of people parking on our street and hanging out and become unbearable and unlivable We've been working with officer brian poster, who was our neighborhood precinct contact person no help at all and what's been happening, Is that now people have come, they take their chairs.
We did an intel report on it and we're waiting to hear a response, but it also needs a little push from other people in the community right, not just the police department, so any help along anybody in this forum If, we had parking here that residents would have more parking and it wouldn't be an area where people could set up chairs and hopefully help with this with the situation over there.
We must also understand that when we go to our local restaurants and bars to spend our local money we're helping small businesses, if you see a problem address , I'm willing to work out with people that want to form a task force and Aisha is also a member of the community board good evening Everyone.
Responsibility in that conversation as well giving light to the intersectionality I want to be honest and say that growing up, I've known some of those guys that may be motorcyclists driving their cars around some of it Quite frankly, them from boredom stems from lack of access to what I now know as I've gotten older is maybe if there were different types of programs, if our institutions that are in the community gave more access to those youth in the community to kinds of activity Looking at the people in my community, some who are just like I want my child to celebrate the stupid I'm, actually in the 33rd precinct and last saturday night, there was a party along until four o'clock in the morning when, finally, after I would say, 20 calls to the switchboard at the 33rd and 311 complaints.
The mix of socioeconomic systems with you know definitely a splash of you know segregation when it comes to real estate and things like that, That being said: do you have any examples of cities that are doing it correctly through either zoning okay, I'd like to talk to the crime issue, because I have written papers on crime and noise and you're The last speaker was correct because if people are drinking and people are carrying on and then they walk out into the streets that crime could follow, so I would suggest that I'll forward, the paper I think I may have to several people.
I've lived here like I, said a long time and what I think one of the causes are as to why people flock to this part of the city to do whatever they want to do is also linked with a permissiveness see the businesses in our area that serve alcohol and that had a club-like atmosphere have repeatedly broken their licensing agreements over time, and that also includes the issue with la marina and la marina was closed down Covid-19 If. This is something that's been going on for quite a few years and Covid-19 made it worse and yes for people like me, who've been unemployed for four and a half months, there's very little that I feel that I'm left able to take psychologically, but also to the frontline workers that are my neighbors and then there's the broader picture of how our neighborhood is so dismissed by the people that behave Then they leave and they leave all of this garbage everywhere- that we now have to get together as a community, and we see on facebook every saturday morning come and help clean up and part of me feels like why?
This is a beautiful neighborhood with a very broad history, a complex history, a unique history to the to the island of Manhattan, never mind new york itself, and it has been given space to show up as like this I am a solutions orientated person, I've spoken to senator jackson, about coming together and reaching out to the community, and I've mentioned it in passing to our assembly, member de la rosa and I'm speaking on behalf of a lot of people that live in this neighborhood who have just thrown the towel in They.
I am all for that and considering a new way of developing law order, enforcement and community spirit We keep us safe, but right now we are looking at a group of people here who are up for election We share our results and most of us haven't had a reply to an email, a phone call, a facebook, a tweet and the only person I've seen out in Manhattan to be quite frank, is madame burr, a president dealing with things on all levels and to the point where I almost went and I have a personal contact or I pretend I have a baby at home.
, so I think that's really important that you kind of build a relationship with the police department and the community affairs officer, the ncos, and we will send a sector car over and respond.
Every situation is a concern, we're getting people out in the street that want to challenge officers and try to get them on videotape, taking a proactive approach to things where they may have to end up, locking a person up, and so the officers have to be very careful on how they approach every situation, because we want to continue to foster a good relationship with the community by still addressing the noise complaints and the quality of life conditions.
I need those units really keeping an eye on the crowd, control issues on 9th avenue 207 by the speedway george washington, high school or trying park inwood hill park, or you know, by indian road up there Trust me when I tell we're moving in the right direction and the cops here care about this community So many of my neighbors in the past, while so to introduce myself on may 17th : I founded a facebook group called washington heights and inwood for respectful decibel levels due to a very loud car playing music outside , couldn't hear I'm a music teacher Aren't they just left open until a problem?
You know community board meetings with public safety, transportation committee Definitely, look at the community board schedule when we're back in session Yes, you have our commitment to take a serious approach as to the kind of issues that are affecting each and every one of us business, community residents, Some of us, some of the people that are being affected may not have, like you said in the beginning that don't feel comfortable enough to present and articulate their thoughts in english, but they have also a saying into this.
I think that we need to look at what we can do collectively to communicate with our neighbors, how to be respectful of other people's rights regarding a quality of life issues that impact them Obviously.
I go to a lot with community boards, as you know, and I really want to congratulate you- the chair, the chair of the health committee and all the members who spoke how you treated the wonderful way in which you treated the public and how everybody got to speak.
This is something being done successfully in other parts of the country, not in new york city, but it's an important way to ensure that limited spaces in our community are not taken up by folks coming from elsewhere and I think it might have a secondary benefit of helping to alleviate some of the problems that are described here, and you know in the context in which we're all extremely sensitive to the need to avoid any kind of overly aggressive enforcement, particularly on young people of color A focus on vehicles is something different.
