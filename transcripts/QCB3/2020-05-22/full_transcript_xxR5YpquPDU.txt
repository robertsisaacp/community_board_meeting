You can speak for about a minute or soaps and okay. Thank you. All I wanted to address the board to. Please ask your help to prevent something: I'm calling driver discrimination being meaning biased against my in our community on our local streets and I like biking and I use public transportation, I'm not talking about something one-sided, but misery recently helped me with the traffic complaint and the response from the DoD officials, their analysis that included a subway stop and things like you didn't go anywhere. Drivers can sometimes be very false and we as public don't have time to believe that our questions the time I wanted to make sure that our community board members were aware of this, because your questions do take priority. Should the D-O-T be presenting further projects to our community board? If you could all please remember to ask a little more particularly about how they did analysis if they did a sidewalk poll. Did they also do a parking lot poll at the grocery store, or something like that? You know they survey that the subway stop. Did they also survey at the fast-food drive-through or whatever it might take? I really appreciate all you do for your communities and thanks for also keeping an eye out for this kind of bias and discrimination coming from the deity all right. Thank you. So much Margaret, we really appreciate you. Coming is Dress for Success here Dress for Success. They might be here, but I knew did I, muted everybody, because there was so much feedback. So I don't know is what's the name of Dress for Success, miss Reed, unli, miss Reed, I, believe her. The speaker's name is kind ky at the bottom. All right give me one. Second hi.

It's not that so we're gonna move on. Yes, okay, Assemblyman or B. Are you on the line Lily? Can you confirm because I know you came on a little early, hello good evening? Everyone certainly good to hear you I'm, not on video. So I can't see you. It is certainly an opportunity for us to chat for a bit difficult time that we're living in difficult circumstances, as is evidenced by even trying to have meetings virtually you know we are on the Assembly's point of view. It appears that we're getting ready to go back into session next week. We will have a virtual statewide meeting tomorrow, the Assembly Democratic conference, to discuss that we have I believe the opportunity to look back at the quarterly projections that the we'll give us when we passed the budget in April we provided before and before we provided the governor, as you know, with emergency powers to extend certain kinds of controls over both how we spend and what are the financial projections when we started the year in April one, we were already six billion dollars in the red and it is estimated now that will be anywhere between that and sixty billion dollars, based on the kinds of reductions and revenues that we have as well as spending that will you know, we've had to use in order to help the state continue and function as best as possible. Clearly, if you follow and I'm sure you do, the pause is still in effect for New York City, even though different parts of my district another home, and we are hoping that New York based on statistics and numbers will be able to enter the first of the we're sending the pause schedules within the next month or two, but that is always going to depend on how the numbers of this pandemic play out has been the role that the governor has played, I thinking and correctly so for our community. We know that we are in the heart of the pandemic in the city, we've lost any number of friends and neighbors to this disease and have extraordinarily high numbers of people who are tested positive, and so that is continues to be the challenge. What we've been doing is trying to ensure that people have food people have masks. People have these sanitizers that are unnecessary in order to conduct their business as I move around the district. I particularly pay attention to our pantries. You have to really give credit to the pantries that we have, particularly in the East Elmhurst area and parts of Corona, with the perceptive st. Mark's Elm core, the seventh-day adventists vote on Northern Boulevard and on 103rd, and those components have had enormous lines anytime. They open up six to seven hundred people a day coming in we've been partnering with the board presidents office who's helped us bring Fresh Direct to some of those sites and to some of the communities and particularly trying to make sure that homebound seniors get the kind of service they need. All of that has been done in part by some page staff, but a lot of volunteers, and so our thanks goes out to them. We provided some halal meals along with the borough president at Elmhurst Hospital, on to thank workers there, as well as uber cards, that we've been able to distribute to the people who are doing the hardest work, trying to make sure that our community has as much as it needs in this time of need. Nothing, however, will bring us back into. We are able to safely open up and the budgetary impacts are. You know almost unethical based on where we are, but it's our hope that things will continue to go well as I Drive around the district and I'm. You know of that critical age and health condition that I can't do, but I can't have, but so much contact. But what I observed is that people are wearing masks. People for the most part are trying to keep their distance parks that I go see. Are there have a few people are in them, but they're, not overcrowded they're, not putting themselves at risk and I think our citizens need to be applauded for that and the message of doing that has to continually be made. The summertime is going to be very difficult to continue that, but it is essential for to be able to come out of this circumstance in some reasonable fashion. However, my real hope is that there is a vaccine end or a cure found as soon as possible, because it's hard for me to imagine that we're going to be able to return to any normalcy until those things happen, particularly in communities as dense as ours and in a city as best as our unlike other parts of the state, which you know have lots of space and few people. We have a lot of people in very little space, so I'm hoping that will happen. My office has been open. We only bring one person a day in the office other than myself, and we've received a lot of calls, particularly about unemployment insurance, which has been overloaded because of the number of people demanding those services. We've tried to help as people as best as can, and so those kinds of efforts will continue to go on it's what our responsibility years. But again, the cooperation of the people of this community has been great and I hope that, as you do your work at support as it is that those messages you're taking out, certainly for those who are in the thirty-fifth. If you have any needs, please let me know we certainly have masks available as we speak, so that if there are places when you want to distribute mass on your block, please call your office that one eight four five, seven three six one five as well as for any other assistance that we can give you and again I appreciate having the time to just chat with you. I hope you all stay safe, I hope you all will follow the prescription as I'm sure you will about staying away, six feet away, mask and wash your hands as often as you can. Thank you. Thank you so much. We could take at least three questions. Does anyone have any questions? You can just unmute your line, those that are terrible name what you have something mr. chaudhary. If you have a question you can type in the chat, any questions all right. Thank you! So much Assemblyman Aubrey last pleasure. Hopefully, you all be well take care, yeah, that's right and thanks for mentioning about the pantry's and board members folder local food pantries that are there please share with those in the community, and we do have the ones that you mentioned all right, yeah it's! This is commute Queens community board, three in New, York City. Once again, people, if you could please mute your lines, there's a lot of feedback going on. We hear a lot of background noise in a few different people's calls. If you could please be cured courteous by muting your lines, if you're, not speaking, thank you. Alright Jason! Are you ready and then alrighty? So I'm gonna give you this mystery of the screening, another new one. Second I'm gonna, all right! Mister, all right! I got you! Thank you.

But good evening, everybody I'm joined by deputy inspector Duran as well as I believe detective Johnson. You shout out to Detective Johnson, as well as my colleague, brother from another mother, John O'neil who's, your borough planner for you or your night, to talk to you a little bit more about the open streets program. So I'm, just gonna ask everybody to hold off on any questions. I believe you muted everybody, but hang on. Well some questions after the presentation Jason. If they do have any questions while they're thinking about it, they can put it in the chat area. So that goes what we mean will decide how we're going to do this. We don't want any too many distractions. So if anyone has any questions during Jason's presentation, please type it in the chat box. Awesome I appreciate that this is the first time I'm using this one so of the fer to you guys so just some background on the open streets program in April of this year, the City Council introduced a bill with the goal of closing 75 miles of streets for pedestrians and cyclists within one week following this proposal, the mayor and the City Council work together to develop and announced an open streets program with up a hundred miles to be implemented in a phase approach. Now the current goal is to implement 40 miles of open streets within the first month of the program's announcement. The mayor made an official announcement on May 1st and since then, there's been three rounds of open streets. The city has never rolled out a program like this before so we're open to making adjustments as needed, and we're currently working with community boards to fine-tune this process as we go along with the ultimate goal of reach 100 miles, we heard loud and clear from community before 3 we want to be in, but that they want to be involved more. So we were here tonight and we thank you to giovanna Renetta for inviting us here to discuss the process and provide more background on some of the success we've seen so far. So when we were tasked with rolling out open streets program by the mayor, we came up with two typology x'. The first one is open streets adjacent to parks. The thought here was to provide pedestrians, space adjacent to parks or an interior park roads to accommodate growing demand for safe space to social distance. The type this type of open Street is prior priority as where there is existing space, such as a community partner to alleviate demand for the city's highest used open spaces as the weather gets warmer. The second is a full block. Closure. Phobar closures are local streets thoroughfares along strategic corridors, where feasible, while also facilitating economic development, social distancing and active in healthy living. So here are some of the elements of what an open street and the criteria for what an open Street is open. Streets are supposed to be shared spaces for bicyclists and pedestrians. While there are barriers placed by the local precinct, and/or partners at either end of the open streets, they're movable barriers to allow passes for local traffic is limited to local deliveries. Pickups drop-offs, necessary city service utility, and/or, emergency vehicles, drivers are alerted to drive at 5 miles per hour along these roads and to be aware of pedestrians and cyclists. Open streets over 3 hours generally differ, but generally there from 8 to 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. but they might vary slightly depending on staffing ability. The days of the week and open Street is open also varies by locations, and community open streets cannot be proposed on bus routes, truck routes or hospital corridors, and all proposals for open streets must be approved by T ot NYPD, the FDNY and other city agencies, as applicable before being implemented. Currently in Queens. Do T is working closely with local precinct to support this program, but as we continue to roll out more open streets, we hope to reach unity partners such as bids local volunteers, block associations that can help us with implementation. The lengthened s, duration of closure will be determined in partnership with New York City do T and the NYPD some background on the requirements for some of our partners. Proposing organizations must have a strong tie to the community and demonstrate their capacity to manage open streets by providing a staffing plan. Open streets cannot be proposed on Brust routes, as I said, and truck routes and hospital corridors. There are important points to realize because that's one of the main criterias that we're trying to avoid when we're looking at our open street open street closes may be proposed for any number of days in a row or on recurring days, for example, every Saturday or continuously for the entire duration of the program. Closing schedules should take use of the street for deliveries into consideration. However, closures of six hours or more are actually encouraged. Length and duration of a closure will be determined in partnership with the Department of Transportation and D-O-T as well. Barriers will need to be moved, be moveable to ensure emergency vehicles, essentially disposal deliveries and access and access a ride can shift them to enter the given block and replace when they're, when they're done. However, staff areas or professor are actually preferable. Cross streets will remain open, so on May 1st, as I mentioned previously, the first round of open streets were announced, as part of this announcement do t, send every community board and local elected official and Queens and email with the basic requirements for the open streets program, along with a forum link to collect them to collect recommendations. This is the surveys online. This is actually a link to our survey and just gives you a little look at what we have currently right now available on our online portal, we're actively connecting collecting recommendations for feasibility and safety before being approved for the next rollout. We sent this forum link to the community boards all electives and do to partners with the intention that it would be shared with the public read the word after this presentation. We'll share some more information, as well as this presentation with the community board Giovanna and Renetta. So folks in the community can share that with your neighbors and partners. Here's a slide of the open streets website on our web page I just wanted to also give you a sense of what this site looks like here. You'll find a long list of all City locations, as well as the Queen's locations. I want to also just provide you guys with some general overview of what we have right now currently for open streets within the borough. This table are all the Queen streets to date. As you can all see, we have Interior Park roads and Forest Park and Flushing Meadows. Those are part of the first roll out and then adjacent Park Road in Court Square. We're part of that first roll out as well 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights, which first was from 69th Street - 7 th Street, was announced as the second round. The largest announcement of open streets and Queens happened recently actually last week of the 3rd round and that's when we expanded 34th Avenue from 7 th Street to also include 7, E, Street and junction Boulevard. Now hunter miles sounds like a lot, but just keeping in mind that we have 6,000 miles of streets in New, York City. So if we do achieve 100 miles, that's only one point: six miles of city streets that will be used for pedestrians and cyclists with regards to open streets, I want to show you guys some photos and I know. A lot of folks have been I've actually seen: 34th Avenue, here's some snapshots that were taken over the last several days and over the weekend we pulled some of these from our site visits. We also pulled some stuff from the internet and folks had sent us some videos, some shots. We were actually out there. Yesterday, John and I were Commissioner trottenberg. She was thanking volunteers who have created a special connection with 115 precinct and we'll talk a little bit about that success. I want to give a special shout out to Detective Johnson and MPO Lopez, who are out there. Yesterday I met with us to also thank some of the volunteers. Last week before after we rolled out the expansion of 115 of 34th Avenue, we spoke with 115th about their strategy for 34th and they shared with us the community that the community affairs officers are recruited volunteers from the neighborhood and allowed them to take a lead in setting up barriers and as well as taking them down throughout the day. The precinct monitor is this open street with sporadic visits. As you can see in the photos, people live in the buildings. People living in the building's adjacent have the opportunity to find more space, teach your children how to ride a bike, for instance, and as well as just get general exercise during the current. Your current time frame as I said, as we all know, I believe currently right now. 34Th Avenue is an open street from 69th Street down to junction Boulevard. One of the things I just wanted to enter right here is that 34th Avenue has become the most popular Street in the city of New York when it comes to open streets. The type of activity that we're seeing there, along with the partnership between the 115th and our community partners, who are out there every single day, is something that we're actually now trying to emulate in western Queens borough so trying to do that in southern Queens for other for other wrote for the next rollout with community partners. So we're tapping we're gonna, be tapping more into some of those volunteers in 34th Avenue, just to find out what the secret sauce is they're on an effort to emulate in other places. This slide just talks a little bit about some of the requirements for open streets which we had gone over a little bit earlier, but I just want to say. The city has never rolled out a program like this before and we're open to making adjustments as needed if something's not working, we're, certainly up to making those adjustments and or removing areas we're looking also for equitable distribution of locations across the borough, as well as in community, bore three cuz right now. Community bore three: has 1.3 miles of open streets on 34th Avenue, which is a large chunk and just to get to this slide here. The NYPD and City will manage the barriers in most instances, but we're there our organizations with the capacity like 34th, Avenue and internists. We look forward to partnering with them. Some of the requirements expected by my partners are to play some remove barriers at the start and the end of the closure. With that said, we wanna acknowledge the challenges that come along with battery replacement in this. In all cases, we want to help in any way to make those adjustments in communication with local precincts I believe this is sector C. As deputy inspector I've made me aware, we have some great si NCOs in this community who communicate via cell phone and email with our a lot of with a lot of our volunteers and that's been I. Think one of the key components that constant communication also folks are communicating with us at do T. Another requirement that we're asking of our partners is to monitor the closure throughout the day and report any issues to us in the local precinct, we've gotten people feedback from our partners and constituents. This information is very helpful and how to understand how to proceed with the program in other locations, for instance, and 39th, Avenue and Sunnyside gardens. My hometown. We heard loud and clearly from community board too, that we needed more barriers in real time. We were able to add those barriers. We have D-O-T teams that live in the area that are monitoring those barriers. Along with community volunteers. We also added some additional signage, which we're also going to be doing more on 34th, Avenue and other open streets locations, and we're also asking local partners to message locally on how to open streets and to educate their partner, to educate folks in the neighborhood about open streets, and that's pretty much in about the program I'm just going to go back to the title. Page I just want everybody to see that hi Jason's Renetta there's a couple of people that I'm going to call on that posted comments in the chat and I'll. Let them speak and had some questions, but the first person was that I can see. Right now is Megan brach, whoa, unmuted, Megan keV. Please give me one second good evening: yes, love I, just had a couple of questions was wondering what do T's plans were, if any to continue the program post, Co vid, if they were planning on using any of the data and feedback on the program to expand bike lanes or other forms of alternative transportation, given the streets are being used for non vehicular purposes? And lastly, in that vein, if you comment on the proposal to allow restaurants in the streets thanks for that question, those are two great questions. You know we're getting that question a lot actually, especially when we're walking with Commissioner trottenberg down 34th Avenue or things like this gonna remain. Now we don't. We don't have any answers for that. Just now. The things we're seeing with the extent as well as the feedback we're hearing from communities I mean this is the first time a lot of communities are actually having free reign of their streets being able to do recreational activities within them. As we continue to monitor this, you know we want to work with you guys if there's if there was a loud cry to keep this in specific portions of the borough. You know we want to talk to you guys about that. But right now you know I think the goal is to get to a hundred, see how that goes, expand the program and then once we learn more about how the pandemic is going to be lifting off of us, we'll make a determination on whether or not anything will be made permanent, but right now we don't have any plans to make 34th Avenue permanent. With regards to your second question, which is a really great question- and this is something that John and I are really excited and embarking on- is working with businesses to expand an open street to commercial corners in an effort to facilitate businesses. There's a working group that D-O-T is a part of, and Commissioner trottenberg had spoke about that this week during her hearing. Those conversation are currently happening. If the community board has any specific corridors or any businesses that they want to connect us with to start that conversation in an effort to begin this dialogue before the next round of open streets is open, because we want to actually work with business news and community boards to have a commercial corridors entered into the next round. We want to have that conversation, but you guys know these commercial corridors better than we do, and so there might be some exciting opportunities, but we defer to you guys on some of that and as we hear from folks in the community via our website, we're gonna communicate that back team work with you guys on what works best and what's feasible for community board three, all right and Jason. One thing: I didn't ask the inspector if he had any words inspector well, sorry, we should. We should give refer them to yes, because they were supposed to be able to be with it inspector. Are you there? It's okay, he did an outstanding job. Listen again! I just want to thank Adrian and Mario, taking the lead on this recruiting volunteers to UM put up the berries at the beginning at the end of the day. I think that's what's made this so successful is that the community actually wants it and they have an input in what's going on over there. So again, thank you, agent and Mario and all to the community to the community members that are helping out with these barriers. So it takes a big responsibility or fallbacks. You know, that's it all right! The next speaker is Lilly did Lilly. Did you have a comment? I see you posted something in the chat? No okay, yeah good. We can't hear you now you have to unmute okay, yeah me. Yes, we can. Okay, import of the slides. I saw a Mister Softee truck, so all the streets open to vendors. Also, technically, you know a mr. Softee isn't a categorized as a food bender as I understand. I know we have a food. The mr. Softee that comes to 7 th Street over at Travers I saw them there. Just yesterday. You know the streets aren't closer access. You know, folks, I can still use them. There, they're not supposed to be used. As for through streets, we haven't seen I haven't heard and the 115th you know, can jump in if they heard any issues or concerns with mr. soft with mr. softy on 34. But one thing mr. softy should not be doing and if mr. softy is doing is driving from 69th Street East down 34th the whole duration. You know playing the jingle that we all love, because it's the open street is not meant for that purpose. It's more so meant for people. So if you guys had hear anything or see any issues with mr. Softee or any other trucks that are flouting the open street over here, please let us know we can reach out I'm out and about so it's John we're cycling to your neighborhoods, checking on things and making sure things are right and we can also stop and have a conversation with folks and date and Jason for the safety of those that are walking. What's the process for the vehicles that need to come in and out, that's right there on a 34th Avenue. Yes, so the several times that I've been down I've been out there or watching it, and now it's how it does work and how we expect it to work is if you're, if you're, if you you're, let's say here on you- know: you're approaching 69th Street on 34th Avenue, just east, and you want to get you want to park outside of PS 361, because there's an available spot. We ask that you reposition the barrier, move your car and then move the barrier. Back yesterday when I was on 34th Avenue I saw a handful of folks coming out of a resident friend said one on one and since a gentleman was going into the parking lot and one of the larger residential buildings, he moved the barrier pulled this car out of the parking lot within the building and then which is beautiful and then gather than its pupil and then move to backward. That's the best instance. Now in some instances you know folks aren't moving that barrier back. You know and we're asking that additional vigilance, we're not seeing that happen. You know I'm, not hearing about that happen happening as much as I am in other locations in western Queens, where we have had issues and we have made adjustments because of those issues. So you know that's the typical process, but of course you know if we're, if we're seeing or hearing issues, because this is one thing that I want to be very sensitive to, or you know folks with disabilities and/or folks with or seniors who don't have the ability to physically move a barrier. We want to talk to you. We want to hear from you we wanna to hear if there's an issue with that, we want to make it work better for you. So please feel free to share my contact. Information and I can connect it so Jason we have like maybe three more comments. That's gonna Nuala! You want to say your comment quickly. They're gonna go through these quickly, Nuala all right. Is she there all right? So basically, Nuala said she says: thanks Jason, for working with the community to open up 34th Avenue from 69th to Junction. When can we expand 114th, Street and Hinton Park? We have volunteers ready to help yeah. If you know, if you have, if you have volunteers, ready to help, please point them in our direction. When it comes to expanding. You know I just want to talk about the process right I'm on connectivity issues. You know we're actively talking with the precinct about expanding, but there are some concerns with expanding that area that has GCP access and there's also access from the east to get to junction, which is a major commercial corridor, so we're actively having that conversation. But if you want to tap, if you want to get us in touch with some of those some of those partners to have that conversation, I think it would actually help I'll push along the conversation and after three, all right from the east and west were on a civic associations, and we don't agree with their going down in it. We need to talk alright, so that's ok, Lorinda the next person Arthur suggested that they get a city bike to open up along 34th, Avenue and other open streets and comment. The 34th Avenue was a good choice because it's primarily a residential Avenue and there's a wide divider down the middle of the street. That would be an excellent place for city bike. To set up you know bikes either permanently, or you know just for the direction of the of this experiment. So a see if you can coordinate with city by Bank city bike to put up a couple of stands somewhere along the boat that stretch all right thanks. Arthur. Do you have a quick comment on that? Jason cuz? We still have a number of speakers, but I just wanted to yeah. The agency does have plans to expand city bike further east in Queens. That's not that's! Not on the book! Still a number of years right now we're focusing up in Washington Heights. We just expanded to the hospital up there and then we're gonna be focusing on areas of the Bronx and then infill and CB one and then CB two before we get to see b3 so right now we don't have any news but I'll work to share the last update about city bike expansion within Queens with you Renetta, so you can share with members of the board as well. Alright and so Marcus I have question okay, so okay I'll get you I'm just going to the folks that had a chat and I'll come down to you, Margaret Flanagan say your 150 seconds. When your comment short things, you can also read it just says some of the open streets are crowded like by Travis Park, and it might help if folks follow traffic flow. Everybody heading east on one side, everybody heading west. On the other side that helps keep distance, maybe like in the grocery store. You can tape down some arrows or something like that. All right, Thank, You, Margaret, Lorinda I, know that you I'm trying to do it in the order. That reason why I apologize for cutting you off, but do you just want to say, because you said a small part of your comment? But can you just say exactly what you have brought here in the chat? Okay, I just wanted to say that there's so much traffic congestion down here at 114 and 34th Avenue, Northern Boulevard, a story of Boulevard by Hinton Hawk to get onto the expressway. The only way to us even get from the story of Boulevard around to story millet is that 114th Street that 140 Street is an integral part of us getting around from that side of East Elmhurst. So there's anything happening in that area. Please, let's have a discussion because there's not gonna work. The traffic jam is too much. We can't handle all right. This is di Durant I totally agree with you. That was my concerned. Also. Junction is also a very busy corridor. Even now, with that not a lot of traffic, you could see the congestion building up there. You know, with the truck with the trucks and the cars pulling in and out of the supermarket right now, the Food Bazaar, but you right in the corner of our junction and on and on nine Junction and I believe is 95. I agree with you, I, don't think you should go all the way down all right so to discuss this further I'd like to hear more your thoughts on that. Actually, all right, -, I, know I know. Two individuals who are Jews are traffic and transportation share. I know: Steve colonic has a comment and I don't know if it has a comment. Also, but Steve can you say your comment that you posted here, yeah I was just curious because collaborate, how much community groups are involved with involved with maintaining and monitoring the open street on 34th Avenue, if you can provide contact informations to the community board regarding those groups yeah. So, as we said earlier, the preaching has been coordinating with loads local volunteers, I'm, not aware of any larger group. If those local volunteers are part of that larger group, then forgive me for not knowing that, but as I understand it now it's a handful of local volunteers along the route on 34th Avenue volunteers, stripped in and drift out, and this - my concern there's a volunteer of the organizational capacity to maintain this. We haven't seen any issues right now. Summer hasn't hit yet true, you know, and as the summer moves on- and you know we start- we continue looking at 34th in areas. If we do see volunteers fall off, we will make an adjustment if the barriers aren't being maintained. Well, so there's no organization. That's taking on responsibility for no I mean not that I know of that have reached out to us that the volunteers are individual volunteers, as I was made aware the other day when we met with them. We have about one each block or one like one. Each section there's like a western section, a central section and an eastern section where folks are communicating directly with the 115th about installation of those barriers day and night. You know I applaud the speed, but I applaud the speed with what you've managed to do this. It's true, that's really commendable, but I do think. You need to look at getting a little bit more structure with the volunteer group, especially if you're looking to maintain this going forward and over any length of time. Volunteers come and volunteers go, and you need to be mindful of that. That's all I'm saying that's a concern and that's something that we're gonna keep monitoring all right. Thank you and Ed Kernan. Do you have anything to say? Okay, I, don't hear from I'm gonna move on. So if you do one question about the cleanliness of the street I'm down the order, boy Martha go ahead: toy hi everyone good evening. Yes, that was my question. I just wanted to know a little bit about the efforts to keep the streets clean and free from trash and litter. Given the high volume of traffic, individuals will soon probably go out and try and sell food and unfortunately, everyone, sometimes people just like to throw things in the street and with alternate side of the street parking being suspended for as long as it has been just wanted to know what efforts are. Our planning has been done around that Thank You Joyce ASB kicked off this week and it's gonna go on a little hiatus for some of the religious holidays this weekend towards the end the next week. I, don't know the days off the top of my hat in my head, but I also provide that to Renetta too now we gave it to we sent that actually to Giavanna on Tuesday after we did a presentation for all borough boards, but that's also another concern for us when we had the open streets when we announced the second round, ASP was suspended for the duration of time, we're seeing issues with cleanliness. Now that ASP has been reinstituted, we're gonna continue to monitor and we'll work closely with DDS and why we had a conversation about open streets with DSM. Why the other day and John, who runs the lead and keeping in touch with us, and why we'll continue to monitor with myself, too and I, know: okay, so Martha you go and Nuala. If you want to cannula mentioned here that this number of volunteers is 34th, Avenue, open streets coalition has an abundance of volunteers and they working with over 10 community groups to volunteer okay Martha your comment and then Miss Reed and then we'll move on to the next speaker and we're gonna, ask Chamber of Commerce to go next. Go ahead, Martha, Jason, I agree with Lorinda 114th Street needs to be looked at separately, because that area is highly trafficking and we have issues with the traffic and Martha can I. Just sorry for a minute and I know. Lorinda mentioned and I know. Jason mentioned that stuff early with Lybrand and so on. The community gourd would definitely like to be part of that conversation, as he mentioned that we should all be working together and I know that we get various concerns reported to the office. So we want to bring that to the meeting. Also look ahead, Marty good again, oh, but we do all need to be part of that conversation, because once this is over- and you know, there's a little more traffic I'm seeing a lot more traffic on Roosevelt Avenue I have construction sites going on. So I know that 114 is just as bad, and you know the issue with the garbage. I have to go out and clean every day, because I don't see things being cleaned and people are throwing everything into the streets and on the sidewalks from the mass to the gloves to everything. So we need to be part of the conversation with the traffic over there, as well as in other parts of our community. All right I'll certainly give you a call tomorrow, -, all right, so I have a coma okay, so I'll, let you know it. Thank you. Jason I'm, a president of the Jackson Heights beautification group and we're getting some pushback from residents along 34th Avenue trash was one of the issue, but other than that they had large groups gathering partying down closer to the bowling alley. If you will so these are unintended consequences. I know, but you mentioned something about. This would not be a permanent situation. In terms of this street being closed, are you indicating that it will be moved around within our neighborhood No? So it's going to be permanent? No, nobody said it was gonna, be permanent. I repeat when I said earlier, we're gonna keep the program on for as long as the pause order is on. We don't have a final end date for this. Just like we all our data day-to-day with a lot of our real lives. Yet that's what's going on with this program. So you know this constant conversation and this dialogue is actually very valuable and we want to keep maintaining it with you folks. You know in instances where we're seeing folks, you know partying or gathering and mass, as you had said, you've seen it. You know we want to know about that. We want to have that reported directly to the precinct. Another good thing to mention is the mayor had mentioned the other day, the group of an ambassador program, some of our DoD colleagues, are participating in this. These are resources that are going to be allocated out into communities throughout the city to have conversations with folks who aren't social distancing. So we have another layer of vigilance. That's going to be added to open streets sometime soon. So not only will you have you know the NYPD upset D-O-T along with volunteers. You also have this other layer of ambassadors who's going to be walking around soon all right, one more question the inspector for the one: five, it's his question: actually, is there going to be a dedicated line, so our residents can call up and get somebody to answer that phone that we have a problem well depending on the problem, is an emergency that you always call 9-1-1, but on most of the volunteers in the area have a lot of straight open line of communication without with Adrian and Mario and again you can always call 3-1-1 we're always monitoring it on. We haven't heard any issues with kind of people congregating or anything with social distancing. Nothing on you know everything comes to t11, so a below keep monitoring is the NCOs are always out there talking people making sure everybody I'm abides by the rules as much as possible, but we'll keep looking into it. But I think the program is working great is it you know? Are we gonna have a couple of bumps in a row and make some adjustments absolutely, but we're ready for that all right, Thank You inspector, miss Reid you're. The final everyone I want to thank Jason, do T and the 115th precinct for coming out and speaking on the issue of open streets. As you see, there are number of issues that need to be discussed, so we are going to try to convene a meeting as soon as possible since just today there are some other issues that have come up. So a traffic transportation committee meeting is warranted, so Jason and John will be getting back to you without the date that our committee meeting will be held. Thank your honor for joining us. Thank you. Thank you, Jason, John and Inspector for being with us this evening. So now we're going to move into the crux of our meeting where we going to be focusing on our business owners and I know that Tom Richie from the Queen's Chamber of Commerce said that he has to go soon. So I like him to be the first presenter, followed by small business services. So Kevin can you unmute, Tom and I'm going to share the screen with him. I am unmuted and my cameras on I just need to have access to the screen. All right, so I'll make you the presenter and welcome. No thank you. There we go. Can you guys see that not yet now we can see it all right, terrific everybody I know a lot of folks on the phone and I wanted to give a shout out to Jason. If he's still there, he is my go-to guy for do. T things and Queens and I think you'll probably agrees a terrific asset. We appreciate all he does. I wanted to just thank the community board three for allowing me to come and present the Queen's chambers been around since 1911 I'll be celebrating five years there. This July and I think to a person. We've never been in a situation like this before in the history of our country, our city, our state, but I just want you to feel at least some sense of relief. That help is on the way it looks like things are starting to clear up for the middle of June, which seems like an awfully long time away, since we shut the doors of our city in March, but I wanted to give you a brief overview of the Queen's Chamber in general. For those that don't know us and then let you know some of the things that we're doing to help the cause again, we've been around since 1911, and we've been talking about advocacy networking in education since day, one we're currently located we're neighbors in East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights in the Bulova Corporate Center, which you folks probably all know it's a great location. We just added more space about six months ago and where we've been growing by leaps and bounds, we represent one hundred and eleven hundred and fifty members representing over a hundred thousand Queens based employees. Those members represent a lot more employees, but I count just my Queens employees, as especially near and dear to our heart. We have over 350 annual events in 2019, attended by thousands of people. Obviously, all of our events have been canceled or curtailed, and that's just the way it is we're fighting through that. A very interesting stat for those on the call 90% of our membership 90% have less than 10 people at this time. Now, more than ever, it's incredibly important. We count the big boys like citi bank and Maspeth Federal, Savings, Bank and Con Ed and National Grid as our members. They help keep the lights on, but our bread and butter and those that we that we consider our everyday heroes are our small business men and women. We all know we're home till JFK and LaGuardia airports, I drove to the office just today from where I live, and it was sad to see not a single airplane up in the sky and no traffic on the Grand Central, which is normally a good thing to see. But in this environment it's just very painful. We are home the seven colleges and universities and for the record I've reached out to every one of those presidents, whether they're interim or active presidents of those seven colleges we're having a call next week and how we can get folks that have been unemployed through no fault of their own job train for new opportunities and also make sure they're current students with over 90,000 students that are in those colleges and universities, have opportunities for internships and then and then getting themselves placed afterwards. You probably all know that our biggest segment of employment is health care transportation. It's a largest segment of employee in those areas are hit very hard. Our board chair is Tom. Santucci might be a name that you know his dad. John Santucci was the DA many moons ago he's an active participant in things in Queens and he's our chair I've been involved in fortune, 500 things and companies for 35 years, I'm involved in a lot of different organizations. It's important to know that our staff today speaks nine different languages across the board. We're very active we've added a lot more people and we're doing a lot more, a lot more interesting things in the community. We have a 35 member Board of Directors and since I got there fully. Fifty percent are new, with a large segment of those folks being people of color women, Asian folks and so on. A true representation of the borough of Queens we're trying to position ourselves as partners with all the other things. All the other groups in Queens County, since the kovat hit I host a one o'clock, Tuesday conference call with all the bids and Merchants associations in Queens County and to that effort. I heard lots of rumblings about concerns about graffiti and crime, since the cove it hit and I had police. Commissioner Dermot Shay on the line who addressed everybody and talked about the redeployment of police. Now that both City field and Yankee Stadium are closed. There's not nearly as many cops required there. Those folks are being redeployed throughout the city. My hat is off to those and the NYPD I think he told me they lost 89 people, both civilian and uniformed, so our hearts go out to them for their hard work. At the height of this thing, they had a 20% reduction in staff for the most part he said, they're back and they've all been redeployed out in the community. So that's a good thing: we've developed strong partnerships with small business services used to be Greg Bishop, there's a new guy in there named Janelle Doris, who just started last week. We're gonna have him on a call in two weeks talk about some of the things that he's doing and the rest of it. Just basic information about the chamber. I wanted to be able to answer any questions that folks might have regarding anything going on. I want to continue to do my outreach to bids partnerships and community boards. I want to continue to grow our MWBE expansion across all the airports hopefully get back on track soon and other operations and other opportunities in Queens County I wanted to open up for any questions from anybody. Dominican bored and I wanted to thank you all for your support and thank you Thomas, thank you for being here and thank you for all that you're doing in the community and remember, please use the community board as a source. If you have to share any information of any programs that you are giving that's open to the community, Kevin I think we may have to unmute all for a second and see. You ask questions because I know there's a number of folks that are on the phone and everyone you're. Not speaking, can you please make your line all right, we're going to go back? Okay, they're! Your do you want love song had a question. Yes, he did does any. If you have a question, please place it in the chat, Lobsang I'm just looking for him. He can unmute himself I'm pretty sure there. He is alright. My last song go ahead. Okay, so my question: is there any veterans on business, auto representative in the bar mr. Thomas unmuted? Oh, he can unmute himself Thomas. Can you unmute yourself please and answer that question? Yes, thank you. We have a number of people that are on the board, not on the board that are members of the chamber that are veterans as a matter of fact, I'm happy to let you know if you are, in fact the veteran thank you for your service and anybody else on the call. It's also important to note that one of our members, a fellow named James Hendon, just recently became the Commissioner of Veterans Affairs he's a good friend and great stuff alright, and we got your link on mr. Gretch that we will share. I know that our business echo chairs on the line Edmund Rosenbaum Edmund. Can you be on the move? Edmund I'm, pretty sure you can I mute himself, but I'll try any questions for alright. If they just say before, I go a couple quick things: there's a lot of resources available at the chamber website which I just sent to everybody remarkable you've. Probably all heard about the disaster of the Triple P put up on the Small Business Administration right earlier this week and part of last week was the deadline for companies who received money and for whatever reason, public pressure places like Ruth's, Chris, Steakhouse, Harvard, University and those that got the money and said you know what this is not what I bargained for the government allowed them to give the money back and I can tell you right now that billions and billions of dollars has been returned that people can go apply for so if anybody on the call had any issues whatsoever about getting in the information I'm typing my email address as we speak, and you need help with the application. I am happy to jump on board and help people apply. For that. Other thing, I want to say in a sobering way, is there's six thousand restaurants in Queens County, six thousand about 25,000 in the city of New York. It is my estimation, sadly, that maybe half of those will never see the light of day, so I intend to give every resource. I can I'm seeking funding at the federal level, the state level and the local level to help put resources for some job training for those folks that have been displaced and to help in any way we can get them up and running. There's also a website that we built over the last couple weeks. It's called Queens best org, it's a listing of hundreds of restaurants that offer takeout services. So if you need anything, please go there. We also have a platform called operation, Main Street that allows people, especially local folks, here, to buy gift cards for restaurants and Queens. It's also on our website. Alright, thank you. So much and, as you know, the community board still enjoys working with you and, as I mentioned, please share any information with us that we can share with those in the community when you do have programs, I shall and Giavanna. Thank you for your kindness and everybody else on this board. Thank you for your volunteerism I'm one of the ones. That's lucky enough to get paid for what I do and I love what I do, but my email was there don't be bashful. You have a concern. You have a question. Your business needs help. Please reach out I'd be happy to help alright. Thank you so much dad. Thank you Thomas. Thank you very much for supporting or second largest parade in New York City for Halloween. The children's parade. You're very well done doing that for several years. Your website is exhausting, it's really geared for small businesses. So let me get to my question. Look into your crystal ball. When are we going to be able to reopen our small businesses? So that's a really good question, sir. If I had the answer, I'd probably be the richest man in America, but I'm not, but I will say that it's gonna be a slow, laborious process. Unfortunately, the ones I mentioned that are in the most distressed, restaurants are the most susceptible I was asked to be in the mayor's committee for small business with a bunch of other folks and the notion of a light switch where businesses would open and people would flock to them is probably far off the other notion of having restaurants, open at say, 50% capacity or even 75%, with the restaurant tour's tell me and when I tell the mayor and other people is that you can't pay the property taxes, you can't pay the rent. You can't pay the insurance at 50, 75 percent operating capacity. They need to fill them up. Take out only go so far for those who eat out a lot and I am a very happy jolly 260 pounder because of all I eat in Queens County. They make their money on the before. During and after dinner drinks take outs, don't pay all the bill, so we've got to find a way and we're gonna work on some different ways to even have seating in restaurants, that'll be I, wouldn't say sequestered, but with some type of plexiglass to allow people. The ability to eat in but, as importantly, what we're trying to really drive home is the restaurant tors need to make sure that their guests know they're in a safe environment. So while it might look, might not look wonderful to have somebody with gloves and a mask, we want to make sure that those restaurants are ready, willing and able to accept people have a wonderful evening and we're going to move on to our next speaker, mr. Eric, from the small business services. Thank you so much hey welcome, hi, good evening. Everyone. Can you see my screen? Yes, we can hallelujah everyone. How are you? My name is Eric proper with the department's more business services I'm an outreach liaison I attending cp3 meetings intermittently for a number of years now so I know Giovanna pretty well. We've discussed many issues that have been taking place in CB 3 over the years and I'm just happy to be here this evening to talk about what SPS is doing for small businesses since the beginning of the covert crisis, SPS is transitioned to an online platform like most organizations and government agencies, so just to quickly give you an overview of what we do at SPS and then I'll talk about specifically how we responded to the covert 19 crisis from the from day, one to current to the current days so department, small business services. We help unlock economic opportunities to all new yorkers who are seeking to start operate and expand in New York, a small business. We support small individual businesses by providing one-on-one assistance and counseling, as well as financing assistance. We support neighborhoods by administering 76th Business Improvement Districts throughout the five boroughs, and we also have the workforce, one centers that provide jobs for jobseekers, as well as a skilled staff for employers looking to hire staff since the inception or since the beginning of the covert 19 crisis, SPS again as trans we've sort of transition to online platform. But we are still providing our services through our NYC business solution. Centers anyone see a business solution. Centers are located in all five boroughs, but at the moment they are providing their services online 101 technical assistance. Most people are talking about the PPP and the economic injury disaster loan programs that are being administered by the SBA but SBS. We continue to have partnerships with over 40 micro lenders to help small businesses get the funding that they need in order to operate, expand and to save they're. In these circumstances to actually save their small businesses, we are providing still providing counseling in the areas of compliance consultation services. One of the questions we've been getting from a lot of businesses is that, as the curve starts to flatten and businesses transition back into their spaces, what would they need to know what kind of regulations are going to be in place? Well, we've been discussing, we would have those conversations with our partner agencies like Consumer Affairs and the health department, and talking about specifically, what would that look like what kinds of information can we give the businesses to help them smoothly transition back into their commercial spaces and we're going to be putting together a webinar, an educational webinar in a couple of weeks and it's short period of time on best practices for small businesses what they need to do in order to transition back into their spaces? Well, there need to be any regulations. We need to be an inspection. It's a lot of questions, we're getting, but we're going to have information on that in a short period of time. As we see what the governor decides to do with regards to flattening the social distancing, rules and regulations are lightening those up and allowing businesses to reopen again. So since the code, nineteen crisis SPS did administer a small business grant, as well as a small business loan. Those funds were depleted pretty quickly, but it was only meant to be a bridge into the SBA program of products came into play and became available. So at this time, if you are small business and you did apply for any one of our programs- and you had some issues submitting your application or you had some or you cannot go any reason- we are reviewing applications at this time, those that were able to actually submit those applications before their deadlines. We can still review those applications. If you have an application in. You can contact me if you have a question about the grant, a loan program that SBS was administering. In the meantime, we are hosting daily webinars on kovat 19 assistance. You can go to our vent web page I'll share the link with Renata and basically we are providing online trainings for businesses who are not. If you were not prepared for this online platform, we are providing training for small businesses in order to allow them to help them get an online presence to sell their goods or services. We have a number of different organizations that there are grants and loans that are available from small organization and microlenders. All that information is on our webinars again. We are hosting them on a daily basis. I'll share the Eventbrite link, but you can sign up for business courses like online platform how to market your business quickbooks some of the other kinds of offerings. We have one, of course, called fast-track tech 4. It's a six to eight week, commitment for small businesses and it really dives deep into just the online presence and how to actually conduct business online. So for more details, you can go to our website nyc.gov folks, west cove, it 19 biz for a full list of all of the services that SPS provides for those businesses who are concerned about what kinds of safety measures of best practices they need to adopt in order as they reach as they're transitioning back into their business and go to the health department's website at nyc.gov, slash Kovac virus and get some pointers on how to disinfect your business, safeguard it from the spread of corona virus. And if you want to get updated information, how information is changing on a daily basis, so we are asking folks you can text Kovac to six nine, two, six, nine two for details on any of the changes that are happening and they are happening very rapidly again, I'm open to any questions you may have and be well stay safe and contact me if they have any questions or concerns. Thank you. Does anyone have any questions? I don't see? Okay, so ed Wesley had a question. Do you want to say what your question is? I know that you had asked a similar question to the Queen's Chamber, but you can ask this SBA from their perspective, ed all right. What ed asked was when do you think small business will be able to open in New York City, because we know how much they're suffering at the moment. Yes I know, and you know like Thomas mentioned earlier. We are. We are waiting for word from the governor, of course, I'm watching listen for updates on basis, I guess that's gonna all depend I mean when we get notified that business is gonna start to open again we will make that known to the public, but at this time I don't have information on that I mean I, can't even speculate. It all depends. I mean on a day-to-day basis, I see things changing with regards to the curve, flattening and then another you know more outbreaks taking place in certain places. I mean it just don't know just very hard to tell at this time a restaurants to last in phase four. Are they the last to be able to reopen I'm, not sure that sir sorry I think that they are on phase three? This is lastly, Ramos from the 82nd Street partnership and we're gonna. Have you speak up after him yesterday, but okay, good? Thank you. Thank you.

You know again, you can go into our vent web page and participate in our daily webinars and it is full of information on kovat 19 assistance for small businesses. We are providing updates every day, there's a load of information on grants, loans, as well as utility assistance. You know, I know that the utilities are providing some kinds of relief for businesses that have a utility, whether it be gas service, whether it be light service. There are some specific information on businesses that can get relief at this time. Extensions on licenses as well licenses and permits the department, Consumer Affairs, has extended the license, expiration dates and in some cases, as late as July in August a few months, they're extending the expiration date on some of the licensing Eric we're being asked.

Okay, could you say it verbally and yes, you can email me at a Parker at SBS nyc.gov. You can call me you can call my number at two one, two, six one, eight four six!

So please share this information with our business owners and the presentation that you have you can share with us also, so we can place it on our website and through our social media, will do only the first few slides of an entire presentation. I don't have time to really go through with the whole entire presentation, but I can certainly share it and miss Reed. Do you have any comments or your good repeat? The phone number. Please serve repeat your phone number, please Eric, -, one, two, six one, eight four six email address is Eve Parker EPA, our keer at SBS, as in small business services, not nyc.gov, and please everyone remember. He mentioned the Eventbrite, please there's so many services that they provide. It's SBS. Please go to the website. Please find that information so that I encourage our business owners. There is support out there I'm going to 99 p.m. so. Thank you so much. Thank you. So much I appreciate it all right, 82nd Street, you have a minute. Yes, what do you mean? Everyone is nice to see some of you, even though it's just virtually I just wanted to just give. You announce meant about two things that we're doing to help our small businesses as well. Give you an update of on 82nd Street. Things are really rough for many of our businesses and the community we lost to business owner within our district and just one adjacent to our district. Like the Chamber said, we have experienced a lot of graffiti and one of our businesses was vandalized. We also been very active not only with my district, but, as you show, we have stepped out to help businesses beyond our district, because it's seriously a need for an organization that can provide hands-on services to businesses from Jackson highs, all the way to Corona. First, if we have in our website, we have created several pages. One page is about information about copy 19 resources for the businesses we have in Spanish in the English we're trying to update as much as we can. But if you know for information, I recommend people to follow us on social media, where we are more active and putting informational, regular basis. We also have a list of all the open businesses on 82nd Street on our website as well. Try to update it at a minimum of once per week. So two things that we are doing this Wednesday. We are going to be giving free mass to small businesses. This is a second round that we are doing is going to be from 11:30 to 3:00 at 82nd 11 the same building where their community boards located, but we're just gonna, be on there in the basement. The reason that we're doing this is because our businesses are struggling PPP is very expensive. I know that there is a spike in prices, a little price gouging going on in that neighborhood and now they're required to provide protection equipment to their staff, so we're trying to help them as much as possible as they get on their feet. They are, we did it last week and it was amazing. We have businesses come from all the way from Corona from Jackson Honda in the numbers that were very graceful, but you can see in their eyes the fear and the sadness about what is happening to their businesses. Every Tuesday at 3 p.m. in collaboration with the Queen's Chamber. We have workshops in Spanish, we started this program called inter amigos is among friends is a collective for spanish-speaking businesses. We enter this space to fill a gap that what we were finding in the city were a lot of small businesses owned by spanish-speaking people who are not getting enough information. The program has been amazing. We are streaming across various platform, Instagram Facebook, soon and collectively we have had the last session we had over. 900 people participate, so we are doing this with limited resources, but we obviously hit a spot. So we provided information about financing SBA in other loans we are providing. We have had a few sessions about how to protect employees in customers. We actually one of them, was done by a local resident from Jackson Heights Letizia Ortiz. We also had an OSHA trainer come in, so our idea is to get the businesses to be ready to understand the law to understand how to obtain help. A big thing among us is that many of our businesses are not prepared. They don't have the right documentation, they don't know what to get with help to help. So we are trying to help them to do that. So I don't know. If anyone has any questions, any questions for Leslie. Thank you for what you're doing with the masks and so on for those business owners. I know that it's well needed now, so Leslie. Thank you for your hard work, but they work. Sorry I just want to say it. I'm posting my direct email for you, daddy, can you say your email and your telephone number, and also it's to type it in the chat? Yes, so my phone number is seven one, eight, three, five, nine four, two one. He was a message. We are checking messages regularly and we also stopping by the office on races as well. My email is lastly at 80 seconds three, or that is the best way to reach me. I just want to say that if you have any business, even if they're, not in our district, you could send them to us, because we will try. We will connect them to organizations that can help them. We understand the issues affect a lot of mom-and-pop shops in immigrant businesses, and so we have like a nice network of people who are sensitive to those issues. So we cannot do a lot of one on one assistant, but we can do referrals to people who helped all right. Thank, You Leslie have a great night and keep safe. You too, thank you. James from the controllers office. You have a minute James. You can unmute James and lead yourself, James unmute, you, ok, I'm unmuted right, yes, ok, yeah, hi everybody, so I have a few updates. The first one is that the kovin 19 resource guide that out came out a few weeks ago now, actually a bit over a month ago. It's recently been updated with more information, so please check out the k√∂ppen 19 resource guide. It has information for people that are tenants for homeowners, for people that need food assistance, I think it's the most comprehensive set of information for New York City residents, so not only hasn't, been updated since I last spoke about it, it's also been translated into traditional Chinese and Spanish, and next week it will likely be translated into Bengali as well all languages. It should be fairly useful for this general area, especially as Spanish in Bengali, and the price will probably also be translated into French as well next week. So please check that out. Please send it to anyone who you think may need it. Second thing: the comptroller's office, Bureau of labor law, has just started an initiative few weeks ago now it's a phone bank and we initiative where we're trying to find people that are owed money. Now these are people who worked on city projects. These are projects in which a contractor was given the right to work on a project to maybe build something for the city and they were supposed to pay people a certain way to the prevailing wage. In many cases, the contractors failed to pay people to correct wage, so people were getting paid, but not at the amount that they were actually entitled to get so there's. Currently, 2.5 million dollars worth of unclaimed wages that have been awarded to people and we're trying to the office is trying to identify these people through phone banking. But you don't have to wait to be called because a lot of these people, we don't have correct numbers or updated addresses for if you go to our website and I'll punch this into the chat, you can search your name or anyone's name. If you know someone who worked on a project like this, they should punch their name in and they can see if they are, if they can get any money, there's a lot of people who don't even realize that they're owed money, because they don't realize that they were not paying the correct rate. In fact, the Community Board for district manager said that he punched some names and it found out that people he knew were actually owed money. So please spread the word on that. A lot of the people on that list, their last known address, was either in Jackson, Heights, Corona or East Elmhurst, and some of the other nearby areas - like Woodside in Elmhurst all right next thing we just did a special report on the Board of Elections. This has been going on for a while. The report shows that the Board of Elections election day activities and protocols often fail to meet federal and state standards. So if you're interested in that, please check that out. Last thing: I'll also put this in the chat, we're doing a weekly newsletters. Now some of you on this call already God got it I emailed it out to some of you. The weekly newsletter will have updates on the fiscal health of the city. You know the general in general numbers on the economy, and this month it focused on the importance of the summer youth programs that may be cut in the city budget. So, if you're interested in any of that, please check that out again. I'll punch that into the chat once I'm done speaking and that's all. Thank you all right. Thank you. So much James, and can you just burp Elysees the website that you said that folks can go to see the money that they have and so on and so forth? You remember the website if you could just say what we have it on the tape just in case those and once someone plays it back, you want them to go to your website. Are you speaking I? Don't hear you? Oh you don't hear me. Okay, I hear you! Oh you do. Yeah I can hear you, okay, thank you for honor, good Jay. James will just type your website in okay, I'd like to invite Delores who's from the office of the State, Controller, Thomas DiNapoli, to say a few words hi good evening. Thank you, Miss nglish, thank you. It was frayed were always hosting these great district cabinet meetings. I can't believe it's almost a year that we did the economic snapshot of the Greater Jackson Heights area, and there were so many good things going on in this community board. And now you know things have fallen because of this cop√°n 19 pandemic and I. My heart goes out to all the small businesses and to all the first line workers and to the you know, everyone who is really suffering through this, but it's getting back to some of these small businesses as Tom grush spoke about. We work together very closely with him and also the small business programs. We also have the persuit lending and that's something that we invest in, and it's money there to help small businesses that needed it's, not the big businesses, it's for the small businesses of New, York, State and there's over 15 million dollars that was made available to small businesses for this loan program would pursuit lending. It was formerly the NYPD C program. The interest rate on these loans is only about 1% and there is money still out there. They're looking for people, so I'm gonna put the website up there for the 82nd Street bid to look at them. Maybe it could be helpful to some of our small businesses I'm going to be meeting with Tom crush I'm, going to put it up there, along with some of our other information. Also, we also did up. We have put up a Koba, 19 financial toolkit. It's a resource guide, it's statewide! It has a lot of good information about health stimulus relief, so I'm going to put that up there as well, and that continues to change and it gets updated regularly as things change and also we are the holders of unclaimed money. So there is over 15 billion dollars sitting in unclaimed funds when I urge you I'm going to urge everyone to go on our website. What plug in your name, plug in your friends names your neighbors names see if anybody is owed any money. This is especially a time like this. Any little anything helps and most of the claims can be done right online and if they are, if you are successful in putting them in online, you will receive a check in just a couple of weeks. Oh put all these websites up, but if you want to navigate on your own, you can just go to our website, which is WWE city NY, u.s. and you'll be able to find the COPE at 19 you'll also be able fines, unclaimed funds I'm going to give you my email. If anybody needs to reach me, it's dc-8 P, as in Peter AC e @ OS, C DOT, NY govt. Thank you. Thank you so much Dolores. Well.

You can't see it in the folder, so I new york city has been in a state of emergency since March 7 2020. How are you my fellow board members? How are you really doing? Is that what our governor said the other day we have all been impacted mentally physically and spiritually by koba 19 many families in East, Somers, Jackson, Heights and North corona are suffering from the loss of family members and loss of income. The lines at our local food pantries are overwhelming to see residents of all different backgrounds and ages. Standing on line for hours to get food right for their next meal is frightening. It's a frightening reality. I would like to say thank you to all of our local political representatives for their food donation initiatives. I. Also like to thank many of you, Queens community board through members who have collected and distributed items and have made financial donations to those to those many causes. We know the residents of East, Thomas, Jackson, Heights and North Korea are very generous and are always ready and willing to give to their neighbors so I. Thank you. Over the last few weeks, you've heard of Koba 19 testing sites, I encourage everyone, all of you to consider getting tested, getting the antibody test getting the nasal test. Let me tell you something here in New, York City, we're quite lucky to have the accessibility to test. As we do in other states, they don't have those same opportunities and to get their results as quickly as we're getting them. Please encourage those in the community to fill out the census. It only takes 10 minutes and it's in numerous languages. Currently our numbers in East, Somers and north corona are exceptionally low. Today, I sent the board members an event that the Queen's complete count is having every Friday or every other Friday we're doing phone banking, Friday so Carol. Although those residents in Queens on Wednesday I participated in the New York since new New, York, City census, foreign banking event and the court when we called over a thousand residents in East, Yonkers and North Corona, so please encourage those to fill out the census. We do not want our services to be impacted or our presentation. The Community Board has been very busy as continue we're still operating. Even if we're operating remotely we're having our meetings, the office is fully operational, we're in the process of doing the analysis for our website. We designed so we hope to have a new website up and running starting soon. The development, and hopefully by our towards the end of June, will be part way through our new website redevelopment, but also I like to mentioned. So, as you can see, the rate of return right now in Queens for the code for the census is 49%, but in our community in East Somers and north corona, as I mentioned before, it's pretty low the rates. So please encourage folks and when I do send you out information, I'm, hoping that you can volunteer your time. There's a lot of these phone banking events are virtual. Finally, congratulations to all of our 2020 graduates from elementary school high school and our college graduates. As you know, their ceremonies have been turned to visual virtual sorry, graduation ceremonies. A lot of those events like proms have been canceled, but please everyone. Please encourage our young people that there will be better days ahead in our future, where we can have the ability to celebrate their accomplishments with their family and friends. Again, a happy Mother's Day to all of our mothers. It was a few weeks ago, Cinco de Mayo, Ramadan, Memorial Day is coming up soon. So thank you to all of our those that served it's National, Bike Month mental health awareness month, Teacher, Appreciation, Week, Asian, Pacific, Islander, Heritage Month, and thank you to all of our nurses. The I do have a lot more information in your folder of events that are in the community, the commune's borough president's hosting a variety events. So please look in your folder and if you have any questions or concern, remember I'm always available. You can call me or email me. Does anyone have any questions or concerns miss Reed district managers report? Everyone I want to thank you for joining us once again on a virtual teleconference board meeting. I have to say we have an operating extremely well and I commend you for all that you are doing I want to say that the virus has had a very negative impact on our community and also personally, and so I want to thank all the all of our first line: workers, the police department, the fire department, EMS, the people who deliver our groceries, the MTA and so many others that don't come to mind and like at this point. We, by giving a round of applause to all of those that have helped us with help they do that. Can we please afford them just by saying thank you letting them know that we support them so I greatly. Thank you for helping me do that, but, as I mentioned there because of the virus, there are many changes that have occurred in the community, one being the Department homeless services. In order to come into compliance with social distinction, they are now trying to relocate. Many of the congregants in our five homeless shelters so that they're not crowded, so they have relocated some of the residents to the Holiday Inn. It is a temporary situation until the virus can get under better control. You say well, Holiday Inn is misery. Holiday Inn is on 37th Avenue and 114 Street in Corona, so the number of facilities has not increased. The number of residents has not increased. What they've done is to try to residents within a facility, so I want you to be made aware that as well. Some of the other changes that well not really related to the virus, but also while we are going wild, we are going through this crisis. The community is still under development. There are three new locations where construction is going to convince very shortly. All of them are residential and mixed-use. One is on 111 Street and Astoria Boulevard. Another is on Roosevelt Avenue and the third one is located on Northern Boulevard. Each of these facilities will not exceed facilities. Each of these residences will not exceed seven storeys. If you look at my district managers report, there are further details and in that report that will perhaps answer all of your questions. In addition, I'm gonna try to make my report brief, because you can refer to them again in my report. I, like also would like to take the opportunity, because I don't believe I did in the past couple of months, and that is, we've had a number of birthdays that we did not announce last time. So let me see if I can, in the month of April off the Taylor, I'm, sorry Arthur, Tyler and then Rosenbaum Esteban Peralta, abdul raheem, Hollander celebrated their birthday and the month of May twice, we celebrated her birthday in the month of May to a Washington Simon's coming very shortly. Mr. another English will also be celebrating her birthday, so I think we are currently we are up to date now and in terms of birthdays. March. Okay, can you see the March birthdays? Please Jimmy Smith Loretta, Richard, mink and Chanel Thomas birthdays, sweet sorry, so I also just want to thank all the members of the board for your cards and cools and condolence for my brother I was going to show you the plant that I received, but I don't have, and I will do that a little time again, I'm very grateful for your support and, as I always say, I'm very proud to be your district manager, and this is a best board in the city of New York and with that I think you would have a wonderful evening. Thank you, miss Reed. Thank you, make a motion for the adoption of our April 16 20 minutes. Second in favor, and we have some committee reports. I know that Anna's on the line that Airport committee but I know build me and attended that particular meeting. So do you want to say anything and hi I don't have anything to report at this time. Okay, so business echo, we already went education so Lisa and Laverne. Yes, we had a brief meeting earlier this month that we took many of the issues that are occurring with the with the school. Well, the school closing and the school's the education online and I had the opportunity to meet with the group of my colleagues who are still working and I had a chance to ask them questions and it's a really very serious matter. The children are not able to get online because the broadband services they don't have the connections t-mobile. They received a lot of their I pants from t-mobile and they keep getting locked off our students and they can't get back on and it's happening. Teachers never received equipment. So teachers who did not have equipment, find themselves going to relatives neighbors how someone else's house to use computers because they do not have, and they were never given, computers to use as well at home, and many of them have outdated laptops. There are no special and they're no special need services for our children. Now they're just completely abandoned the special needs programs. It's not a concern. It's not a consistent effort for all of the schools. It's not a uniform, they do have a website, but it's not a uniformed standardized kind of curriculum or activity or follow-up or evaluations for what's going on out there with all of our schools and all of our services, so that the schools are really winging it. To be very honest with you, and so is the entire system. Attendance is extremely low as it was reported by the mayor, and this is across the city. So we are just really struggling to keep up and keep. You know, keep focused with the needs of our families and our students out there. So we're just going to continue the effort, asking questions, sending out information, sending out questionnaires and letters to principals and to parent coordinators to find out how we as a board, can support and assist and just make note just make known what the needs are for our children here in the city of New York. Do you have anything to add Lisa now I was gonna, say that about the letters and also that miss any kind of questions that we have. We give to miss Reed, because you know she also passes it on and she meets with the who does who do you meet with miss Reed? We have daily briefings with these city agencies, including the mayor's office. Okay. So, if there's anything that you have concerns with you, let us know too, but, as dr. Laverne said, that we reaching out to the principals and parent coordinators of every school in our community board all right. Thank you, Lisa and one thing that I like about the board and I really thank all of you members. Our committee chairs they're dedicated, and we are still meeting even if we're meeting virtually, we are still meeting and you will be hearing some more from your other committee chairs in regards to future meetings. All right committee, refroze borough, presidents report, Lisa Atkins she's on the phone here. Let me just make sure Lisa good evening. Everyone Thank You, Lunetta, hello, all to all my friends and neighbors, are so good to see you even though I'm not seeing me right this moment, but it is an unprecedented time for all of us, as we are painfully aware and but at Borough. Hall I just want to assure you all this under acting borough. President Lee, we hit the ground running, even though we are at our homes and working remotely. Our office is open and active. As you may be aware, we were having job fairs and we're doing but being the front line and addressing our food insecurities around the boroughs. We've had some wonderful cooperation and corporate partners who have jumped in like Fresh, Direct and Council for airport opportunities. The Port, Authority and IKEA I mean I can go on and on because not only are we trying to take care of our individual household, we're also trying to enrich and support our frontline, and they are so overwhelmed and working hard every day. So we have to keep our families hold, as well as those who are supporting us to keep those families in the best health and best condition possible. Our Fresh Direct operations have started as a one-month opportunity. It is a happy to say that it's now being continued through July and the possibilities of moving forward beyond that. So there is lots to be had. We just had a job fair last week, there's a cooperation of airport opportunities. There will be another one coming, unfortunately, I don't have a confirmed date, but we will send out announcement shortly and I want to rate the chairperson is comment about our need. If nothing else, the conditions that we're undergoing reflects how important it is for each and every one of us to get 10 and 12 people that you know to make sure that they enroll in the census. The count is vitally important to our public needs and show that we Queens the largest bowl in the city of New York by land are also the strongest in our community. The numbers are showing for the one three six, eight one 369 tip codes in the lower deem of city, so we have to bring those numbers up. So please, each one of us give ten people and make sure that they do it online. It takes exactly three minutes to get it done. Three minutes is nothing we are at home. We can do this equally, that life to bring or remind everyone that we have some important elections coming up on June 23rd, and we need to make sure that we stand and be counted, and each vote does absolutely count on in this unprecedented time. I think, as the governor said, we need to be is mindful of that process as possible and as safe in that process as possible. It can be done by casting your vote online. You can't excusing that's the boat online, but you can cast your request for an absentee ballot and check off temporary illness for the pandemic. That is an option and you will automatically be enrolled if you do it online or applications or going out and I. That will take a little bit longer for you to receive and return, but if you can do it online by all means, do it and then you will be connected and application e ballots will go out to you directly. This is you know, standing up being counted and casting your votes are being counted is by far the best reflection of how our community is responding and paying attention to our public needs. Thank you so much Lisa, okay and god bless you all and be well. Thank you and board members. We did share in your folder information related to getting up the application for the absentee ballot. So please, as Lisa said, we encourage you to do that. I have sent in mine, so I encourage you to do the same cuban. Are you on the line? I guess she's off the line? Jacqueline Rosado hi. Can you hear me? Yes, I can all right great? Well, hello! For those of you don't know me. My name is Jacqueline I'm here on behalf of New York, State, Senator, Jessica, Ramos and, first and foremost, I just want to acknowledge Queens community board once again for the phenomenal leadership that you have exemplified throughout this time our office has been active and we've been responsive to the needs brought to our attention by residents within the community. As many of us know, our neighborhoods continue to be devastated by this pandemic, so we are in the course of navigating several ongoing initiatives both to meet the needs of the moment, but also to strategize for long-term relief that will apply throughout the New York pause period and beyond, and the way that we're doing it is we're focus ly we're focusing primarily on safeguarding those who are susceptible to the extreme food insecurity and concerns where we're seen in our neighborhoods. In addition to that there look, there are a lot of concerns about inadequate workforce protections that were seen so we've initiated a number of events and access points for these issues giving an example. Our office has begun a series of weekly Saturday, fresh produce and hot meal distributions to New York families. In need of food access justice we distributed close to the 40,000 pounds of fresh produce and served nearly 2,000 hot meals, these past few weeks through our upstate downstate farm partnership and local food vendor cooperation. Of course, these initiatives are fueled by working with local community-based organizations and nonprofits and centers I did see Tom here from the Queen's Chamber of Commerce. Oh, we definitely want to give him a shout out for the phenomenal leadership and the collaboration that he's given us throughout this time, and we really don't want to thank the leadership of the Community Board, because many members on this board helped refer those in need of groceries and hot meals to our office, and so they helped them reach the access that they need. So we're always very appreciative for that. As always, if there's anyone who knows someone who is in need of food access, please let us know you can reach me directly at Rosato at NY senate.gov and I'm gonna go ahead and put in the chat as well. We are launching other initiatives on the state level for a lot of legislative action. Items among those are our mark-to-market worker bailout fund. So we are aware there are a lot of vulnerable groups in our community who are not being serviced and not being are not being provided any relief through the safety net, that's being provided to a lot of our workforce. So we are introducing legislation to provide a worker bailout fund that will be the first in its kind throughout the nation, and it is the first bill in the country to tax billionaires annual increases in wealth as income. We are also introducing legislation to expand the definition of what it means to be an essential worker, because we know that there are a lot of workers in our district who don't qualify for a lot of the benefits that they deserve and because they've always been essential. In addition to that, we are also putting forth an employee notification of emergency Public Health contamination bill, which requires employers to notify workers in their own native language, when an employee's has positive for a virus to help inform the workforce workplace and to contain the health emergency as best as possible. We are open and we are here for the community for whatever issue that arises, feel free to contact me via email. Again, that's gonna be risotto at NY, Senate, gov and I'm gonna go ahead and put in the chat as well. Thank you so much Jacqueline and thank you for the wonderful work. I know many in the community appreciated all the food that they received. Jorge from Dan Decker's office hi good evening. Everybody I'll try to be as brief as possible. Our office has been very busy with various things. First of all, most importantly, helping constituents access unemployment, insurance and pandemic unemployment assistance. We are continuing to do that so far. We've helped at least a hundred people that numbers probably higher than ourselves as of last week, get their unemployment benefit. That number is probably gonna go higher next week and we hope they also get whole queue of people who are also waiting for the Department of Labor to get back to them as well, and we are urging anybody who needs help to reach out to us, because we are willing to inquire with Department of Labor on their behalf.

So if there's anybody in need of anything, we have a number of supplies, we're running low on hand sanitizer, which we have some. We have a decent amount of masks, so we're happy to assist and provide those items. In addition, I think everyone knows what the testing site that's currently being run at Woodside houses.

This is Michelle Hernandez from the office of Congress in Minooka, so Cortes community update tonight we hosted our monthly Town Hall for the month of May. I was happened right before on this meeting. The congresswoman was joined by the assistant commissioner at the mayor's office to end domestic and gender-based violence, as well as the commissioner of the New York City. Department of Sanitation and ich Ovid nineteen foods are I was a fruitful conversation and they were able to answer a handful of different questions that came in regards to the current response from constituents and so overall great event. I know a few of you were able to attend and ask questions and the legislative end. Do you want to announce an overview of the recently passed in the house? Heroes Act, which was voted on May 15th and, as I mentioned past the house, and it is a three trillion dollar legislative package designed to provide financial relief to communities and families that Act includes a hundred and seventy-five billion in renting and housing assistance, as well as funds to reduce incarceration and financial relief for our immigrant community and then probably one of the most critical portions of the bill is the funding that's being allocated to state and local entities and particularly in our case New York and the congresswoman. It also introduced a bill that would provide up to ten thousand dollars to cover a funeral expenses to those who have lost loved ones due to kovat 19. For our week, our office is still putting out weekly kovat 19e newsletters they're, both in English and in Spanish, and so, if you're interested in receiving updates around what our office is doing, what the federal government is doing a response to the pandemic. A please sign up, I can add a link into the text box and then chairwoman English did mention that East Ellmers in Corona is reporting on the lower end for the 2020 census. It's actually they're reporting right now around 30%, which is almost 30 points below the national average, and so, if you are checking in with friends loved ones that live in the area, encourage them to look at applying to the census. I love the phone banking idea. We have to get out the vote, because getting counted is now more important than ever as we're thinking about what relief will look like not only in the short term, but also in the long term as we respond to this pandemic and, lastly, just reminding everyone that why we are not in office.

Also, councilmember Moyer was the first to call for an emergency burial fun.

Now the mayor had offered opened up 22 million emergency funds to cover all low-income, New Yorkers, regardless of immigration status. The cost can be very expensive and now there's an increase in reimbursement for up to thirty four hundred dollars, and that includes cremation also. The councilmember passed his legislation to cap the course that third-party food delivery apps can charge businesses for delivery capped at fifteen percent, where they used to charge up toward thirty five percent.

The de Blasio had passed an executive order regarding mass and everything in certain communities are not getting their allocated amount really a mystery to me.

You know, like you, pass them executive orders that you have to do something and people fiscally don't have it or they don't.
