So on May 1st, as I mentioned previously, the first round of open streets were announced, as part of this announcement do t, send every community board and local elected official and Queens and email with the basic requirements for the open streets program, along with a forum link to collect them to collect recommendations.

If, the community board has any specific corridors or any businesses that they want to connect us with.
To start that conversation in an effort to begin this dialogue before the next round of open streets is open, because we want to actually work with business news and community boards to have a commercial corridors entered into the next round.
