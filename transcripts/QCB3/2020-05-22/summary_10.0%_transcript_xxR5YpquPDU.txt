We know that we are in the heart of the pandemic in the city, we've lost any number of friends and neighbors to this disease and have extraordinarily high numbers of people who are tested positive, and so that is continues to be.
They open up six to seven hundred people a day coming in we've been partnering with the board presidents office who's helped us bring Fresh Direct to some of those sites and to some of the communities and particularly trying to make sure that Homebound seniors get the kind of service they need.
We provided some halal meals along with the borough president at Elmhurst Hospital, on to thank workers there, as well as Uber cards, that we've been able to distribute to the people who are doing the hardest work, trying to make sure that our community has as much as it needs in this time of need.
My real hope is that there is a vaccine end or a cure found as soon as possible, because it's hard for me to imagine that we're going to be able to return to any normalcy until those things happen, particularly in communities as dense as ours and in a city as best as our unlike other parts of the state, which you know have lots of space and few people.
We only bring one person a day in the office other than myself, and we've received a lot of calls, particularly about unemployment insurance, which has been overloaded because of the number of people demanding those services.

All right, This is commute Queens Community board three in New, York, City.
You shout out to Detective Johnson, as well as my colleague, brother from another mother, John O'neil who's, your borough planner for you or your night, to talk to you a little bit more about the open streets, program, so I'm just going to ask everybody to hold off on any questions I appreciate that this is the first time I'm using this one.
The city has never rolled out a program like this before so we're open to making adjustments as needed Currently working with community boards to fine- tune this process as we go along with the ultimate goal of reach: 100 miles, we heard loud and clear from community before 3.
Do T is working closely with local precinct to support this program, but as we continue to roll out more open streets, we hope to reach unity.
Duration of closure will be determined in partnership with New York City, Do T and the NYPD Proposing organizations must have a strong tie to the community and demonstrate their capacity to manage open streets by providing a staffing.
So on May 1st, as I mentioned previously, the first round of open streets were announced, as part of this announcement do t, send every community board and local elected official and Queens and email with the basic requirements for the open streets.
A slide of the open streets website on our web page I just wanted to also give you a sense of what this site looks like here.
I want to also just provide you guys with some general overview of what we have right now currently for open streets within the borough.
The largest announcement of open streets and Queens happened recently actually last week of the 3rd round and that's when we expanded 34th Avenue from 7 Th Street to also include 7, E, Street and Junction Boulevard now hunter miles sounds like a lot, but just keeping in mind that we have 6,000 miles of streets in New, York, City.
With regards to open streets, I want to show you guys some photos, 34Th Avenue, here's some snapshots that were taken over the last several days and over the weekend we pulled some of these from our site.
Last week before after we rolled out the expansion of 115 of 34th Avenue, we spoke with 115th about their strategy for 34th and they shared with us the community that the community affairs officers are recruited volunteers from the neighborhood and allowed them to take a lead in setting up barriers and as well as taking them down throughout the day.
One of the things I just wanted to enter right here is that 34Th Avenue has become the most popular Street in the city of New York when it comes to open, streets.
The city has never rolled out a program like this before and we're open to making adjustments as needed If something's, not working, we're, certainly up to making those adjustments and or removing areas we're looking also for equitable distribution of locations.
We want to help in any way to make those adjustments in communication with local precincts As deputy inspector I've made me aware.
With regards to your second question, which is a really great question- This is something that John and I are really excited and embarking on- is working with businesses to expand an open street to commercial corners in an effort to facilitate businesses.
To start that conversation in an effort to begin this dialogue before the next round of open streets is open, because we want to actually work with business news and community boards to have a commercial corridors entered into the next round.
If you guys had hear anything or see any issues with Mr. Softee or any other trucks that are flouting the open street over here, please let us know we can reach out I'm out and about so.
Thanks Jason, for working with the community to open up 34th Avenue from 69th to Junction.
You can also read it just says some of the open streets are crowded like by Travis Park, and it might help if folks follow traffic.
How much community groups are involved with involved with maintaining and monitoring the open street on 34th Avenue?
Sometimes people just like to throw things in the street and with alternate side of the street parking being suspended for as long as it has been just wanted to know what efforts are.
Why the other day and John, who runs the lead and keeping in touch with us, and why we'll continue to monitor with myself, too Avenue, open streets coalition has an abundance of volunteers and they working with over 10 community groups to volunteer Martha Jason, I agree with Lorinda 114Th Street needs to be looked at separately, because that area is highly trafficking and we have issues with the traffic and Martha The community gourd would definitely like to be part of that conversation, as he mentioned that we should all be working together.
Also, look ahead, Marty good again, oh, but we do all need to be part of that conversation, because once this is over- And you know, there's a little more traffic I'm, seeing a lot more traffic on Roosevelt Avenue I have construction sites going on.
Just like we all our data, day- Yet, that's what's going on with this program, so you know this constant conversation and this dialogue is actually very valuable and we want to keep maintaining it with you.
These are resources that are going to be allocated out into communities throughout the city to have conversations with folks who are not social, distancing.
Not only will you have you know the NYPD upset D- Is there going to be a dedicated line, so our residents can call up and get somebody to answer that phone that we have a problem well depending on the problem, is an emergency that you always call 9, 1- 1, but on most of the volunteers in the area have a lot of straight open line of communication.
Are always out there talking people making sure everybody I'm abides by the rules as much as possible, but we'll keep looking into it, but I think the program is working, great.
The final, everyone I want to thank Jason, do T and the 115th precinct for coming out and speaking on the issue of open streets.
T things and Queens I wanted to just thank the community board three for allowing me to come and present This, July and I.

Unfortunately, the ones I mentioned that are in the most distressed, restaurants, are the most susceptible I was asked to be in the mayor's committee for small business with a bunch of other folks and the notion of a light switch where businesses would open and people would flock to them is probably far off the other notion of having restaurants, open at say, 50% capacity or even 75%, With.
