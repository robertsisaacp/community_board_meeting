Anytime, They open up six to seven hundred people a day coming in we've been partnering with the board presidents office who's helped us bring Fresh Direct to some of those sites and to some of the communities and particularly trying to make sure that homebound seniors get the kind of service they need.
My real hope is that there is a vaccine end or a cure found as soon as possible, because it's hard for me to imagine that we're going to be able to return to any normalcy until those things happen, particularly in communities as dense as ours and in a city as best as our unlike other parts of the state, which you know have lots of space and few people We have a lot of people in very little space, so I'm, hoping that will happen.
The cooperation of the people of this community has been great and I hope that, as you do your work at support as it is that those messages you're taking out, certainly for those who are in the thirty-fifth Please let me know we certainly have masks available as we speak, so that if there are places when you want to distribute mass on your block, please call your office that one eight four five, seven three six one five as well as for any other assistance that we can give you six feet away, mask and wash your hands as often as you can that's right, and thanks for mentioning about the pantry's and board members folder local food pantries that are there please share with those in the community and we do have the ones that you mentioned.
Give me one second: Everybody good evening: community board 3 before I get into it , You shout out to Detective Johnson as well as my colleague, brother from another mother, John O'neil who's, your borough planner for you or your night to talk to you a little bit more about the open streets program They can put it in the chat area.
The city has never rolled out a program like this before so we're open to making adjustments as needed, and we're currently working with community boards to fine-tune this process as we go along with the ultimate goal of reach 100 miles, we heard loud and clear from community before 3 we want to be in, but that they want to be involved more, and we thank you to giovanna Renetta for inviting us here to discuss the process and provide more background on some of the success we've seen so far.
Currently in Queens Do T is working closely with local precinct to support this program, but as we continue to roll out more open streets, we hope to reach unity partners such as bids local volunteers, block associations that can help us with implementation.
This is actually a link to our survey and just gives you a little look at what we have currently right now available on our online portal, we're actively connecting collecting recommendations for feasibility and safety before being approved for the next rollout We sent this forum link to the community boards all electives and do to partners with the intention that it would be shared with the public read the word after this presentation.
The largest announcement of open streets and Queens happened recently actually last week of the 3rd round and that's when we expanded 34th Avenue from 7 th Street to also include 7, E, Street and junction Boulevard If we do achieve 100 miles, that's only one point: six miles of city streets that will be used for pedestrians and cyclists with regards to open streets I want to show you guys some photos, 34th Avenue, here's some snapshots that were taken over the last several days and over the weekend we pulled some of these from our site visits and we'll talk a little bit about that success.
Avenue is an open street from 69th Street down to junction Boulevard One of the things I just wanted to enter right here when it comes to open streets, The type of activity that we're seeing there, along with the partnership between the 115th and our community partners, who are out there every single day, is something that we're actually now trying to emulate.
The city has never rolled out a program like this before and we're open to making adjustments as needed if something's not working, we're, certainly up to making those adjustments and or removing areas we're looking also for equitable distribution of locations across the borough, as well as in community, bore three cuz right now.
Thanks Jason for working with the community to open up 34th Avenue from 69th to Junction You know we're actively talking with the precinct about expanding, but there are some concerns with expanding that area that has GCP access and there's also access from the east to get to junction, which is a major commercial corridor.
The high volume of traffic individuals will soon probably go out and try and sell food and unfortunately, everyone, sometimes people just like to throw things in the street and with alternate side of the street parking being suspended for as long as it has been just wanted to know what efforts are we gave it to.
We sent that actually to Giavanna on Tuesday after we did a presentation for all borough boards, but that's also another concern for us when we had the open streets when we announced the second round, why we had a conversation about open streets with DSM Avenue, open streets coalition has an abundance of volunteers and they working with over 10 community groups to volunteer Go ahead.
Also look ahead, Marty good again, oh, but we do all need to be part of that conversation, because once this is over-- and you know, there's a little more traffic I'm seeing a lot more traffic on Roosevelt Avenue I have to go out and clean every day, because I don't see things being cleaned and people are throwing everything into the streets and on the sidewalks from the mass to the gloves to everything So, we need to be part of the conversation with the traffic over there, as well as in other parts of our community.
Folks, Another good thing to mention is the mayor had mentioned the other day, the group of an ambassador program, some of our DoD colleagues, are participating in this That's, going to be added to open streets Is there going to be a dedicated line, so our residents can call up and get somebody to answer that phone that we have a problem well depending on the problem, is an emergency that you always call 9-1-1, but on most of the volunteers in the area have a lot of straight open line of communication without with Adrian and Mario and again you can always call 3-1-1 we're always monitoring it.
The NCOs are always out there talking people making sure everybody The final everyone I want to thank Jason, do T and the 115th precinct for coming out and speaking on the issue of open streets So, a traffic transportation committee meeting is warranted, so Jason and John will be getting back to you without the date that our committee meeting will be held.
T things and Queens I wanted to just thank the community board three for allowing me to come and present There We've never been in a situation like this before in the history of our country, our city, our state, but I just want you to feel at least some sense of relief, We've been around since 1911, and we've been talking about advocacy networking in education since day, one we're currently located we're neighbors in East Elmhurst Jackson Heights in the Bulova Corporate Center, which you folks probably all know it's a great location, We just added more space about six months ago and where we've been growing by leaps and bounds, we represent one hundred and eleven hundred and fifty members representing over a hundred thousand Queens based employees.
