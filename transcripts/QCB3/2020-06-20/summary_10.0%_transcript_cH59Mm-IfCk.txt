You did a great job great mr Chowdhury Here new law, doherty Michael just arrived I'm chair of Queens community for a number like to welcome you to our since March 18 There's, some people there Following our agenda.
Old I was actually fired from my very first job at a local pizzeria, because I was too gay to work behind the counter, and that wasn't the last time I was fired for being gay There were several instances throughout my life, where I was fired from jobs for being too effeminate to gay, and now that's illegal I've been asked by a number of different people in the this past week, who said I'm surprised that still even existed, that you could fire someone for being gay or transgender or lesbian or whatnot So it's miss Lopez from Fuentes community translators, service here and I am the proud Queens residents.
Oh yeah, basically started this community project this year in order to develop an opportunity for young bilingual adults in our community to be connected to professional opportunities in translation We all know that our borough is the most diverse in the whole world, the most languages, and there are a lot of community organizations that need help with translation, to be able to reach a broader audience here, I'm hoping to launch a summer internship for young students that would like to get experience as professional translators, and so we are looking for I'm looking for support from community with three different things, so one any community orgs that would like to partner with us to any high school students or young adults under the age of 24.
Puentes is just means bridge in spanish, so we're hoping to build a lot more bridges and improve language access in our community again critical profess Puentes translators, comm I, wish I could send you all business cards, but best I can do is just show you our little logo and if anyone would like to, hopefully they will encourage you to think about joining your organization or providing the volunteer services if you type it in the chat box.
Let me know if you would like to partner I, would love to provide this for the youth in our community to do something good this summer, She wanted to discuss open streets, but she's, not here Next on our agenda is public information is Missal Melinda Katz on the Queens da No, do I see myself hold on a second someone So you can see our Queens District Attorney as she gives a presentation.
and I saw this coming way before, the public would have realized it because we were losing grand jurors We figured out a system where people can videoconference in We figured out how to do our discovery by videoconference, and so there was a lot of organization that went into making sure that a 700 person office could actually work and be effective.
People are home, they are trapped, they have no access to a phone, they are by a computer where their abusers are The. Police department is doing everything they can I believe to protect victims of domestic violence and past abuses, and they usually would go to someone's house once a week that they knew were past victims during this pandemic The meantime we have advocated on the state legislative side to get rid of the loitering law in Albany We will not prosecute for it, and we have advocated to the state legislature to recall that law shootings have gone up in the borough of Queens County, much driven by Queens, south We have developed A violent criminal enterprise, Bureau This, is the Bureau who is going out to the community to make sure that if you are a gun, trafficker and you come to this borough- to sell guns, especially to our young people, that we are going to have a bureau that is going to come after you.
Yes, I wondered if the district attorney could elaborate on the new Bureau that will address housing and homeowner issues So you know, I was the borough president for six years, as many of you know, and I worked for borough, President Shulman, one of the things we found kept coming up time and time again was predatory lending people that bought other folks homes In the contract.
The problem you have right now is that there's no help for anyone is going through these types of issues, so you can't put them in a workforce development program because they're stealing, you know the mirrors because they can't get a job The new law is to take into account recidivists that continue to steal and we're just basically, you know traveling through the system like just going revolving system, and so we should have a little more power.
So you could do a little bit so to be exact just because I summarized before there is a thirty seven point, three percent year-to-date North Koreans high in shootings in the county of Queens South My vc0, which is violent criminal enterprise, Bureau There is a gang that we are heading getting to the heads of these gangs, because if you don't and you just get the shooters or you just get the gang members, other gangs, as we all know, other people just take the place We need to dismantle the gun traffickers, while still making sure that we're working with our young people, especially to limit the market and to limit the desire they have for guns and You, know I believe that if we get the traffickers, where we don't limit the market, that we don't have these programs to make sure that people aren't making the market for the guns, it's only one prong Yet I, don't know where the state is moving towards, where you can't seal them.
Thank you for the invitation to come by and say hello, I know, I don't come to the community boards I see dr Collins, the president-elect of the so at a New York State Chapter of the association of black psychologists, very good, to see you, of course, back in Queens and you'll be hearing from her shortly and her expertise, and she certainly has a tremendous amount of expertise and also vision for her organization and how it may serve all of New York State, but in particular in Queens, but as the DA mentioned census.
In a borough like Queens, we are the most diverse County in the continental US in a particular bar three one of the most diverse boards community districts It's there's been a lot going on in Queens , The reopening has been a bit of a moving target for certainly the downstate region, including Queens County, just because we were the UH, the unenviable marker being the epicenter of the epicenter of the pandemic We do know that it's a race against time, but also that having it at the expense of lost lives or losing lives is not an option for us here in New, York, and so all hands are on deck, In addition to the census and the election on the reopening, and certainly on this resurgence in the call and the demand and the urgency of Hertford for justice or for the affirmation of black lives.
Now, with this community board talking about what our strengths are and what our challenges are just having, the dialogues are so important, and these kinds of conversations can help us to discover our shared values, because, even though we might come from different places have different customs, we can find that we have some shared values and shared goals, things that we all want, and it's really important to get on the same page about that We need to identify what resources and strengths we have and, along with that, reflect on areas that might need strengthening and talk about how we can strengthen the things like that, need that it's also important to discuss responsibility, and that means identifying community leaders, agencies and organizations and learning what their role is, what they are doing, what they're supposed to be doing and talking about how to hold people accountable, but the things that they have been called to do so , there's a lot that can be gained from building community and joining together in solidarity With the dialogue, see what you have in common see, what your strengths are continue to attend this and other community meetings encourage others to come.
And, yes, it's very important that we all do come together and that's the one thing that I love about Queens community board number three So, we'll move on to our public hearings: Edmund Rosenbaum, our business echo remember, is the m1 What we're going to do is we're going to move on to the mayor's office Let my colleague, and about Palma, go first That's okay from testing trace I'm community board three for allowing us to come before you today.
In this capacity I am working with a dynamic team of individuals focused on that we can get New, York City back a safe and healthy place, and so we know that we've heard a lot about what's going on with this pandemic, and we wanted to make sure that, as far as the test and trace corpse that one of the key components of our program is to make sure that folks are interested.
Our mission is, like I, said, to exam to be village in testing tool to make sure that we're tracing and they were supporting communities by offering places where they can safely separate, should they need to from their families and we're doing that by offering hotels at the interface want of reopening your city, we need the help of our community members.
Wwsz gov slash called the test or by calling three one directive to testify in your community You know the test and trace course is here to help every single New Yorker We want to make sure again that we are reaching everything that we can specially in those communities that were mostly affected by this by this pandemic and we're doing that by offering the free testing by making sure than anyone with the virus And anyone who chooses who need to isolate can do so safely to prevent to prevent the spread.
So this morning was signed an executive order by the mayor, putting into action open restaurants, and this program is expected to save 5,000 restaurants and 45,000 jobs, It's going to create a new and streamlined application process to allow restaurants to expand capacity outdoors so restaurants at any bars cafes that serve food, will have five options to mix and match between curb Lane seating, that's being piloted through Labor Day sidewalk seating, which is going through the end of October backyard and patio seating, which will be ongoing, open street seating, which will go nights and weekends beginning in July, and then bid that manage pedestrian plazas will work with d-o-t to help restaurant set up seating So. These application sort of the application for this program will be live tomorrow morning for establishments to self-certify and there's no additional needed application with the State Liquor Authority The application can be found at nycgov, slash, open, restaurants, We encourage all restaurants that well, if I meet those criteria to apply for a self-certification tomorrow morning, SVS that the Small Business Services has been working to distribute 2 million face mass citywide and with the start of phase 2, they will be distributing an additional 2 million to small business and their employees in community board.
The rent guidelines board voted last night to approve a proposal that rents will be frozen for one year leases and for the first year of two-year leases during the second year of two year, leases landlords can only bump the rent by one percent and these changes will be going into effect from October 1st lasting until September 2021 mayor have been advocating for a rent freeze for months in order to make sure that we're helping these 2 million New Yorkers, who live in about a million rent, stabilized apartments and an answer to the questions that were posed earlier.
I can email the community boards and guidance that I have there The one that we got in Queens is in Jackson Heights, but there are a lot of different resources coming to the hardest-hit areas of Queens.
Anything like that The other previous months of from April to May was very high, but we made some good arrests and that's come back down and now that businesses are starting to open back up No right, there were some rumors, but on thankfully the community was very peaceful This is a Margaret Flanagan police officer.
The persistent homeless camps and the BQE underpasses and I've been informed that jurisdictionally, that is more than 108 precinct, but the people are not encampments Come in to our precinct, where there's lots of public urination public drinking public defecation, like the mess on the streets on the side of our precinct, is very great, so I'd love to ask for your officers to do a little bit more patrolling on our blocks and for Yes, no I'm, very aware of that situation, and it's it's tough, because we set about an operation would say breaking ground and we'll see the homeless out there.
I think this is the second time lost race, which was there prior finally lost their liquor, license and moved out so he's assuming the business but he's coming to the community board saying he doesn't want it he's opening a bar in a tavern he's, not opening a restaurant and then gonna turn it into a nightclub.
So then we'll move on to the second half okay, late good evening community for three were here again: we were last week name when against on the community board and we're an active family that we own a business on 82 13 in 211, and the reason for us applying for liquor license next door is because the department requiring us to get a public assembly which that our it's gonna be a very expensive way to go.
