I'm, chair of Queens community, for a number like to welcome you to our since March 18 There's, some people there.
Secretary Panetta, asked me to say a few words about the recent Supreme Court decision regarding the Lgbtq+ community, now being protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and it's great that it coincides with June, which most of you hold on I'm, getting a lot of feedback.
So, and it's great that it coincides with June, which most of you know is Gay. This act by the Supreme Court is especially important as it is one more step for the Lgbtq+ community, which is my community in our fight for full equal rights in this country.
We all know that our borough is the most diverse in the whole world, the most languages, and there are a lot of community organizations that need help with translation, to be able to reach a broader audience here.
Let me know if you would like to partner I, would love to provide this for the youth in our community to do something good.
She wanted to discuss open streets, but she's, not here Next on our agenda is public information is Missal Melinda Katz on the Queens Da No, do I, see myself hold on a second someone, So you can see our Queens District Attorney as she gives a presentation.
We figured out how to do our discovery by videoconference, and so there was a lot of organization that went into making sure that a 700 person office could actually work and be effective.
At the same time, though, we're working toward social programs to make sure the young people are places to go, that there is no market for guns so that we get cured violence, groups and drug rehabilitation, programs and workforce development programs as part of the DA's office, which it has not been in the past.
As many of you know, And I worked for borough,, President Shulman, one of the things we found kept coming up time and time again was predatory lending people that bought other folks homes.
And we're in the process now of doing it or forming a hotline so that if we can see a trend, that's going on in one community where someone is trying to buy out houses, and we can see that that's happening, and they do that in order to disrupt the fiber of a neighborhood, so that people sell easier so that we had a hotline to keep track of those cases to make sure that we can actually get to those who are trying to disturb the neighborhoods.
Right now is that there's no help for anyone is going through these types of issues, so you can't put them in a workforce development program because they're stealing , you know the mirrors because they can't get a job And, so we're working towards that.
You know traveling through the system like just going revolving system, And, so we should have a little more power, but what's going to really change the game is when we get rid of the bill and put a lot of more of these supervised release programs in place, so someone gets arrested.

Their goal, is to find the traffickers of these guns and also to find the gang members, and we want to make sure that we get to the top right There is a gang that we are heading getting to the heads of these gangs, because if you do not- You just get the gang members, other gangs, as we all know, other people just take the place.
We need to dismantle the gun traffickers, while still making sure that we're working with our young people, especially to limit the market and to limit the desire they have for guns and You, know I believe that if we get the traffickers, where we do not limit the market, that we do not have these programs to make sure that people are not making the market for the guns, it's only one prong and we're not going to be able to solve the issue.
I'd also like to thank Miss Melton from your office who participated earlier in the year in our human trafficking forum, and she was very informative.
You like to welcome our Queens borough, president Sharon Lee. She has done a phenomenal job since January And she's been receptive to Queens Community board number three, and we appreciate the relationship that we built over the last few months, Green's row: President Lee, good evening.

Excuse, me, I, think my connection is okay, so when I am when a community is facing a massive trauma such as you know, the effects of Koba, 19 or racial violence, there's often a shared emotional bond amongst people in the community and that's a powerful thing if you heard that collective trauma hurts, but on the other hand, that shared experience of shared thoughts and feelings mean that I mean they mean that nobody is alone.
During crises like the one where the several crises were experiencing now, feelings of stress, hopelessness, confusion can sometimes turn people against each other, but on the other, hand, a crisis also provides an opportunity for coming together and that's really what I want to encourage everyone to do come together.
We need to identify what resources and strengths we have and, along with that, reflect on areas that might need strengthening and talk about how we can strengthen the things like that, need that it's also important to discuss responsibility, and that means identifying community leaders, agencies and organizations and learning what their role is, what they are doing.
What they're supposed to be doing and talking about how to hold people accountable, but the things that they have been called to do so , there's a lot that can be gained from building community and joining together in Solidarity With.
