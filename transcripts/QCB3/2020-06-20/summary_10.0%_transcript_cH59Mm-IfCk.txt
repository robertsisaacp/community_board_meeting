I'm, chair of Queens community, for a number like to welcome you to our since March 18 There's, some people there.
There were several instances throughout my life, where I was fired from jobs for being too effeminate to gay, and now that's illegal I've been asked by a number of different people in the this past week, who said, I'm surprised that still even existed, that you could fire someone for being gay or transgender or lesbian or whatnot So, ok, pride, all right!
We all know that our borough is the most diverse in the whole world, the most languages, and there are a lot of community organizations that need help with translation, to be able to reach a broader audience here.
Let me know if you would like to partner I, would love to provide this for the youth in our community to do something good.
We figured out how to do our discovery by videoconference, and so there was a lot of organization that went into making sure that a 700 person office could actually work and be effective.
We immediately send an ad a down to the site so that we are a large apart, a huge part of the investigation on what happened at the site, and that is a bureau that has been developed over the last month, and we want to make sure that if you have issues there, you really contact us, because this is extremely important for my administration.
This is the Bureau who is going out to the community to make sure that if you are a gun, trafficker and you come to this borough- to sell guns, especially to our young people, that we are going to have a bureau that is going to come after you.
At the same time, though, we're working toward social programs to make sure the young people are places to go, that there is no market for guns so that we get cured violence, groups and drug rehabilitation, programs and workforce development programs as part of the DA's office, which it has not been in the past.
And we're in the process now of doing it or forming a hotline so that if we can see a trend, that's going on in one community where someone is trying to buy out houses, and we can see that that's happening, and they do that in order to disrupt the fiber of a neighborhood, so that people sell easier so that we had a hotline to keep track of those cases to make sure that we can actually get to those who are trying to disturb the neighborhoods.
Right now is that there's no help for anyone is going through these types of issues, so you can't put them in a workforce development program because they're stealing, you know the minors, because they can't get a job And, so we're working towards that.
You know traveling through the system like just going revolving system, And, so we should have a little more power, but what's going to really change the game is when we get rid of the bill and put a lot of more of these supervised release programs in place, so someone gets arrested.
We need to dismantle the gun traffickers, while still making sure that we're working with our young people, especially to limit the market and to limit the desire they have for guns and You, know I.
I'd also like to thank miss Melton from your office who participated earlier in the year in our human trafficking forum, and she was very informative.
Collins, the president-elect of the so at a New York State Chapter of the association of black psychologists, very good, to see you, of course, back in Queens.
In a borough like Queens, we are the most diverse County in the continental US in a particular bar three one of the most diverse boards community, districts.
I would like ask President Lee of question that I'm afraid of a big homeless problem coming And I'm, just wondering what help is available safe for people.
We start seeing a lot of homeless people And, you know, for the benefit of the community.
Excuse, me, I, think my connection is okay, so when I am when a community is facing a massive trauma such as you know, the effects of Koba, 19 or racial violence, there's often a shared emotional bond amongst people in the community and that's a powerful thing.
During crises like the one where the several crises were experiencing now feelings of stress, hopelessness, confusion can sometimes turn people against each other, but on the other hand, a crisis also provides an opportunity for coming together and that's really what I want to encourage everyone to do.
We need to identify what resources and strengths we have and, along with that, reflect on areas that might need strengthening and talk about how we can strengthen the things like that, need that it's also important to discuss responsibility, and that means identifying community leaders, agencies and organizations and learning what their role is, what they are doing.
What they're supposed to be doing and talking about how to hold people accountable, but the things that they have been called to do so , there's a lot that can be gained from building community and joining together in solidarity.
Talk with each other start with the dialogue, see what you have in common see what your strengths are continue to attend this and other community meetings encourage others to come.
It's very important that we all do come together and that's the one thing that I love about Queens community board number three.
