My name is Renetta English I'm, chair of Queens community, for a number like to welcome you to our since March 18 and I'm happy to see a lot of our board. Members are on tonight. I know we had a little hiccups with the board. Folder I sent you the link a few minutes ago, where we have all of the documents section of our minutes and so on. So as Kevin explained, if we hear that we are going to mute everyone and we're only going to have your speaking and after the presenter is finished, then if you have any questions when it's time to ask questions, then we'll unmute, everyone but we'll see I won't trouble that, but we prefer, if you have any questions, please type it in the chat box and I do not end. There's some people there. That has time that began typing some items in there, but no. The folder is only for board members all right thanks Martha, if you can do that too, if you can respond to folks in the chat box, Kevin and I are busy doing other things. I appreciate that so as I'm not up. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you I'm. Following our agenda for today, there were two historic decisions made this week by the Supreme. Court Kevin will discuss one and if September, hopefully it will get a speaker to talk about daca, so Kevin public participation. You have three minutes: hi I'm, Kevin news, nabo, exactly the board. Secretary Panetta asked me to say a few words about the recent Supreme Court decision regarding the lgbtq+ community, now being protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and it's great that it coincides with June, which most of you hold on I'm, getting a lot of feedback, so I I'm, gonna mute everyone. Okay, all right! Sorry about that! So and it's great that it coincides with June, which most of you know is Gay Pride Month. This act by the Supreme Court is especially important as it is one more step for the lgbtq+ community, which is my community in our fight for full equal rights in this country. As an openly gay genderqueer man who came out in the early 90s in the Metro Detroit area of Michigan, when I was just about 16 years, old I was actually fired from my very first job at a local pizzeria, because I was too gay to work behind the counter and that wasn't the last time I was fired for being gay. There were several instances throughout my life where I was fired from jobs for being too effeminate to gay and now that's illegal I was actually I've been asked by a number of different people in the this past week, who said I'm surprised that still even existed, that you could fire someone for being gay or transgender or lesbian or whatnot and I said no more than half the country you were. You were allowed to fire someone for loving somebody that was different than what the norm had defined as has proper and so I'm, just so glad to be to be here to witness not just gays being allowed in the military, but marriage, equality and now equal rights under the Civil Rights Act. So, ok, pride all right! Thank you! So much Kevin and as mentioned we will have a speaker, hopefully in September, to discuss the changes in regards to daca and we're happy about hearing about that for this week. All right, so it's miss Lopez from Fuentes community translators service here. Can you unmute everyone, Kevin I'm, sure that's miss prentace. Are you here? Yes hi? Can everybody hear me? Yes, wonderful! Welcome, yes, can you hear me? Yes, we can yes, hi welcome everyone. Okay, great I, just turned on my camera as well hi everyone nice to meet you. My name is Christian Lopez and I am the proud Queens residents, then the founder of whiteness community translators. Here we go I'm gonna hold this up to the camera. Oh yeah basically started this community project this year in order to develop an opportunity for young bilingual adults in our community to be connected to professional opportunities in translation. So we all know that our borough is the most diverse in the whole world, the most languages, and there are a lot of community organizations that need help with translation, to be able to reach a broader audience here and there's also a lot of youth that are growing up bilingual here. So cuentas translators our program, I'm, hoping to launch a summer internship for young students that would like to get experience as professional translators, and so we are looking for I'm looking for support from community with three different things, so one any community orgs that would like to partner with us to any high school students or young adults under the age of 24. That would like to participate in our internship and three any bilingual volunteers that would like to help cuentas be successful this year. Obviously we didn't anticipate these. You know emergencies that we've been going through this year with coronavirus, so any help is really appreciated. And again my name is Christian Lopes I'm, the founder of this project and our website is www.pevs.com. Puentes is just means bridge in spanish, so we're hoping to build a lot more bridges and improve language access in our community. So that's why I'm here today, again critical profess Puentes translators, comm I, wish I could send you all business cards, but best I can do is just show you our little logo I watch and miss Lopez. You can type that information in the chat box and if anyone would like to hopefully they will encourage you to think about joining your organization or providing the volunteer services if you type it in the chat box. Please do that so that we can refer to that later on. I will do that right now. Thank you. Everybody, let me know if you would like to partner I, would love to provide this for the youth in our community to do something good this summer. Thank you, alright, thank you. So much Kevin can you unmute everybody. It's Karen! It's querida Labuan on Karen de la one, Dilla one Karen de la la', one all right, so I be going once going twice, will move on so Karen is not here. She wanted to discuss open streets, but she's, not here so we'll move on. So next on our agenda is public information is Missal. Melinda Katz on the Queens da I am hi. How are you doing? I am well. How are you missing? Woosh I'm? Fine. Thank you. Thank you for joining us today, new role, so we're excited to hear from you again. Congratulations and we're looking. Thank you very much now, I can't see. Can you see me if everyone clicks on talking say it again, so my screen says all camera spaces are currently being used. I can share a camera when someone stops sharing I, don't know what that means. I've never used this medium. Actually, I'll stop sharing. Okay! It's alright! Everybody see me! No, let's see you try again. No do I, see myself hold on a second someone, stop sharing their camera, so we should now become angry. Yes, how is everyone very good and if they'd like to see you can click on view who's talking everyone, so you can see our Queens District Attorney as she gives a presentation. So it's good to see everyone. Thank you! Miss English, thank you. Miss Reed I see our borough president Sharon Lee as well on this. What would its WebEx or order? This is I really wanted to come in and just say hello to everybody. I tell you a little bit about what's going on at the district attorney's office and also thank everyone for their support and for their friendships. All over the years. A lot of you are really old friends and by old friends, I mean years that we've known each other, and some of you are new friends, but we've known each other a long time and been through a lot of things together. So I've been the District Attorney. Now, for six months almost since I became the DA on January 1st, we have the bail laws twice. We have changed the discovery laws twice. We have a new administration and many new executives on staff. We have gotten rid of some very bad I thought and biased policies of the former administration. We have had a pandemic that we lived through so far and we've had a national movement for social justice, and now that we are 100% video conferencing at my office, we are going back to in-person, so it has been quite the few months at the DA's office, just a few things on what's going on. First of all, we are managing 100% by videoconference. It is amazing, so I saw you know. I've managed many offices in my career and I saw this coming way before the public would have realized it because we were losing grand jurors. So in March we started losing grand jurors almost every single day, and we knew it was from this disease, and so immediately we ordered computers. We figured out a system where people can videoconference in. We figured out how to do our discovery by videoconference, and so there was a lot of organization that went into making sure that a 700 person office could actually work and be effective during this pandemic. So we have been doing arraignments the only thing that's actually on site and has to be on-site, even though it's videoconferencing, because if something goes wrong, a defendant has a right to an arraignment within 24 hours. He can't be at home and the videos go off. You had to be right on site, we've done Skype arguments which were in front of the Appellate Division, so the system is still running. We've also developed a lot of new programs. We've developed a conviction, Integrity Unit, which has over 40 cases that it is investigating right now, because no one should be in jail who is innocent and we have a fresh set of eyes and paralegals and attorneys who are looking at applicants to the conviction, Integrity Unit. It is something I believe in very deeply and at the same time, we've developed a cold case unit because remember everyone who is in jail, who shouldn't be there who did not commit the crime? There is someone else out there who actually did and the families deserve closure. The families deserve to know who took their loved ones from them, but we also need to make sure that the conviction, Integrity Unit, is empowered and works very hard. We have the housing and worker Protection Bureau, so I want everyone to be really be a partner in this Bureau. This is a bureau that if you're an employee and you're being discriminated against or someone is acting in bad faith as an employer, someone is using your documentation, status against you and your place of business. Your landlord is using your documentation, status against you or they are discriminating or you work on a worksite for construction, and there is an accident. We immediately send an ad a down to the site so that we are a large apart, a huge part of the investigation on what happened at the site, and that is a bureau that has been developed over the last month, and we want to make sure that if you have issues there, you really contact us, because this is extremely important for my administration. We also want to make sure that everyone is aware of the fact that domestic violence during this pandemic is extremely underreported. People are home, they are trapped, they have no access to a phone, they are by a computer where their abusers are. The police department is doing everything they can I believe to protect victims of domestic violence and past abuses, and they usually would go to someone's house once a week that they knew were past victims during this pandemic. They use phones and they use any way they can but they're, not in the house. So you can't see it. So please check from loved ones that you know might be at risk for that. In the meantime, we have advocated on the state legislative side to get rid of the loitering law in Albany. I have now prosecuted anyone for loitering and that you know mostly, is loitering to do prostitution. We will not prosecute for it, and we have advocated to the state legislature to recall that law shootings have gone up in the borough of Queens County, much driven by Queens south. We have developed and I developed over the last few months, a violent criminal enterprise Bureau. This is the bureau. That's going to get the gangs. This is the Bureau who is going out to the community to make sure that if you are a gun, trafficker and you come to this borough- to sell guns, especially to our young people, that we are going to have a bureau that is going to come after you. At the same time, though, we're working toward social programs to make sure the young people are places to go, that there is no market for guns so that we get cured violence, groups and drug rehabilitation, programs and workforce development programs as part of the DA's office, which it has not been in the past. I want to see people who've done, state I'm, come from prisons and go into our schools and talk about the fact that there would be a better life and better paths for young people to follow. And, last but not least, some happy dance core answer. Questions I'm trying to be quick because I know you have a larger damn agenda in front of you. Yes, we are working towards hon the side end. We are working towards no bail at all, no cash bail. This is the issue right now, so, even before the pandemic, the only programs for pretrial diversion and for securing was once a week check-ins. So you had all the non crawling up qualifying offenses where you didn't get bail at all right, yeah, everybody was just our ward or supervised. Release and supervised. Release was only one check-in a week that was supervised release or you had people who were really defendants in very violent crimes and likely the remand would be requested. There is still very little to do in the middle, so you want to get someone drug rehabilitation, you want to get them mentors, so they make better choices and better pads. You want to make that as part of the court system. It doesn't exist yet so we are working feverishly to try and get it as part of what the court system is able to do. We don't even have electronic monitoring right now as part of supervised release, so we've actually have a not-for-profit we're trying to work with on that. We're also talking to the Sheriff's Office, but it is a huge issue. It is my goal and I will at some point soon not soon, maybe but some point get to no cash bail. I think it is a priority of my administration and we need to get there. So you know in your neighborhood we had- and many of you know this already well the double homicide and the suicide, or at least me, the woman- and there are two children who were found dead in their apartment. It is still an ongoing investigation, but you know that was a tragic scene. Many of you know that I went there. I saw the scene I wanted to make sure that I actually saw it for myself, and you know there's still tragedies that are going on. So please check in with your loved ones. I see the borough president, there so I'm going to just say one so that you hear it more than once tonight. Please fill out your census and please vote on Tuesday, whoever you are voting for. It is our right to vote. Please utilize that right in the meantime, I am still here just because I went down the block and I'm in a different office. My email is cats at Queens da org cats at Queens da org. It goes right to my phone I'm still available I'm still around. You can also follow me on Queens da Facebook Queens da cat's Facebook Twitter Instagram. You can see all of our views and all that we're doing and I just want to wrap up with this. We are in national unrest. Right now, I have been part of the rallies. You can look on all my social media. You will see the statements I've made on George Floyd. You will see that we called for the prosecution of all four officers. We have been extremely supportive of change and we're trying to be part of the answer. So, oh and last but not least, I guess missing. Women asked us to comment. We said early on. We will not prosecute and have not prosecuted for curfew violations. Only. We did not prosecute for social distancing. It did not happen. What I will tell you is I'm, not even going to tell you we didn't prosecute for protesting, because it's your First Amendment right to protest like it was mine to be out on the street protesting and no one gives you permission to do that. It is your First Amendment right and there is no prosecution for that in Queens. There were two people that were brought in on that and it was immediately dismissed. So thank you very much for having me tonight and Queens da Katz. Thank you very much and I'm. Looking through the chat and I see yes, it three people that have posted it to the chat and I'll. Just let them ask their question: Dorothy Phelan Balin and will unmute her please Kevin Dorothy, yes, I wondered if the district attorney could elaborate on the new Bureau that will address housing and homeowner issues. Sure so you know, I was the borough president for six years, as many of you know and I worked for borough. President Shulman, one of the things we found kept coming up time and time again was predatory lending people that bought other folks homes. The contract would say one thing and what they would say to the person is another. You know: I'll buy your house, I know it's worth $500,000, it's $300,000 I'm, giving you can always buy it back. If you change your mind, but that's never. In the contract, there are also predatory lending issues so from a housing perspective. I wanted to make sure there and we're in the process now of doing it or forming a hotline so that if we can see a trend, that's going on in one community where someone is trying to buy out houses, and we can see that that's happening, and they do that in order to disrupt the fiber of a neighborhood, so that people sell easier so that we had a hotline to keep track of those cases to make sure that we can actually get to those who are trying to disturb the neighborhoods. And you know many times those aren't prosecuted because they're hard to get convictions. From my perspective, if we find out who they are, and we start investigating them, they're not coming back to your neighborhood and that's good, there's also employee discrimination that this Bureau will be dealing with any kind of employee discrimination because of your documentation. Because of your nationality, because you love what you love whatever it is. This is the Bureau who will help when employees are being taken advantage of as well and last but not least, they go out to every construction site that there is an accident, a major accident, to make sure that we're not relying only on the site inspector by the contractor or by the developer, and we investigate on our own okay, the next question, and can we do go quickly with these questions because we have a full agenda. I'll try to be quicker. Sorry, how not you to be quicker, that's right, but the questions, Margaret, Flanagan, I'm, sorry, keV, hi! Thank you and da cat's-eye I just wanted to share a thought that many of the crimes that affect our quality of life, like people steal stealing the rear view minors of cars breaking into cars breaking in through a window and stealing a computer. My understanding is that, under the new bail laws, those kinds of crimes carry less weight now as well, but those kinds of crimes are often repeat criminals throughout our part of Queens. You find it's the same guy 40 times over. So what can you do to? Please ensure that repeat: criminals are not released that easily so under the new laws that go into effect on July 3rd, we are researching them and looking into them, but they do account for recidivists. They do account for being able to Alan I'm, losing my voice, I apologize being able to hold people or do supervised release for repetitive crimes, so there will be more of a chance to keep to put people into supervised release. The problem you have right now is that there's no help for anyone is going through these types of issues, so you can't put them in a workforce development program because they're stealing, you know the minors, because they can't get a job and so we're working towards that. But the new law is to take into account recidivists that continue to steal and we're just basically, you know traveling through the system like just going revolving system, and so we should have a little more power, but what's going to really change the game is when we get rid of the bill and put a lot of more of these supervised release programs in place, so someone gets arrested. We say: look you need to go through this program or and then we'll release you from your obligations to the courts. That is going to be a lot more helpful than having people simply go through the revolving system. That is happening now. These ensure the system protects us as the victims, as well as offering the criminals opportunities. Please do right, it's always a balance. I hear you. Thank you all right, so LOB song, hissing whoosh, hissing whoosh. If I know, we can send you for everyone's edification, a summary on the bail laws. Okay, that's been distributed to us and maybe people are interested in seeing how they've changed all right. So can you please email its office and Miss Reed or destroy dissemination? Everyone, okay idea. First of all, congratulations on your! So you just mentioned about there's more shootings going on in Queens. Then you have special bureau to go after them and I. Think I've read the news about New York City, the Palacio saying they are going to get rid of the crime branch and then there's a movement going on about it. No funding for police, so you could do a little bit so to be exact just because I summarized before there is a thirty seven point: three percent year-to-date North Koreans high in shootings in the county of Queens South, I Drive, the numbers with sixty two point: five percent increase, and so the citywide increases twenty four point: three percent. So we are ahead of that. My vc0, which is violent criminal enterprise Bureau. Their goal is to find the traffickers of these guns and also to find the gang members, and we want to make sure that we get to the top right. I'm gonna get make sure that way. If there is a gang that we are heading getting to the heads of these gangs, because if you don't and you just get the shooters or you just get the gang members, other gangs, as we all know, other people just take the place. And so we need to dismantle the gangs we need to dismantle the gun traffickers, while still making sure that we're working with our young people, especially to limit the market and to limit the desire they have for guns and so yeah. It's really a two-pronged way of doing it. You know I believe that if we get the traffickers, where we don't limit the market, that we don't have these programs to make sure that people aren't making the market for the guns, it's only one prong and we're not gonna be able to solve the issue. So it's a very active Bureau and we will get the guns. I promise you that all right. The last question for I guess last question: Fausto yeah, yes, I am here hello, the DEA cats I have a question. What well, when it comes to guns who gang members I'm gonna use a term D gang the gang. If there is their way, most kids were seven years ago, have left that and I still see, I go to suppressant and I still see these kids on those things. I can't I can't hear you I, don't understand the question: can someone repeat it I'm sorry, I'm gonna, repeat this I? Don't, though, can you hear me now I can hear you I just knew we were going in and out before. Okay now, if they're, those kids that seven years ago, seven years or ten years ago, we're members of a gang and they have left all those gangs and I- have gone to a few prisons and I still in sight. I still recognize these kids on the board. If they're on post movie team were that prisons have if there are a way to remove that, then out of those bulletin boards, given the fact that they haven't done anything wrong seven years to seven years ago. So after ten years, if you commit nonviolent crimes, you can actually get them seals under some circumstances. I don't know so. I look for violent crimes, it's a little bit different because you can't seal those convictions. Yet I, don't know where the state is moving towards, where you can't seal them. As far as how long they stand the bulletin, boards I have to admit. I. Don't know the answer to that, but I'm happy to find out for you. I have found quite honestly in this world that I'm living in you know seven years. You know it could be a long time, but it could be a day right depending on with what the world that they're coming out of they're trying but I will say this, though the gang members who have turned their life around, we would love to work with them and in your capacity, if you ever come across we'd love to work with them to go into schools, to talk to young people to become part of mentorship programs. Why I think it is crucial for the next generation? Thank you. Thank you. So much Queens the end thanks for joining us today and with your presentation, and we look forward to seeing you in the future. I'm is English. Just so you know, Colleen Babu is the bada. The executive assistant district attorney for community engagement is on this call right now. There will now from now on, be someone from the DA's office at your meetings, and the purpose of the purpose of that is new. Your members should be able to ask them anything. They want to bring back information to bring back questions either on ongoing cases as much as we can comment, but also idea and issues in the community. I'd also like to thank miss Melton from your office who participated earlier in the year in our human trafficking forum, and she was very informative. Thank you very much. Oh let her know. Thank you. Thank you. Have a beautiful, say everyone. Thank you like to welcome our Queens borough, president Sharon Lee. She has done a phenomenal job since January and she's been receptive to Queens community board number three and we appreciate the relationship that we built over the last few months, Green's row President Lee good evening. Thank you. Share, English hi, miss Reed a good evening, community board 3, and is that hunter that corn, you see hunter carrot a on sir good evening. Everyone thank you for the invitation to come by and say hello, I know, I don't come to the community boards. Often I believe my colleague, Lisa Adkins, is in the room in this virtual room as well, but I wanted to accept the invitation to come by and say hello I see dr. Collins, the president-elect of the so at a New York State Chapter of the association of black psychologists, very good, to see you, of course, back in Queens. We love to see you here and you'll be hearing from her shortly and her expertise, and she certainly has a tremendous amount of expertise and also vision for her organization and how it may serve all of New York State, but in particular in Queens, but as the DA mentioned census, if you haven't already I urge you of course, you're going to pay attention throughout the community board meeting. But if you haven't already, please do fill it out and of course we have an election under way. I am NOT on the ballot, but you will get to. We will get to elect our next borough president, and so we do have a primary underway and I urge you. If you haven't already to vote early voting, has been in a whirl. Go ahead. Sorry wait first, hi yeah we're good, so this week has been a whirl. The last several months have been a whirl. Well, I heard us talking a little bit about the Supreme Court decisions. I came down this week. Lgbtqia+ writes you know affirming that equal protection equality is extended to whoever you are and whomever we love. That was certainly a victory and, of course, earlier today the Supreme Court's decision on daca to uphold daca I think was also a victory. We should be celebrating our victories, even though there's plenty of work to, but today's ruling certainly keeps young immigrants out of the shadows and that's certainly important in a borough like Queens, we are the most diverse County in the continental US in a particular bar three one of the most diverse boards community districts. So it's there's been a lot going on in Queens. As you know, phase two is right: around the corner of the reopening. Everything has been you. The reopening has been a bit of a moving target for certainly the downstate region, including Queens County, just because we were the UH, the unenviable marker being the epicenter of the epicenter of the pandemic. But we do know that it's a race against time, but also that having it at the expense of lost lives or losing lives is not an option for us here in New, York, and so all hands are on deck. In addition to the census and the election on the reopening, and certainly on this resurgence in the call and the demand and the urgency of Hertford for justice or for the affirmation of black lives. Mattering and it's a you know, it's there are righteous and rightful protests throughout the city. All across Queens I have seen so many protests in rally and marches multiple a day across our borough, which is the largest borough by landmass and by far the borough of Queens, is a standing, is marching for justice. We're sharing enough is enough or hearing I can't breathe. We've been hearing that for several years now, Eric garner feels like yesterday, and perhaps if we had handled that properly as a city, perhaps it would not have taken a knee on someone's neck -, finally to finally bring about the urgent call for calls for change. So there's a lot going on, but in the midst of all of that I had the honor and privilege to make some appointments on our community boards and I was absolutely delighted to in honor. To do so. I know we have a couple of first-time members. We also have several who were appointed for an additional twenty two month term and for those who were appointed for an additional twenty two month term. I. Thank you for serving the extended 60 days. In light of the pandemic, we had to tap into the City charters allowance for a 60-day extension to your term, but we're glad that you are back and we should be really proud. You know: I reviewed 595 applications for the 14 community boards and I am proud of every single of the 339 appointments across the 14 community boards. Our borough is in good hands. Community board 3 not with them, is certainly one of them, so Thank You, chair English, for indulging and for the invitation to come address the board I'm happy to take questions, but you probably just want me out of the way, because your next speaker is dynamic way. We thank you again for the wonderful appointments, we're happy to have two new members and congratulations. Yes, and we have some questions. First, what I like all Edwin Wesley head Wesley, do you need to unmute em Kevin? Okay, go ahead, I'm, good Thank You mr. Lee for joining us tonight. It's good to put a face against a name I wanted to. Thank you for your food collaboration with Fresh Direct. We just recently participated in that from the Jackson Heights beautification group and we unloaded 100 kotnis at st. Mark's, Episcopal Church, and it was delightful to see all the people that were so glad to have these this food delivered to them. So thank you very much, thank you and Arthur Tyler. If I'm a chair, English, Thank, You mr. Wesley, and to the beautification group for getting the food out there. That's part of your office, Laroy, Fresh, Direct and many other initiatives that we've had over the last hundred days plus have been really trying to stem the tide of food insecurity which has been on the rise and we're trying to curb that, and not just for humans, but also four-legged, sometimes three-legged, furry family members as well. We just announced and launched and as partnership with the ASPCA, they donated tons of food over 2,500 bags of dog and cat food, and we got those two a lot of the food pantries across Queens as well, in particular those who serve seniors and this time of social isolation. We want to make sure that they're able to also take care of their companions and their family members. But thank you, mr. Wesley, to you and to the group and many other organizations are partners in Queens who, without whom we couldn't get the grocery boxes, to people and to families. But the food insecurity is something that we are monitoring very closely. We see lines around blocks growing exponentially every week for the weekly food pantries, and so it's deeply concerning and especially in light of the dire budget straits on the horizon for fiscal 21 around the corner. There's a lot of pain up ahead, but we're going to do everything possible to stem every tie that we can, as we surged forth in the recovery and rebuild stage for Queens, but thank you mr. Risley Thank You art, the Tyler. Was this a question for yes? Thank you. I would like ask President Lee of question that I'm afraid of a big homeless problem coming and I'm just wondering what help is available safe for people. That's never been homeless before becoming affected. The big balance dude. Once the moratorium on evictions ends. Will we start seeing a lot of homeless people and you know for the benefit of the community they're best left in place. You know I treat by than putting them up in a home like Belton you're, not wrong, and the shelters you know are or not, there's not much room at the shelters as it is. There is a lot of discussion about the imminent expiration of the of the moratorium. It shows moratorium in August and what that will mean for residents for families for small businesses. There's a lot of discussion on that. A lot of that is going to depend on the resources that we are counting on from the federal government that it's pretty dire. The city and state budget situation is tough, I mean if you in full candor and we're all aware of it. The economy has been at a near standstill for four or four weeks for months, and so a lot of its going to depend on how we how we go into the reopening phases. We are in phase one, how we can start generating the economy again safely safe as safely as possible, but going back to the we already had a homelessness crisis before the pandemic. That was an underlying condition as much as it was an underlying condition that we were the most under bedded burrow in terms of hospitals in Queens. It was an underlying condition that we were arc. Our school kids are the least funded by the city of Newark. New York and a school kid from every other borough that our elders have the least amount of funding than any other elder in the city of New York. So the homelessness crisis is something that has been has expounded in recent years in particular, but we are looking at the folks who are not yet homeless as what I'm hearing from you, those who might be in danger of homelessness once the moratorium is lifted, there's a lot of moving parts. I know it all just seems like it's around the corner, but there are a lot of discussions on how to whether it's a matter of extending, but also, if you think about it, there's a there's, a ripple effect of extending the moratorium as well on landlords, and things like that. So that is that is definitely a concern and we are. We are working on it as quickly as possible and as safely as possible that a lot of it will depend on the next month and how we reopen and how successfully we can reopen and get they conduct back up. I will I will do. We will do our best Thank You. Mr. Tyler hi president Lee, that was our last question: okay, taking the time to meet with us a second meeting that you've attended our virtual meeting. So thank you very much and we wish you all the best in the future Thank You, chair English. Thank you, misery. Thank you to the board. Congratulations on an earful board for the for the next 12 months and yeah I'm here through December 31st, so I will see you sooner than later. Thank you. Thank you. Our next presenter will be dr. Dana Collins, the president of the association of black psychologists, dr. Collins. All right can everyone hear me I think I'm a muted. Yes, you are okay well good evening. Everyone again, I'm dr. dana colin than the and the now president of the New York association of black psychologists and I just want to start by saying that I feel really honored and currently be doing with you tonight community dialogue, one of my favorite, the user-agent, because we can really learn a lot from each other. We can learn about our community. Strengths needs what our resources are and ideas for addressing our challenges. I want to focus my comments tonight on the idea of coming together for healing, because there is a lot to you right now. I know that we all have our own sort of stories and versions about what's been happening in the past few months, but we're all different ways: 19 I, don't even have to list everything. There's been food insecurity, enormous loss of one's loss, of way of life, uncertainty, we've all experienced the pandemic and then right on the heels of that. To compound things, there's been more visibility of the systemic racism and racial trauma that has plagued this country, since it was founded, we've seen over and over the devaluation and disregard for black lives, and for many of us it's brought on trauma reactions. Many of us are concerned about our safety or the safety of our loved ones. We might have trouble sleeping trouble, concentrating trouble getting things done headaches. Those are all responses to trauma. Many of us are being exposed to traumatic things right now and it is having real impacts on us individually and collectively. So a lot of collective trauma is happening right now and what do I mean by collective trauma collective trauma? It refers to the traumatic to a traumatic event that a large group of people, and it might be a racial group, community and neighborhood or a whole society experiences together. Excuse me, I, think my connection is okay, so when I am when a community is facing a massive trauma such as you know, the effects of Koba, 19 or racial violence there's often a shared emotional bond amongst people in the community and that's a powerful thing if you heard that collective trauma hurts, but on the other hand, that shared experience of shared thoughts and feelings mean that I mean they mean that nobody is alone. None of us are really alone we're in this together and for this particular community. That is a really powerful thing if several people have already spoken to the diversity that Queens broadly, is one of the most, not the most ethnically diverse urban areas in the world. I love to see us the world, and it's also one of the most linguistically diverse. There are at least a hundred thirty-eight different languages spoken in Queens alone, and there is also a vibrant and growing immigrant population, and so what all? That means. What does all that mean? It means that there is a wide range of knowledge, viewpoint and experiences that can be drawn on for strength and healing, and moving toward diversity of this kind means that we can feel in each other's blind spots to really see things more clearly and come up with really good solutions for moving things forward and in terms of trauma. Any crisis that is really important during crises like the one where the several crises were experiencing now feelings of stress hopelessness, confusion can sometimes turn people against each other, but on the other hand, a crisis also provides an opportunity for coming together and that's really what I want to encourage everyone to do come together. The other thing is that a lot of times, relationships that are built during or through hard times can be exceptionally resilient, and if we take care to cultivate them now they can endure even when the new normal comes about, so they can be lasting and very powerful. So what I am I guess the underlying thing I'm saying Aaron, couraging or calling for a rather than turning against each other, let's turn towards each other. Let's come together, I'm encouraging that the community bring its wide range of skills and experience and knowledge together to get through the crises of COBIT 19 in racial trauma. So how do we do that? Well, we're in a great place to do it now, with this community board talking about what our strengths are and what our challenges are just having the dialogues are so important and these kinds of conversations can help us to discover our shared values, because, even though we might come from different places have different customs, we can find that we have some shared values and shared goals, things that we all want, and it's really important to get on the same page about that. We need to identify what resources and strengths we have and, along with that, reflect on areas that might need strengthening and talk about how we can strengthen the things like that, need that it's also important to discuss responsibility, and that means identifying community leaders, agencies and organizations and learning what their role is, what they are doing, what they're supposed to be doing and talking about how to hold people accountable, but the things that they have been called to do so, there's a lot that can be gained from building community and joining together in solidarity. Talk with each other start with the dialogue, see what you have in common see what your strengths are continue to attend this and other community meetings encourage others to come. Talk to your leaders find out what community agents agencies are a your neighborhood and find out what they're doing and how you can contribute. We all have something to offer each other. Thank you. Thank you, dr. Collins. Does anyone have any questions for dr. Collins? You want to unmute just in case Kevin I not have everybody top chatbox. Anyone can unmute themselves. Okay, I haven't I, haven't, pressed the master mute so everyone's doing very well good, dr. Collins berry for taking the time out to speak with us, and yes, it's very important that we all do come together and that's the one thing that I love about Queens community board number three. So again, thank you so much for taking the time dr., Collins and all the best in your new role. Yeah. Absolutely thank you and if anybody does have any questions about services or resources, you can email me up put that in the chat box. Please put that in here. Thank you appreciate it all right. So we'll move on to our public hearings, Edmund Rosenbaum, our business echo remember, is the m1. Is the NYPD here I apologize? Thank you so much Kevin one fifteenth precinct here. Yes, we have a few more two more sorry, I'm, sorry about that the 115th precinct they should be calling in or did we mute any of the phone calls there's a caller one and everyone is okay. Well, you know, let me check all right. Please 9-1-1, I unmuted caller. One do call it two in qualifying all right: hello, hi. Is this one fifteen precinct? No, this is Frank Taylor. How are you all right, Frank, okay, call. The number two miss Reed did 150m see a caller number I, don't see a caller to ICU caller five, a caller one and a caller eight they're, all unmuted caller five or caller eight. Are you 115 precinct? No okay. So what we're going to do is we're going to move on to the mayor's office. Jessica Przewalski's. Are you on high ever Neda? Yes, I am I'm gonna. Let my colleague and about Palma go first. If that's okay from testing trace. Yes, please and then you can continue, go ahead about. Thank you. Thank you, Miss English. Thank you. I'm community board, three for allowing us to come before you today. My apologies that my camera is acting up and so I'm only on audio, as Jessica mentioned, I am, and about Panama I am a former council member served my community for fourteen years and after I was term limited. The mayor asked me to come be part of his team as a deputy commissioner. At the Department of Social Services and just recently with and limit that we've been dealing with the blossom, ministration asked me to come on as a chief equity officer to be part of the test and trace corpse that New York City has put together to deal with the Covid-19 ninety pandemic that we have faced for the last few months, and so in this role. In this capacity, I am working with a dynamic team of individuals focused on that we can get New, York City back a safe and healthy place, and so we know that we've heard a lot about what's going on with this pandemic, and we wanted to make sure that, as far as the test and trace corpse that one of the key components of our program is to make sure that folks are interested. That folks are once they're testing that were able to do some contact tracing. If anyone has come in contact with other individuals and then expose and then provide food with resources, take care at home and safely separate from others, and so we launched the testing trees and take care program. Our mission is, like I, said, to exam to be village in testing tool to make sure that we're tracing and they were supporting communities by offering places where they can safely separate, should they need to from their families and we're doing that by offering hotels at the interface want of reopening your city, we need the help of our community members. Individuals like yourself to help spread the word about the critical part of the program that we're doing, and that is testing right. We want every New, Yorker, Oh, New York is now can and should get tested, like I mentioned before, testing has been expanded to New Yorkers, regardless of symptoms or exposures. I know that, with all the protests and all the actions that have been taking place in the last few people hope they have participated. So if you have been one of those protests or rallies were and are not experiencing any symptoms, we're asking that you should definitely get tested on to be on the safe side, and you can find a testing site near where you live. By going on our website. Wwsz gov slash called the test or by calling three one directive to testify in your community. The you know the test and trace course is here to help every single New Yorker. We want to make sure again that we are reaching everything that we can specially in those communities that were mostly affected by this by this pandemic and we're doing that by offering the free testing by making sure than anyone with the virus receives care, and anyone who chooses who need to isolate can do so safely to prevent to prevent the spread, and so we were doing that by I mean you know we put together a group of workers who we refer to as contact tracers, who will be proactively reaching out to individuals, acts encourage them to be attested and then I'm continuing to make sure that we do follow through in case, we need to trace anyone. You've come in contact with I, provide those resources for New Yorkers again to make - to get them to a place where they can eventually be healthy and home again, and we can get back to some sort of. We are now trying to get as many individuals in the community as involved and so we're asking folks share. You know any of our messaging media we're asking to help us engage the constituency in your communities. You are leaders in your communities. Folks trust you in your communities, you deliver. You know you you're able to connect to your community and such a way that people know that people know that what is being done through this program. It is in the best interest of your community, but New York City as a whole to enable us to get back again a place, so we can be safe and healthy. All right! Thank you! Miss Palmer and, as she mentioned, everyone please get tested. Please encourage those too tested and Jessica. Does anyone have any questions for Miss Palmer before Jessica completes the presentation, any crazy questions, - tracing corpse, Jessica! You can continue. Okay, thank you! So I'm just gonna go through some general announcements from the mayor's office from the last month. I'm, sorry, I'm, sorry, Jessica, I'm, sorry, miss English I would be remiss if I didn't mention this important piece of information about our program and is we understand, especially you know, underserved communities and communities that have been hit the hardest that we deal with. We may deal with a huge population who may be undocumented, and so our program is not designed to be punitive in any way. Shape or form is designed to discourage people from coming forward to get tested. We know one. Our program is not interested in any immigration status. We solely are interested in having people testing and having people again return back to their communities safe and healthy, and so we really need to emphasize that even if you're in an undocumented New Yorker, you should come forward and get tested without any fear of that. You will be this. You know you, your privacy will be the Scopes. Thank you for clarifying that, so everyone should be tested despite your status, so please encourage so Jessica. You can give your food points and then 115 precinct will be speaking right after Jessica and then we'll go into our meeting business. All right go ahead, Jessica! Thank you. Annabelle thanks MA, so I want to start by wishing everybody a happy Pride Month. We are moving into Phase two. As of Monday, so phase two is going to include offices in store, retail, hair, salons and barbershops outdoor dining, real estate, vehicle sales leases and rentals commercial building management. Then businesses like laundromats and electronic repair, our dedicated business research hotline for anybody who is a small business and wants guidance, is workers who call 301 will be connected to the Department of consumer and worker protection. If there are concerns of their employer, isn't providing the appropriate amount of PPE or enforcing social distancing in the workplace. In addition to these businesses, the mayor also announced that playgrounds will be open as a Phase two. So this morning was signed an executive order by the mayor, putting into action open restaurants, and this program is expected to save 5,000 restaurants and 45,000 jobs. It's going to create a new and streamlined application process to allow restaurants to expand capacity outdoors, so restaurants at any bars cafes that serve food, will have five options to mix and match between curb Lane seating, that's being piloted through Labor Day sidewalk seating, which is going through the end of October backyard and patio seating, which will be ongoing, open street seating, which will go nights and weekends beginning in July, and then bid that manage pedestrian plazas will work with D-O-T to help restaurant set up seating. So these application sort of the application for this program will be live tomorrow morning for establishments to self-certify and there's no additional needed application with the State Liquor Authority. The application can be found at nyc.gov, slash open restaurants. So we encourage all restaurants that well, if I meet those criteria to apply for a self-certification tomorrow morning, SVS that the Small Business Services has been working to distribute 2 million face mass citywide and with the start of phase 2, they will be distributing an additional 2 million to small business and their employees in community board 3. This has been through a partnership with the 82nd Street partnership, so they will be the point person in that commune bored for these masks for small businesses. Now on the topic of housing, the rent guidelines board voted last night to approve a proposal that rents will be frozen for one year leases and for the first year of two-year leases during the second year of two year, leases landlords can only bump the rent by one percent and these changes will be going into effect from October 1st lasting until September 2021 mayor have been advocating for a rent freeze for months in order to make sure that we're helping these 2 million New Yorkers, who live in about a million rent, stabilized apartments and an answer to the questions that were posed earlier. If an individual is facing an addiction or being threatened with being evicted, the eviction moratorium has that's extended through August 20. It is for those who have Covid-19 19, related non-payment cases. We do have free legal advice and counsel available from the mayor's office to protect tenants. So individuals can call 3-1-1 or group go through the mayor's office to protect tenants, contact us form on our website, and anybody who has knowledge of city marshals, attempting to execute on warrants of eviction during the suspension can report this activity by calling DOI bureaus of city marshals at two one, two, eight two: five: nine five: three on a focus to Kovan 19, a bit of announcements. The mayor announced three new coppa 19 centers of excellence and communities of color that have been hardest hit by the pandemic, including one in Jackson Heights. In parts of Jackson Heights, there were approximately thirty 37 percent of people who had tested positive for Koba 19. That's a really high percentage within a small pocket. The new Gotham health side-step will provide comprehensive outpatient services for recovering koban 19 patients, as well as pulmonary care, radiologic and diagnostic services, mental health services to help address anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and psychological distress. The three sites are projected to open in the fall and patients can be referred to them after a hospital visit or through the primary care provider. Although a positive, Koba, 19 test, result, antibody or not, is not required and the goal of these centers is preventive medicine and long-term health. Recovering on the note of healthcare. Nyc care is going to be expanding to Queens four months ahead of schedule, and this is the citywide initiative to guarantee healthcare or all New Yorkers, by providing access to low-cost and no-cost primary care for those who are ineligible or can't afford insurance, and it helps by the healthcare disparities that have been made clear by Koba 19 for more information on that program, please go to NYC care, DOT NYC and lastly, I'd like to just highlight some of the announcements that have been made recently with the demand for reforms with NYPD. The city has demonstrated a commitment to building trust between our officers and communities via shifting funding from NYPD to youth and social services. Moving vender enforcement out of NYPD to a civilian agency, hiring community ambassadors to serve as liaisons between NYPD and New Yorkers. We are working with investing about 10 million dollars into what is known to cure violence movement into neighborhoods that have the highest rates of gun. Violence citywide there is a new body cam footage policy that is promoting transparency and accountability, so that all video and audio footage is released within 30 days when an officer discharges, a firearm that hits or couldn't someone when an officer discharges a Taser in a way that could result in death or substantial bodily harm or when an officer uses force in death or great bodily harm, and in addition to that, we've moved six hundred officers out of the anti-crime unit. These are the plainclothes officers in an orientation toward neighborhood policing and making sure that we build that neighborhood and community relationship with our officers and, lastly, an increased time limit with our disciplinary system, where incidents with substantial bodily injury will result in the police, commissioner, making a determination within 48 hours of the incident, whether the officer on modified duty or suspension and NYPD will conclude those investigations within two weeks, more transparent discipline, we're all trial decisions or settlements going forward will be posted online and body camera footage policy we're all video and audio footage must be released within 30 days when an officer discharges, a firearm that hits or could hit someone an officer discharges a Taser in a way that could result in death or substantial bodily harm, or an officer's use of force, results in death or great bodily harm. And again, all of this footage will be published, will be publicly available online on an orientation to increase transparency and to increase that accountability for PD. If anybody has any questions, I'm happy to answer them well, Jessica I'm just going to go through what we have in the in the chat area. We have one more study graph to you. The freeze of rents apply to new rentals and, if they fall under the category of being sorry and I'm blanking on the term of rent, stabilized, okay, laughs, I had a question. What about told cars during this time? I'd I have not heard that there's any difference and took. Are you talking about the open restaurants policy? Lob song? Can you just quickly just clarify what you're talking about so what I'm saying that during the shutdown I saw some cop told I, don't know how you're gonna deal with it and the other question was I thought ruling New, York, City disparity crime branch there with a crime branch being dismantled, officers can use an ounce to that I. Think that's operating as normally would be all right. Thank you so much Jessica and thank you so much Annabelle. So our next week, you'll be like wait. I have a question all right, please Frank, you're gonna! Be that it's gonna, be you who's gonna, be the last question and I think David Reserve has also been waiting patiently. David, it turned off David you go, then mr. Chowdhury and then Frank you're, the last one David. We can't hear you David, you don't hear you David type. Your question in the chat and I will ask it for you. We can't hear you, okay, we'll come back to you, but we can't hear you right now because, even though your mic is on, we cannot hear you. Mr. Chowdhury. Can you go and then Frank sorry David, your Michaelis denim is English. My question is I heard today that our New York police traffic department is to be transferred to the transpiration department. There will be no more under my PD as well as the school safety will no more be under NYPD. Is it correct, or can you explain it I think that's still being largely discussed as the City Council and the mayor's office are discussing the budget and where the defunding of PD is going to come from and how that is going to operate. That's not been decided yet all right. Thank you, Frank Taylor! Oh yes, thank you very much. Happy Father's Day to everyone. I have a two-fold question. The first one is mortgage protection, I've heard a lot about rental protection, but I've heard nothing about mortgage protection and the second thing is: why was this area put in Jackson Heights when Jackson Heights, you state he'd, had a 34% rate which is high, but Corona had a percentage of 49.4% of corona virus in Corona? So why was it something put there so, on mortgage protections, that's largely been managed by the state. I can email the community boards and guidance that I have there and then on the topic of these koban 19 centers of excellence, there were three of them placed in the city. The one that we got in Queens is in Jackson Heights, but there are a lot of different resources coming to the hardest-hit areas of Queens. Corona has been part of the hardest hit neighborhoods that are part of the restaurant revitalization program, some youth programs for the summer. So it's not to say that you know neighborhoods are being overlooked. There are different resources going towards different neighborhoods in an effort to make sure that we're getting as much supports out there as possible, but Jessica as Frank said, it's very important that our area covers East, Somers, north Corona and Jackson Heights, and it should be consideration for those two areas, because we were all hit very hard. Absolutely and I continue to advocate for these things, and we continue to work on announcing more programs and different supports from the administration. Thank you, I'm sorry, miss English, I would just I would just add just for this fancy mention. We also have mobile units that are placed strategically in hardest-hit areas and so again, right with the engagement with community engagement and I'm hearing feedback from the community. We will we also deploy those mobile units accordingly, to make sure that we are hitting every community all right and besides the true P that Jessica just said were stood up. We also have a hundred and eighty other sites that are dedicated Covid-19 testing sites and to provide testing and to provide services and those you can find by going to WWN YC dagger, slash, covetous and or calling three one and you can find one as close to cedar yeah. Alright, thank you! So much David. We still can't hear you I'm. Sorry, maybe take your earphones off and just let your speaker from your computer, all right, Dave, we'll talk later all right, so one 15th precinct good evening how you doing Louis has everybody been so I got disconnected a little bit earlier, but I'm back on dealing with the time and everything I mean more than anything, I, just rather just open it right up to any questions that anybody has for us. Does anybody have any questions for any like I wanted to know? If there's any number of arrests have been done during the lockdown because of the statistics of the arrests in our area, all the rest are like social distance related anything like that. What do you want all the rest? No just the most related with the protests. Breaking that stores, and all this day, oh no as for that I'm pretty sure we have, we have none, we didn't have any real disruption. The only thing Colbert related was we had a uptick in burglaries with a lot of stores being closed, which we did make a good number of arrests, but in the last month, compared to the previous month, with the burglaries have come down, we're still up in burglaries compared to the same period last year, but only by one. The other previous months of from April to May was very high, but we made some good arrests and that's come back down and now that businesses are starting to open back up, you know it's looking better with that was our main problem doing Colvin. As far as protests. Now we haven't had any looting. No right there were some rumors, but on thankfully the community was very peaceful. The protests were peaceful and yeah. Does anyone else have any other questions? Yes, this is a Margaret Flanagan police officer. You know, I am always bringing to people's attention. The persistent homeless camps and the BQE underpasses 35th Avenue is the worst, but it's also a 34. 32Nd 31st and I've been informed that jurisdictionally, that is more than 108 precinct, but the people are not encampments. Come in to our precinct, where there's lots of public urination public drinking public defecation, like the mess on the streets on the side of our precinct, is very great, so I'd love to ask for your officers to do a little bit more patrolling on our blocks and for them to not just cut it all off. 1:08. Yes, no I'm, very aware of that situation, and it's it's tough, because we set about an operation would say breaking ground and we'll see the homeless out there, many nights you know and then sometimes we'll actually go breaking ground and for whatever reason now they're not there it's on. Unfortunately, sometimes it's had a mess you. We could see them out there, four or five days in a row and then three days in a row. They won't be there as far as the NCOs. They know about it. I'll I'll talk to them and coordinate more with the 108. So they could possibly do we could do a joint operation with the NCOs, cuz I, absolutely know what you're talking about the homeless. Even it's a big graffiti condition over there as well. There are regular patrol stops. Thank you very much. Anyone else we'll have one more question. Lieutenant I just want to get the spelling of your last name: SAR, a sy s, si R and a are a sy okay. Thank you. No problem all right, so the only other thing I'd like today, Kovac related, is on. You know we're trying to really shed share information and knowledge, but the business owners. The bar owners, the restaurant owners on the proper guidelines in how to operate. We've been trying to be a little hands off when possible, so they could conduct business properly. They've all been receptive. A lot of them were trying to really cooperate and they're applying for the proper licensing. So they could be a part of face to it. Outdoor dining and we've been trying to use our discretion and get them to cooperate. What having without having to use any enforcement. You know anybody you know comes in contact with in these business owners. You know just stressed to them that they have to do things by the books. I've been out there walking around on foot on Northern Boulevard, Roosevelt Avenue. You know trying to keep control of the situation without having to use any enforcement on anybody, and hopefully we get to it, but we're coming to face to hopefully everybody's safe and we can get to phase three soon all right. Thank you. So much my pleasure keep safe. Thank you very much Dober. It's time for our public hearings. Edmund Rosenbaum business, echo, chair good evening, didn't hear me. Yes, we can okay Tom quickly before I start on those questions like. Would it be Jeb Hawkes the links be open where Braun's application is in the chat box. I posted it already. Okay, so moving into a public hearings. First applicant is it's your. So rent is La Casa del dominicana restaurant 38:22 180 in Corona. It's an application for wine and beer license present. Do you see them here? Edmund? You have to look down the list earlier, yeah who's, that my name is Lucia. Sorry I'm, the applicants, eternity he's not dead, he's stuck out of the country I mean. Would you like to talk a little bit about the business or then you please, as the chair has requested, for you to do a presentation on the business? Please it's very simple. Mr. visi also would like to open up a bar Tavern in a location that was for lack of a better steam in a nightmare. He's trying to take the location over I think this is the second time lost race, which was there prior finally lost their liquor, license and moved out so he's assuming the business but he's coming to the community board saying he doesn't want it he's opening a bar in a tavern he's, not opening a restaurant and then gonna turn it into a nightclub. So we've come to the community board being straight with you. Instead of what these representatives do they come, they lie to you. They say they're gonna, be a restaurant, they're, gonna, close 11:00 and whatever other restrictions rules, and then they it takes your fun time to you straight we'd like to work with you guys to see what you would like and I know. I've met with your committee and they've proposed a bunch of stipulations which we've agreed to comply with for the different hours and how we have security and food. Our chairs report is in our folder, so you can review going negative session. I see some folks at you know no questions Edmund into chat, so then we'll move on to the second half okay, so kept looking. Thank you very much. Second applicant is christian quarterly businesses Varro's into eleven Northern Boulevard in Jackson Heights, just one we're on the line. Alright go ahead: okay, late good evening community for three were here again: we were last week name when, against on the community board. Take ten members today we see that we're in front of 32 members and we're an active family that we own a business on 82 13 in 211, and the reason for us applying for liquor license next door is because the department requiring us to get a public assembly which that our it's gonna be a very expensive way to go. So we are set out open Zion. You guys do not deny your application for us just to get a second liquor license where we could keep on operating the way we've been doing I'm just having a little icing at 8 to 11 and a 82 13 the restaurant and the lounge we form places are gonna, be serving food. Like add pain, been here in business for over 20 years now we hope to keep doing business in the community. I think a couple of board members have seen us there before for know. You guys and I hope you guys could help us out and I deniers, because it would be very expensive that we would have to go through the public assembly way doing business. We do have a personal chat box. Okay, so Sonia Roberts is asking. Can you repeat the question again? Do that part of how I need a separate license? Why we need a separate license because we have two locations we have to building separate buildings and by us United we would have to do a public assembly get sprinkler system and just a sprinkler system itself cost eighty thousand dollars on each building. The public assembly is another application that we have to submit with the building department. That's another expense. If we go just getting another liquor license, if only the nikah lights in application in the course of a nickel I, see that cost four thousand five hundred and forty dollars I think correct. So you know I, think yeah, there's a wall separating everything completely yeah the walls closed up, everything's, closed up completely correct I. Think I sent images on the pictures that in the shows, and we do the department. We also have a submit pictures to so prove that dog that the wall was closed. In that the separation was closing, was gonna, withdraw the application we had with the Department for the opening okay. As long as another question I really wish and I'll ever wrong, you read it please: okay, before I am a business include Sunday yeah, it would include to Sunday yeah I, don't wanna I, don't wanna. How can I say I do not wanna. What is that we're like I? Don't want to deny myself, let's say any days just in case I could say so. Try to know. Son mondays are like they'd, say: Memorial Day, you know, and so I dunno, so tight Sunday could stretch out to a little longer day, so I don't wanna hours, so I don't want on I, don't want to deny myself of being open or to a later time, all right. Thank you and Foster Rodriguez had a question not that question. Edmond I, don't have a question. No ladies up ELISA and I heard mr. Searcy earlier in the meeting. You know that Bulevar right now has been an issue because of the bars like you know, with SLA allowed II, allowing our restaurants or bar owners to sell liquor to go. So you know yes, there's been calm presence all over North the bullying one that just here as your establishment had any issues in relation to the NYPD. No, not in particularly isolated situation. No, it was an issue the other day that came out in the news, but we had it had nothing to do with us. We cooperated with the NYPD because we had surveillance cameras. We have surveillance cameras all over the restaurant. They asked us, they asked the business in the corner. They I like three businesses on the same block, two more lots of block on 82nd between 82nd 81st and 83rd. So not in particular, we haven't got no incident that we've been way enough. All right can I just jump in real quick just so everyone understands what he was just talking about was an active police investigation in the neighborhood. It had nothing to do with his restaurant being fired about correct bad yeah, I work, I work with the law, so I understand what you were talking about. I just want to make sure everyone understood. Thank you thank you for clarifying that. Thank you so much. Thank you. Kevin and then the last question: do you have any tickets? Nice? Yes, I think there are no I actually closed. All my tickets were SLA all the cards, but the thing is that remember we're not talking about Chris can both the car, which is La Pedrera coolerado, has had some fines, but they were very cleared up. We had a settlement where else la like, maybe two months ago, for all the noise and something that came back from 2017 or 16, and they just came up with it out of the blue, saying that there was a security car that we had on the post. I'd have had an altercation with in a plot with armed with a customer for decides. I know I'm, not impending. When you give us the hours of operation, we're gonna 12 to 12 to 3 being the last call for am closing. The stipulation that we signed in was the hours that we required that maybe you guys to the proof, hello, okay, hello, yes, hi good evening! Excuse me: okay, so, like I mentioned, ok, 99201, Roseville Avenue and we are open from 8:30 to 10:30 p.m. and basically it's a restaurant bakery. We saw slices of cakes as well as like whole cakes. For different occasions. We saw breads coffees iced coffees. We also have boat seats for more comfort for customers to sit down and the reason why we want to add or being one is for it to come along with like any food. They want to stop by and sit down and eat with, like, for example, like possibly like a hamburger with french fries. They want to, you, know, go along with the beer, but we're not trying to we're trying to limit the drinking. So maximum is only three beers. We're not trying to exceed that, and the beer distribution will be like. The time will be approximately, like, probably like 1:00 p.m. till a p.m. two hours before closing and we're planning to serve a like on from Monday through Sunday. What's the occupancy of how many seats so like I mentioned, we have for [ __ ] and for boat seats and like constantly like three table small tables, so in total it would be like 20, approximately 20 come customers to go in and have a seat. It is my business yeah we're not trying to like on yeah music. We did. We do have music, but it's not like loud music. It's only played, like you know, like a radio, so it's like really low. It's not something that will like. You know like bother like people they're coming to dine in it's nothing like loud. It's really like calm. We want it. We want to keep it basically like calm like for people to come in and dine but like to enjoy you know as they come in and sit down and eat.

Thank you for the business echo committee, who always works very hard on a monthly basis and I know. During the summer they may even have a meeting or two I'd like to thank everyone today. As you know, June is normally our outdoor meeting and I. Thank all of you that warrior blue and white and I look forward to seeing you throughout the summer with Adan, as we do. Our various community board events I just like to review some of the items that I have one of you for the chair. As you know, June is normally a busy month or Queens community board three. We would have celebrated our 20th annual Liane bond hold in Memorial HealthCare Expo and I thank Vivian and Miss Reed in the office for the they were planning. They were planning their planning and we're so disappointed that it had to be canceled as up now or postponed, but it may come back. I guess miss Reed will talk to it. I don't know. If we'll do it in the fall, but we'll see what will happen, the Queens borough presidents community board members throughout swearing in celebration. Pride Month, the Pride Parade. As you know, in Jackson Heights, that's normally a highlight of our summer right early summer and we normally would have participated. Numerous parades and events celebrating the importance of immigrants this year. However, all of our lives have been impacted in various ways by coping 19, peaceful protests, curfews and social distancing from our family and friends. Earlier this month, we watched George Floyd's loss of life spark a worldwide movement, and we must also remember Brianna Taylor armed with our Barre and many more ja, George's Brianna and Armas life mattered, and there must be changes implemented to prevent these systemic incidents from happening in the future. I welcome the new board members, comm blada and mark Burmeister. You have joined a very active community board and we look forward to your participation at our monthly and committee meetings. Welcome back to this Roberts Vivian, dr. Marvin Lucy, a mr. Gandhi Kevin, Hughes, panic, Marty, Lippert, ah Ralph Marino, Richard, Mullings, Adisa, Perez, Dorothy, Phelan, hi, Rodriguez, Leon, steel, Romero, Edmund, Rosenbaum, David, Rosero, Jimmy, Smith and Chatel Chanel commas and k2 are Washington Simon. You, your service on the community board, is truly appreciated and I just like to reiterate a few things that were discussed today at the meeting. Everyone please I, encourage you all to be tested. New, York City is one of the few places where we do have testing accessible. So please do your best to be tested, especially since at this moment right now, I'm working from home, but soon I'll be back out there taking the trains and the buses like everyone else. So we need to protect ourselves and one method is to get tested and to make sure that you're, okay and, as you know, many of us or many people are asymptomatic, absentee ballots, I hope everyone that could not vote in person that you did submit your absentee ballot. Also, your stimulus card. All this informations in your folder is in a debit prepaid card. I know there was some confusion about that. So please look at that. Mask I like to thank the mayor's office, I like to thank Jessica there. She worked with us for the community board to get a lot of mass on June 12th. We distributed over 500 mask at the chalk, walking chalk writing rally hosted by a child's place and we're also going to distribute masks in Jackson Heights on July 5th and diversity. Plaza and I will also miss Meade and I will also be contacting First Baptist Church that they have a pantry. The lines are so long over there we'll talk to them about handing out, masks and also elm core. So you know anytime, you do anything also. We always want to do something in each one of the areas that we cover: Dahmer, that's nice and north corona. Your website Advisory Committee we're in the process of redeveloping our website. So it's coming along nice. You know like to thank again the hard work of Kevin Edmund, Phillip and toy they're, keeping us out there on all our various social media and on our website all right, and then we also have Steve colonic. That's there for advice. Also so I'd like to thank our website, Advisory, Committee, I, hope I did not forget anyone. Finally, everyone the census right now, it's a d, a big concern with New York, City census and the US Census, the numbers in East all MERS and North corona they're under 50%. Please encourage those in the your surrounding community to fill out the census online right now they say in August, they'll have the door knocking, but the Community Board is partnering with the Queen's Community House and on June 22nd June 24th. There will be three different virtual town hall meetings that the pre Community Board will say a few words and we will be starting to promote tomorrow. So please encourage those and the flyer is in your folder I, don't know if you can see it. So it's a big concern. So again, over the summer, your committee chairs will be confident. May contact you about community events, but please everyone just to remember. You will receive emails about the events on July 5th and hoping to do a few other events in July in regards to handing out mass. So please check your emails and thank you again for all your service, wonderful serving as your chair. It's wonderful dealing with all of our 50 members and 50 different personalities, and thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I really appreciate when I had when I call on all anyone, they're able to say: okay, yes, really that has truly appreciated, because I know that you volunteer your time and there's so much other things going on in your personal lives. Again, please keep safe wear your PPE I will be around during the summer, so please can always contact me by phone or via email again. Thank you all for your service. Does anyone have any questions for me? Oh yeah I got one happy: Freedom Day immigrant Heritage, Month, Caribbean, Heritage, Month Jews, also gun violence, Awareness Month and yes, June 19 separate freedom day that was just passed on our state level and a lot of folks are getting off to recognize the end of slavery. So thank you and it is documented here on your view for the cheer that you'll go and review at the end of the meeting right, Frank venison, it could be a federal holiday. That's right! That's right! I did not yeah celebrated for many years before it was recently announced on a federal level. If I may it's my heartfelt sympathy to my friends, they both of color and I'm. Sorry, you have, you guys, have to go through this difficult time, but sometimes things happen for reason and the George Boyd killing incidents is taking the world stage and some changes Zubov come I know we have masks how can lose it but at the same time, like some changes coming out and I'm. Sorry for my fellow friends and thank you for what you guys do yes and thank you for those words Lobsang and as the speakers as dr. Dana Collins talked about earlier, is for us to come together and to do what we can to do the improvements our committee, our community, definitely fight for. So thank you for the birthday card. Renetta. It was beautiful. Someone else, I want to say something, but I just want to let the DSLAM lap song know September. We need to talk, have a speaker to talk about car a little all right, no problem who's, the person that just said something this English, it's Margaret I, was wondering how community members can get those email, announcements about programs and events, everything that we any all programs and events are posted on Facebook, Instagram and other community boards in this city. Maintain we'll talk offline about that, but really at this moment these are the three methods that we use. Okay, you're welcome, read district managers report good evening. Everyone can you all hear me? Yes, really we're gonna, see you properly. My laptop I can see you all very well we're gonna read some. How is disabled I'm not quite sure why? Okay, alright, so once again welcome everyone. I want to thank you for the hard work that you've been doing all year. It's unfortunate as Miss English says that we did not have our traditional outdoor meeting, nor our health fair or our participation in the LDL LGBT queue and I parade. Hopefully, next year will be able to do so. I'd like to welcome our new to our new members of the board, the burmeister and comm I. Believe the name is, if I pronounced it incorrectly, please feel free to make that correction. I welcome you I have not had an offer to actually meet you, but I will be in communication with you over the summer. So I hope this is your first. Hopefully, you will attend many more I also would like to thank the board for helping to further the word along to the members of our community, who have suffered losses who have encountered food insecurities who have lost jobs, that you are there to support them in and whatever way that you possibly can I'm going to urge you to continue to do so, because it is very important while we are going to get out of this crisis- and we are I, ask you to hang on and also again be encouraging to your neighbors friends and family, it's critically important, so that we can successfully get through this I've had questions and regard to the youth programs, whether or not there is going to be a youth services program this summer. It is on the table that City Council, as you may know, it is still being negotiated. So I don't have any confirmation as to whether or not view services programs will happen at the moment. Anyway. However, there are volunteer programs for our young people. Please contact the office to inquire about that. Their volunteered, unfortunately not paid jobs, but it is an opportunity for young people to acquire experience. I also like to take this opportunity to thank Miss Renetta English, who has done an outstanding job. Do you all agree with me, [Applause] dooty, absolutely so. I personally want to thank you and also thank you on behalf of the board as well. She has gotten us through this whole difficult crisis like having our meetings on. You know, teleconference by a video, and the majority of our members have been able to sign on and participate, not only in the board meeting, but committee meetings as well, so I also commend you, but thank her for bringing us into the 21st century. Also I'd like to take the opportunity to acknowledge members of the board who have or will celebrate birthdays this month and next month. So I would like to say: congratulate pesantren Gandhi, Kevin, Hughes ADIZ, look Perez and Pat Thorpe. They are celebrating or celebrating their birthdays this month and because we are not meeting in July in advance, I'd like to congratulate Ralph, Marino and Joyce Julian, all of them by the way, have reached the rifles age. 21. Also I just want to give you an update about a few of the members of our board starting off with Ralph Moreno. He is still thriving and doing well as well as mr. Jimmy, Smith and very good news. Jairo Rodriguez is recovering and he is now in rehabilitation at Regal height, so we definitely will be seeing him at our next board. Meeting in September, so I'm very happy to report that.

Yes, we can. Okay, we had was a hearing with the Emeril group Susie, a developer of the property once will 51 Northern Boulevard with the Blasi site, and they had a I guess from what I could pick up, because I get on the site little bit well, 30 minutes late! For, however, the water centers appeals did not come to a conclusion on the site. They want more information from tamiya architects because of the lack of clarity and because the drawings will work insufficient and incomplete, based on their presentation and as far as I'm concerned, I. Think it's going to be a new. A new presentation will be presented in September second time. Yes, the CFA was not happy with him and they're planning to address it a little further in terms of the project. However, they did the architect in fact, SpaceX's building roughly 22 stories, but yet gonna be 337 feet in height, which means that all not all more than all the things right, they will be gap between up the increased area between floor to floor, but remains would be thing in the name for the jet down the road. All right, Thank, You, family and I really appreciate a community board. 3 was really represented at that meeting, so thank you and Wesley Thank You mr. Chaudhary Thank You, mr. Reed and ham with for testifying I should Nell was there Lorinda was there Who am I missing, am I missing anyone, mister okay, in a second who was there, you know? Yes, mr. Gideon I apologize. Yes, he was there. So if anyone else, please excuse me if I, if I forgot your name, but you were community board, three was well represented and I. Thank those for doing a wonderful presentation. And again there were no designs, so that's an oboe another could I comment. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. As Renetta just said, they gave the Bureau of Standards and appeals the same runaround that they gave the community board that they gave standing together on principle group. They do not have their act together. They are pinning their hopes and I think they want to assume that the whole process is the FAA letter which they made clear is part of the process. So the chair was very good. She said you need to communicate with the community and get their buy-in. I. Think we're well beyond that. We didn't say that, but there was a lot of patience demonstrated by the committee. So it's a it's an ongoing process as Hamlet indicated. Thank you. Thank you. Ed I, just like quickly just a few sentences, Marta about parks, I, don't know I know you may not have been prepared to say anything but Marta. Would you like to say about parks as we're going to phase two? Do you have anything or did Jessica mention at all? Yes, in regards to parks, it was a yeah they're, an advisory meeting attended virtually with the Alliance and they talked about the parks being opened that the budget for the Alliance and a lot of the projects have been stalled. There's no programming in the parks in Phase, two, the playgrounds are gonna, be opened. If you watch them, the news you saw, the playgrounds locks were being cut and people were using them, but Phase two, the playgrounds will be open, but there will be no team sports still practice your social distancing in the parks and wear your masks. That's something that a lot of people are not doing, which is not wearing a mask, and you know when you go into a lot of places, they will expect you to have a mask or you will not get service all right. Thank, You, mark education, Lisa, miss alum to say a few words. Yes, all right. So, very briefly, there are a few youth programs and you, a lot of them were geared towards kovat and actually they say hearted areas and they keep in say in Corona one three, six eight. So one of them is the neon summer program that will provide participants and their all ages 14 to 24. It's with employment readiness, career exploration, mentorship, social and civic leadership, arts and creative expression, virtual reality and financial literacy, and at six to eight weeks, remote of course, and then there's something called each woman teach one which is actually going to pay you to design media messages and campaigns to promote social, distancing and ways to sit stay. There's also gonna be townhall meetings for the youth in different boroughs, I. Believe, though, in Queens, it's gonna be the Rockaways, but you could check this all out on the government site and but again, if you have a problem with that and want me to send you anything. Just email me put my email in the chat because I got this information from different places, because the one last thing is: it's called community rapid crisis response initiative and it gives grants that will support youth serving nonprofits, a community-based organization and continuing their work in engaging youth and young adults and lead and lead relief efforts of communities during the Covid-19 19 crisis. So a lot of them say that you have to qualify and when the qualifications is to be in a certain area when I clicked on it mentions Corona, that's a non Community Board. So if you want more information, please email me. It's much easy. If you email me, then for me to send you cuz I did get it in different places, but it was mostly the government on the government site so but I'll put my email just in case okay. Thank you. Thank you comment on education. The there was a city citywide resolution that the school districts did not want the police in their schools anymore. They were not going to renew the contract that did not pass all right. Thank you. So much all right. Traffic and transportation give the report. You can go ahead. Okay, so we met on Monday, June 1st, as it says in the report with Jason the deputy Queens borough, commissioner and Zach. They were discussing Northern Boulevard they're, going to be putting pedestrian islands on 71st, 73rd, 75th, 97th and 112 Street. We also discussed the open streets program is taking place on 34th Avenue between 69th Street and junction Boulevard and 85th Street between 30th and 25th Avenue, next to Gorman Park as they're continuing throughout the Covid-19 crisis. They didn't have any information about it, then, and they listened to some concerns from the community and they were discussing the possibility of putting an open street on any style, noodle industry between 23rd and 25th avenues, but I haven't heard a thing needs anything with that. Next, the land, the last report and then we'll go into our representatives will began out and it's going to read a letter that go ahead and it's something that was discussed with our Executive Board a few days ago and something that went out and she'll discuss it. Now you can hear me: yes, I can go ahead and hold on for a second everybody go ahead and you came back in again. Go ahead. Are you in try now? No we're not here she's frozen on a strainer. She might have to go out and come back in yeah. That's what I told her you, while I'm waiting for Anne to come back in I'm taking screenshots of everybody. So if you have your camera off, please turn it off. We wait for Anne to come back in all righty I'm trying to get these screen shots done. It's good to see. Everybody look good. Give me an O. Okay, I know the whole thing. Just froze I'm, not sure what happened all right, I just wanted to say, hi to everybody. It's sad to see you guys. I hope you guys are having much of a summer. You possibly can't have and like Renetta said: I want to just meet some quick climate, quick comments and did some updates I want to say that I guess. We all know that trim gonna be opened at a ribbon-cutting last week and I haven't seen it, but apparently I. Please mute that person and sorry it's so there was a ribbon-cutting last week and I said I course I haven't seen it I haven't done any traveling, but I did go to youtube and I happened to see. You know what it sort of looks like and I saw. There was a beautiful art exhibit over there. So I'm hoping you know, we all can get a chance to see if there's some time when we start traveling again. I also want to make a comment, so that was on a zoom meeting of the LaGuardia committee of the New York around table last night and they had a presentation by Delta, Airlines, JetBlue, American and the TSA, and you know it was sort of all them sort of agreed that you know the traveling industry has, you know really tremendously been impacted and it's gonna be a long road. You know true recovery, but you know what was interesting and that was glad to hear there's sort of a common thread from everybody that presented that you know they're really concerned with customer safety and making the passenger experience really less stressful, and just some of the comments that I just want to just note that I sort of took down yesterday. You know everybody is talking about plenty of sanitizer you're talking about mass wearing masks, you have to wear masks, not only a passenger but also the employees and gloves. If you have a mask. You know this video, give your masks and apparently they're continually just wiping down any touch points or anything do they think you may be touching all that stuff is continuously being wiped down. Delta had mentioned the rep from Delta said that you know they're boarding from the back from the back to the front and I guess that's the four key you knew from past each other. You know on the plane there's a lot of floor marking, which you know promotes the social distancing and there's sort of have you scanned your own boarding pass. So you don't have to pass it to someone and they pass it back to you sort of like do it and a lot of you know downloading apps, I'm sure, that's gonna, you know save a whole lot of time and so a lot they have a prepackaged snack packs. You know they're not serving you food like they normally would so. They'll have a prepackaged, you know snacks, were they having this nice with water sanitizers, whatever that may be, and I mean I came away. The takeaway was that they're really working hard just to make you know traveling, you know safe again and I was advisor, like whatever your what you traveling to out of. Let's go to the individual websites and just sort of see you know what genre farmers from each airport, but it was really was a good meeting and I really like hearing all those things that they were doing. I also want to mention that at that meeting, I mean the earth train kind of a comet. One comic kinda came up and Andrew Brooks from FAA was there and he made an announcement. The environmental review process is still ongoing and they hope to release to the public, a draft always twenty-eight, and what's that dress it's published to the fortified, a review Peter. Yet you know where again you can make comments. They talked about holding workshop and hearings, but again that's making comments online, I'm, not sure if they're gonna have zoom meeting like everybody else is having zoom meetings, but the more I'm sure community board know about it. You know we'll make sure everybody else is aware of this information. So next, as Renetta was saying before I kind of sort that cutoff the next item, I do want to say up front that this is for informational. Only and no boating is required by the board and I wanted to inform full board that a community board. It was contacted by the guardians of flushing Bay to sign into a letter to the congressional leaders to admit, emit air train funding and the stimulus money that Governor Cuomo was seeking from Washington. As we know, I mean from the beginning. As far as we all know, the funding for this project was not to have been derived for any taxpayers money but supported by private investors. You know, without a doubt, you know we need redevelopment in New York, it's very important and Airport really needed. You know to be redevelopment and I think once that your what is finished, it's gonna be absolutely fabless. So in the interest of time and getting this letter sent in a timely manner, he's making a committee met and unanimously voted to sign and to support the letter by the guardians of the bait, along with all the other organizations, was said to all congressional leaders in New York and New Jersey, with a CC to our local elected officials. Again this is information only no further boat. It is necessary tonight, if you can just give me like five minutes. I really would like to read the letter that we were talking about and the letter is dated: May 29, 2020, Durham's of the New York and New Jersey congressional delegations, guardians of blushing, Bay, respectfully request that Congress rejected New, York, New, Jersey, port authority's request for funding for the misguided proposal, water, your ear training project due to the precipitous drop in toll collection and ridership. The Port Authority has requested three billion dollars in special bailout funds to pursue its capital investment plans. While some of this funding may be critical to stabilize Port Authority operations, no funding should be provided to the AirTrain. The aerotrain is an unnecessary burn duel that will hamper economic recovery in our watershed, a region in northern Queens that has been heavily impacted by public 19 even before at the Kovach 19 crisis, transit experts planners and environmentalists and local residents. Believe the AirTrain was a mistake. The circular route would require riders to travel west from Manhattan to CityVille only to double back east of the airport. Many found that existing subway and plus options already offered the sought-after 30-minute ride to the airport, not to mention that the number seven train could not handle the expected influx in capacity construction of this backwards. Air train is now estimated across more than two billion dollars. The route would obstruct a significant portion of the historic World's, Fair, marina promenade, and hinder Bay visibility and park access in East Elmhurst, a MIG 807 3500, open space wait an nor our meeting has not ended yet, but if you have to drop off is totally understandable, but normally at this time we may have been still meeting the school. So June is normally a longer meeting. So I'd like to answer it to complete her the letter and we'll continue with the medium we're almost over okay yeah. Can we can we get you send this letter? We wanted to be ready. Thank you go ahead and please, with air traffic 97% in rail ridership down 9th is 95 percent. It is time to wholly rethink traffic hazard and travel in the region. The way that the pandemic is reverberating in our watershed is a warning for the impact that any environmental crisis would have in vulnerable communities where resilience equitably, equitable accessibility to resources and environmental qualities have not been prioritized. The weight of the initial impact of Kovach 19 is not an opportunity to force through pet projects. This is a moment to prioritize community resilience and transit equity. The Federal Aviation Administration is in the midst of an environmental impact review of the air train and has not yet approved it. Given the dramatic change and projected ridership, all alternatives must be reconsidered, and assumptions underlying the analysis revisit simply put the air train is not ready for primetime and should not be funded by a congressional bailout when it's become clear in recent days. Is that, although better alternatives for the project exist, the air train is driven by politics, not transit, planning and community engagement. Forget your transit experts. Governor Cuomo employs insisting that he be given the ability to over one the opposition from the communities that are now bearing the brunt of Kovach, 19, scrounge and suffering economic devastation. There's no better time to build than right now the communities of College, Point, Corona and East Amherst flush and Jackson Heights that were the epicenter of kovat 19 cases need funding now to keep our neighbors in their home and stay small businesses, restaurants and retail. We do not need funding for speculative vanity projects. Financial assistance to the Port Authority may be appropriate, but funding for the AirTrain is not we sweet. We respectfully urged you to explicitly omitted funding for the AirTrain from any economic stimulus that allocate money to Port Authority, yours, respectfully, Rebecca prior program, coordinated guardians of flesh and bait the support from- and there was a number of organization that signed on to this and again it went out to all the New York New Jersey congressional leaders, with CC to all over electric Thank You Renetta or an annex the question. Yes, you can I'm just wondering how we sign on to something without a full board vote. Oh well, I can afford that I think what I was gonna say: I'm sure that there's how many people on this meeting right now and we all sit on different boards and we all sit on executive MIDI, and we all know that the executive committee has authority to call meetings as it seemed deemed necessary and report back to the floor board, know it that is correct, but the exactly the committee from my understanding for my bylaws doesn't have the authority to vote on something for the full board. This is not a letter. This is a letter that you were asked to sign up on and it was voted upon an executive committee and it was of timely time off the essence to be sent out and vote was made and it was sent out and we and we all voted upon it and the community boards name was added to it, and it's not only based upon the fact of also based upon the numerous workshops that we've had as blasts as Ward 3 and the response that we've gotten from members and those in the community. This is why, as an executive board, we voted the way that we did to place community board threes name on this letter. Exactly okay go ahead. No everything was done, as you know, as we are required to do so. The executive committee did come together, but I think I, think and we're reading that letter, but I think that we should move ahead because I think that there are agencies that would like to also a report at our reading, and can you just note what eight other organizations signed on I was looking I think I do have it, but my phone died. I was trying to find the dates of stuff and the names of the organization. They were ornament. There was other organization, I don't want to miss. You know miss state, something, that's not true! That can't read right now. My phone and I state, the fournette signed on I know that, as Frank said, get more signed on I believe it was Co good night AK, Ovid 19 group in the area, and there was a one or two more together. We can so was Kovac care network together weekend. It Mars and all right. Thank you. So much all right. Our president's report I think Lisa put something here in the chat and I'll just read it very quickly. Everyone because I know it's a longer meeting tonight. This does anybody see here in the chat Lisa's? Let me see you talked about I'll, look down and I'll find it, but who's next on it, I found it Renetta I'll read it Queens borough presidents recruit to know about the Queens borough. Presidents, recruitment, fair on June 24th at 2 p.m. Joe. Wanted you to know about the Queens borough, the Queens borough, presidents, Philippine Independence Day event, which is on June 24th as well. At 5:00 p.m. and the Queens borough president's celebration of Jerusalem event, which is on June 25th at 5:00 p.m. and, if you want more information, you can go to WWE as PP org all right. Thank you. Kevin and I'd also like to see. If the CCRB are you still on, we got a quick announcement. They wrote into the chat that one quickly, just a few cents, I'll see if I can find it. If you want to do somebody else, oh wait, I think I found it. Okay, all right this is this is from Morra Riggi outreach coordinator at the civilian complaint Review Board evening, everyone, as you may know, the CCRB is a city agency independent from the New York Police Department that investigates immediates complaints against NYPD officers in a neutral and unbiased manner. The CCRB investigates allegations of excessive force abuse of authority, thus courtesy and offensive language. The CCRB office located at 100 Church Street New York New York's, will be closed until further notice, but the agency will continue across as complaints of police misconduct remotely civilians may file a complaint online by visiting their website, WWN ycg, Aubert, / CCRB, or by calling 1-800 three four one. Two seven two four call 3-1-1. If you would like more information on the city's response to come up in 1980, gov board, / coronavirus, sorry, somebody just posted something and it moved all right to reach out to Maura Ricky about the ccr bees upcoming board meeting. Her email is M as a Mary. Ours and Robert is an igloo. She has a George. H is an Howard. I is an igloo at CC RV, that's Charlie, Robert, Bob, DOT nyc.gov, all right! Thank you. George hi I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. Congrats to the new board members, mr. Baumeister and calm. Also, we are making hand sanitizer and face mask deliveries, email or call I put it in the chat and yeah we're. You feel free to Paul I mean our office is closed on tomorrow, June teeth, but if you're dead, if you or someone you know is in desperate need, please that's all I got. Thank you very much. Thank you. James very quickly. James, okay yeah. We got a new reports. One of the reports is the end of claims report. So the city paid out less in tort. Claims and law claims complete compared to the last two fiscal years, the NYPD with the source of the of 36 percent or the reason for 36 percent of the tort claim payouts. That's the most, that's the that's the agency, that's responsible for the biggest payoff, and but that number declined compared to the last two years of trending in the right direction. We also have the city quarterly cash report and cash balance protection report right now. Those numbers really only reflect things up to the end of March. Can we see the impact : 19 -? Clearly in the numbers, the thing is, we're still doing any workshops. You can find that on our website, that's for minority-owned business enterprises there's some tips about how to get financing how to kick start your business. You know the webinars are free and they're open to anyone. There's also information that it would be useful for people who don't fit those identity categories and, lastly, the comptroller's office put out a proposal for 1.1 billion dollar defunding of the NYPD over the course of four years, and it involves shifting a lot of enforcement priorities similar to some things that I think Jessica sent from the mayor's office, and if you want to see that it's also on the website, alright, thank you, James Lilly yeah. Can you hear me? Can you hear me I good evening? Everyone? Well, let me just say this much. Nothing stopped the New York State Legislature during kovat, under the leadership of Assemblyman Audrey, the State Assembly was able to review a police reform pass and move forward with that to present to the governor some of the bills in that, with a repeal of 50, a false 9-1-1 complaints, the right to monitor act, medical attention for persons under arrest, and the list goes on. Also a bill that assemblyman Aubrey sponsored and was passed is a 105 one 7, which requires the Department of Health to conduct a study on health impacts of COBIT 19 on minorities in New, York State. That bill is very close to heart because most of our communities suffered tremendously. So when you ask what do they do they make New York a better place so with that I would like to say on behalf of our office and the member happy Father's Day to all. Thank you so much for never you're doing a great job have a good night. Thank you! So much Lily Michelle Hernandez from Congress woman's office, hi everyone very quick update. They shared some stuff about the census and our office operations in the chat box, but a high-level legislative updates include the congressman introduced a bill to prohibit the use of tear gas by law enforcement. It is illegal to use in military, and so it should be illegal to use against civilians. The congresswoman also co-sponsored the justice and policing Act of 2020, which is the House and Senate Democrats response to the calls to address police brutality and then, lastly, for a legislative update. The commerce women voted to support the Paycheck protection flexibility Act, which is making improvements on the PPP program in general and last item that I wanted to share with you are, is that we are happy to note that this week our office hit a milestone and opening our 1000th case for constituents of the 14th congressional district. Approximately 80% of them are immigration cases and we also work on a friendly reminder on Social Security issues of Veteran Affairs issues of postal office IRS.

Michelle Kuban, hi, the Kievan home, comes amid brahms losses to be prime month and happy routines everybody. So he was mentioned earlier that the first moratorium on eviction is ending this week on June 20th, although he was extended to August 20th, but it did not include the whole proceedings, so we may anticipate mass petitions in the housing port by then.

In the meantime, we also can our constituents with legal nonprofit partners for services. So if you know you or anybody needs any assistance, please feel free to reach out and for restaurant owners who are interested in setting up outdoor seating.
