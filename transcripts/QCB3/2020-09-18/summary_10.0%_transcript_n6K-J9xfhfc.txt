I'd like to welcome everyone to the queen's community board number three September meeting we haven't met in the past two months: And we're going to open up our meeting with the roll call.
As I mentioned earlier, under after 115 precinct, we'll have a presentation from the department of homeless, services, anaika ibis aloft, hotels, When we begin our meeting, we begin with public participation.
Okay, so you'll type, your questions in the chat area, all right, so I'd, like to our first speaker for public information, is reverend manuel de josus rodriguez from our lady of sorrows.
He wanted to introduce himself to the community and if he comes on a little later before the end of public participation, we'll bring him back on again, but I don't see him.
We hear your complaints and we've been focusing a lot on enforcement, along with the bars speaking with the bars and the restaurant owners, to try to get compliance with the music, but also moving cars along that are coming to the area that are not necessarily residents that are bringing large crowds in front of these locations and music's their own speakers and they're, taking over parking lots at this point, I'll open up for some questions.
00 That's due to the increase in 911 calls not necessarily complaints at this time, but when we get the 911 calls from the community and we're able to look back at our cameras that we have there too, but we will would like more.
During the protest that I've attended, there have been, you know, like huge numbers of police officers, present, you know, And, I'm wondering you know and at the same time a lot of crime is increasing in other parts of the city.
Initially, when we did have the you know the protests going on a few months ago, when things were at times pretty violent, I myself was sent down to soho during the looting with a bunch of my officers from here.
The amount of sound coming from that area in sector david I have members of the community telling me that you know just like you brought up.
The staff patterns look like security and then obviously we'll take questions from the community, but I do want to give nika the opportunity to introduce themselves Then I will have someone from nike just sort of explain a little bit about nika as an age as a non-profit altogether in the work that they do.
That includes the community board, the elected official, the precinct, any businesses or any faith-based organizations that gives them an opportunity to address any issues and concerns that may affect the community and as well, learn more about our services and provide updates on residents that are moving out and living back, independently, so and jump in really quickly.
You know, share individuals that they think are appropriate for the site, but we will, you know, work with you all and identify folks that can be on the cab.
And I did want to give you know a sort of presentation or share the operation that the shelter you know what's going on at the site, We were using the marriott hotel, For I believe it was three years prior that we had three years prior to this, this site.
The population is general population, meaning these individuals either are employed or looking for employment, or you know, seeking some sort of permanent housing.
A lot of our clients are out of work, but I still think that's a great percentage given during given what you know the country is going through the during the global pandemic, so 40 percent of the clients are employed.
So I do want to talk a little bit about what a day to day looks like at the site when an individual first arrives at the site, they're meeting with the operations staff to conduct a new residence orientation and go through the good neighbor policy after they complete the initial intake.
The staff nica is reiterating this information to the clients that they need to abide by the good neighbor policy that all of that stuff happens within 24 hours of the individual, getting referred to the site after that they are meeting with their caseworker for goals and setting me they're meeting with their caseworkers and setting goals right, whether this individual might need to enroll in public assistance, If, there's other linkages and stuff that the site can't provide for them.
So these individuals, the men residing at the site, will work with again the employment special to either obtain housing.
You know provide on-site, so the types of referrals that we sometimes make are housing, employment, schooling, trade, medical, mental health, substance, abuse, etc.
I do want to give the opportunity for ricardo, because this is the work that he really did on the ground to go out into the community and make these linkages and make these connections so we're able to refer our clients to them.
We always do a canvas of the community to take the opportunity to utilize the community-based organizations that surrounds the site that provides an array of services such as substance, abuse, alcohol, abuse, mental health, even a general health care provider that can provide simple tests like ppd or any other test.
So if any other community board members may know of any other programs, that could be beneficial for our residents.
So I do want to get to those, but I do want to talk a little bit in addition to the other work that nika is doing on site with these clients.
In addition to you, know, meeting with their caseworkers and their housing specialists and employment, specialists, nike is providing workshops and stuff for the clients to participate on site.
So in those housing, meetings, they're going over this information, whether it be the good neighbor policy or speaking with clients about workshops and other things that they have to offer them and speaking with the clients, if there's anything that they can refer them.
You know progress into the community and if they need any extra needs or anything like that, we're able to provide that to them.
I. Don't know if you participated in that in that meeting, but I will say that if we, if you guys, are seeing individuals in the community that you know are due engaging in those sort of activities that you're describing, we would encourage you to reach out to us either via you know the 24 hour line or an email or even myself, you can always contact.
If that individual is a resident of ours, and if they are, we will figure out either will case conference them or figure out a site that might be better for them, but we will certainly share a contact information for everyone on this call to have if there are concerns about what they believe to be our clients.
We, will, like, I said, start a community advisory board meeting for this site, but I think you know hearing from residents in real time.
I do want nika to talk a little bit about you, know, sort of the patrol or security.
So in short, I just wanted to know if there were plans to acquire space in the a-lot hotel, in addition to the site that we're using no there's, not nika Will only operate out of the ibis hotel, now.
You know we are looking to open, Shelters and we've been opening shelters all across new york city in every kind of neighborhood.
It's something about community boards that don't have sites and, as I've, been as I've said, before, we're looking to open shelters in those communities.
We've operated homeless, shelters in residential neighborhoods in communities that have no transportation similar to yours, right where the transportation is just buses and stuff like that.
And, like we did mention you know, nika, is the social service provider on site providing services.
So the majority of the clients are able to seek their services that they need on site, but we're also trying to create an environment where these individuals are going out into the community and seeking other services that they need, because that when they leave the shelter system, they're not going to have services, they're going to have to go out and find those services.
So the services, then the linkages and the referrals that ricardo found you know, might not be right next to the shelter, but they very are close to the site that we're operating and again.
You know, I mean we want to work with the community.
We can share what we're doing on site, whether it's moving folks into permanent housing, the services that we're providing.
So part of the turning the tide plan is again like I mentioned: open, 90, new shelters, 90, new, high quality, shelters and kind of, and close out all these cluster sites that we're using the borough of Queens We want to close out commercial hotels.
And they're not able to get a job, and we would We And we recognize you know the importance of being in your community.
Can we do to welcome our new neighbor Think there are many things that we can do to like work with you guys and create a better partnership, and you know things you guys can do to welcome these individuals, whether it's care packages, I'm, happy to speak directly with you after this call or offline about what that could sort of look like in brainstorm.
Obviously you know these individuals will be in this community, for you know some time And we want to make it work for you guys, How long do you intend to use the ibis or ibis as a shelter like what?
So it would be like any neighbor in your community that comes into your neighborhood.
I have some people that don't have an apartment or living place, but they're looking for the job So, that's actually like a lot of our clients who enter the shelter system.
As you all know, is very expensive and finding actual affordable housing is almost impossible, but so what we will do and our providers will do- is they'll work with each individual to secure a voucher.
So, most individuals who exit the shelter system will exit with a voucher, meaning the city will pay a portion of their rent and they will be responsible for covering the rest of their rent in order for them to qualify that for that they have to have an open public assistance case They have to be continuously working with their case workers to prove that they are eligible for it.

I would like to personally thank the community board number three members, the u.s census, new york city, census.
They were able to sign up numerous members of the committee of the community because our numbers were down in east elmhurst and north corona for self-response.
As you see all today for the homeless, shelter, the new one that we didn't know about, they did come and present within us They do want to work with the community.
There's, other issues that are going on in the community that we will be addressing in regards to open streets.
I was really concerned because our numbers in east elmhurst and north corona, the self-response, were under 50 percent, but our numbers have gone up as the enumerators have been walking the streets of our neighborhood and the numerous community events, and I'm happy to report And You'll see that there's a report from city planning related to the census.
Thank, you all for coming out just to let you know that we had this evening, 71 participants, so I'm very happy that we are getting the word out about the our meetings and that the community is getting getting more involved with the board and becoming familiar with all the concerns and issues.
In addition to that, we've been working to support a lot of small businesses with our open restaurants, program.
So on the congressional side, we are being very careful in terms of not being you know, not congregating, a lot of people because, as it is right, now, we're still seeing high numbers in certain areas, especially in our community.
I just want to let everyone know that, and please tell us to other people too you're able to file a claim through the comptroller's office, to ask for compensation for damage incurred to your property, whether it be a motor vehicle parked on your property or on the street or a fence, or your house like, for example, I, know in our neighborhood.
