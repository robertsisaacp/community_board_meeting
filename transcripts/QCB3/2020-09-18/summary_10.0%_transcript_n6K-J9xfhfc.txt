Where it says, DOH is DHS department of homeless services, so you can just make that change under 115Th Precinct is DHS and Nika Ebus aloft, hotels, And I put an updated agenda in your folder.
It's DHS, not DOH, caller number one All right is the NYPD on Hi Keisha I'd like to welcome everyone to the queen's community board number three September meeting.
As I mentioned earlier, under after 115 precinct, we'll have a presentation from the department of Homeless Services Anaika ibis aloft, hotels, all right, so it was not DOH.
So you'll type, your questions in the chat area, all right, so I'd like to our first speaker for public information, Is Reverend, Manuel, De, Josus Rodriguez from our lady of sorrows.
He wanted to introduce himself to the community and if he comes on a little later before the end of public participation, we'll bring him back on again, but I do not see him here.
We hear your complaints and we've been focusing a lot on enforcement, along with the bars speaking with the bars and the restaurant owners, to try to get compliance with the music, but also moving cars along that are coming to the area that are not necessarily residents that are bringing large crowds in front of these locations and music's their own speakers and they're, taking over parking lots at this point, I'll open up for some questions.
So captain along 94th and 95th street We've had a persistent problem with ongoing drug dealing and the associated violence and we're wanting what we as a community can do to help you curb this violence, especially since.
That's, due to the increase in 911 calls not necessarily complaints at this time, but when we get the 911 calls from the community And You know we'll take any information we can because we're using it for an ongoing investigation into that area.
They did that in an effort to create more available manpower on the weekends and that's hopefully going to help keep the police officers assigned to the 115 precinct here in the 115 precinct for the majority, you know as often as possible as far as how often it happens.
Initially, when we did have the you know the protests going on a few months ago, when things were at times pretty violent, I myself was sent down to Soho during the looting with a bunch of my officers from here.
David I have members of the community telling me that you know just like you brought up.
Thank you, and if you want to type your information in the chat, you can captain put my email in there too I just I was going to get piggyback on what Frank was saying, because I kind of experienced over the fourth of July, with the fireworks, and I, found it interesting.
Somebody will come out with getting complaints, but I also call 3, 1- 1, and my question is, if I'm putting in a complaint, Because it says the police has responded, so those three minutes and a lot of them were under 10 minutes in from the time the person reported and it being closed, out.
As far as your community, though, and up there in that sector, we're going to con, You know you have two shootings there this year here , That location, is, I would say, for the precinct violence- wise, it's second to nine five street, or it's in nine five in that location, That's a lot, especially you know, since their families that live there, elderly that live in the building and those residents do not even live in the room.
Thank you for having me I'll work on every one of these issues at this time and the captain has posted his email address in the chat.
The staff patterns look like security and then obviously we'll take questions from the community, but I do want to give Nika the opportunity to introduce themselves Then I will have someone from Nike just sort of explain a little bit about nika as an age as a non- profit altogether in the work that they do.
We, work with rent carriers we reach out to the community and provide services and repairing their apartments, and so forth.
That includes the community board, the elected official, the precinct any businesses or any faith- Based organizations that gives them an opportunity to address any issues and concerns that may affect the community and as well, learn more about our services and provide updates on residents that are moving out and living back, independently, so and jump in really quickly.
You know, share individuals that they think are appropriate for the site, but we will, you know, work with you all and identify folks that can be on the cab And, we'll look to have one in October.
And I did want to give you know a sort of presentation or share the operation that the shelter you know what's going on at the site, We were using the Marriott Hotel, for I believe it was three years prior that we had three years prior to this, this site.
The population is general population, meaning these individuals either are employed or looking for employment, or you know, seeking some sort of permanent housing.
A lot of our clients are out of work, but I still think that's a great percentage given during given what you know the country is going through the during the global pandemic, so 40 percent of the clients are employed.
So I do want to talk a little bit about what a day to day looks like at the site when an individual first arrives at the site, they're meeting with the operations staff to conduct a new residence orientation and go through the good neighbor policy after they complete the initial intake.
We're happy to share what the Good neighbor policy is, but essentially it's asking the clients to you: know, be good citizens and not do things in the community that they would not want doing done in their own communities to treat this community like it's their own.
The staff Nica is reiterating this information to the clients that they need to abide by the good neighbor policy that all of that stuff happens within 24 hours of the individual, getting referred to the site after that they are meeting with their caseworker for goals and setting me they're meeting with their caseworkers and setting goals right, whether this individual might need to enroll in public assistance.
So these individuals, the men residing at the site, will work with again the employment special to either obtain housing.
If individuals, you know, are not able to receive a service on site.
I do want to give the opportunity for ricardo, because this is the work that he really did on the ground to go out into the community and make these linkages and make these connections so we're able to refer our clients to them.
We always do a canvas of the community to take the opportunity to utilize the community- based organizations that surrounds the site that provides an array of services such as substance, abuse, alcohol, abuse, mental health, even a general health care provider that can provide simple tests like Ppd or any other test.
So if any other community board members may know of any other programs, that could be beneficial for our residents.
We are open to ideas and suggestions and no one knows their community better than you, guys.
So I do want to get to those, but I do want to talk a little bit in addition to the other work that Nika is doing on site with these clients.
In addition to you, know, meeting with their caseworkers and their housing specialists and employment, specialists, Nike is providing workshops and stuff for the clients to participate on site.
Those are the things that we're talking about right and then, in addition to that, they're having housing meetings, every third Wednesday of the month, so in those housing, meetings, they're going over this information, whether it be the good neighbor policy or speaking with clients about workshops and other things that they have to offer them and speaking with the clients.
You know progress into the community and if they need any extra needs or anything like that, we're able to provide that to them.
I do not know if you participated in that in that meeting, but I will say that if we, if you guys, are seeing individuals in the community that you know are due engaging in those sort of activities that you're describing, we would encourage you to reach out to us either via you know the 24 hour line or an email or even myself, you can always contact.
If that individual is a resident of ours, and if they are, we will figure out either will case conference them or figure out a site that might be better for them, but we will certainly share a contact information for everyone on this call to have if there are concerns about what they believe to be our clients.
We, will, like, I said, start a community advisory board meeting for this site, but I think you know hearing from residents in real time.
I do want Nika to talk a little bit about you, know, sort of the patrol or security.
You know we are looking to open, Shelters and we've been opening shelters, all acrosss, New York City in every kind of neighborhood you could imagine, except for those places all right.
It's something about community boards that do not have sites and, As I've been as I've said, before, we're looking to open shelters in those communities.
And, we're looking to open, again, 90 and close out commercial hotels, but Those 90 sites we're looking to cite all acrosss the city, not just in your neighborhoods, all throughout New York, City.
We've operated homeless, shelters in residential neighborhoods in communities that have no transportation similar to yours, right where the transportation is just buses and stuff like that.
Nika is the social service provider on site providing services, so the majority of the clients are able to seek their services that they need on site, but we're also trying to create an environment where these individuals are going out into the community and seeking other services that they need, because that when they leave the shelter system, they're not going to have services, they're going to have to go out and find those services.
So the services, then the linkages and the referrals that Ricardo found you know might not be right next to the shelter, but they very are close to the site that we're operating and again.
You know, I mean we want to work with the community.
We can share what we're doing on site, whether it's moving folks into permanent housing, the services that we're providing.
Know, individuals coming to the shelter system are very reluctant to come in if they are not able to be in sheltered in their neighborhoods, which is why we started this borough- based plan.
Okay, quick follow- up what here in the neighborhood can we do to welcome our new neighbor Think there are many things that we can do to like work with you guys and create a better partnership, and you know things you guys can do to welcome these individuals, whether it's care packages, I'm, happy to speak directly with you after this call or offline about what that could sort of look like in brainstorm.
Obviously you know these individuals will be in this community, for you know some time And we want to make it work for you, guys, How long do you intend to use the ibis or ibis as a shelter like what?
So if they've completed their time and they do not have a place to live and the state was not able to set them up with some sort of housing, you know they would come into the shelter system.
So I just want to be really transparent about it, Well, if someone is- and if someone, if, as a comes into the community on in your shelter who is who is a convicted sex offender and they have to register as a sex offender.
So it would be like any neighbor in your community that comes into your neighborhood.
They just are not able to make ends meet because living in the city of New York, as you all know, is very expensive and finding actual affordable housing is almost impossible, but so what we will do and our providers will do- is they'll work with each individual to secure a voucher.
So, most individuals who exit the shelter system will exit with a voucher, meaning the city will pay a portion of their rent and they will be responsible for covering the rest of their rent in order for them to qualify that for that they have to have an open public assistance case They have to be continuously working with their case workers to prove that they are eligible for it.
You know like a work.
There you'll see the many services that we provide and also all of our sites and there's a phone number there and also an email address any issues and concern in addition to what I posted here, you also can reach out to the email and the phone number that is on the website.
Thank you so much department of homeless services, and we have your contact information, And I, know folks will definitely contact you.

I would like to personally thank the community board number three members, the U.S Census New, York, City census.
Every time we went out, we always had the Us and they were able to sign up numerous members of the Committee of the community because our numbers were down in East, Elmhurst and North Corona for self- response.

We, had new member training again, so Other issues that are going on in the community that we will be addressing in regards to open streets.
