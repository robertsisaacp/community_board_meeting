So I know everyone's already working hard, but I just wanted to share that we're still experiencing the litter problem there.
: Will the New York City Department of Environmental Protection conduct an air quality survey along 35Th, Avenue and side streets, considering the increase in vehicular traffic and idling times?
The first issue is just the litter and trash along 69th Street and the other issue is more complicated and that is that the BQE is dividing line between community Board, two and Committee Board, three right and the actual overpass areas.
Many people know that's an area where day, laborers congregate, there's some homeless people there, but there are some city-issued trash cans on that area, which we call the plaza.

You know what it is that you need to follow, and you know equivalent 19 continues to spread in New York City with concerning increases in community transmission.
In these certain neighborhoods and New York City is taking action by implementing restrictions in the zones that are identified by the state right.

Do you know a reminder that health and hospital sites in New, York, City and state sites should be free of charge for Kobe test, but some of the private locations do charge so before you go to get your tests, make sure to call, especially if it's a private organization that is giving the test to find out.
So we recommend on doing that all new yorkers should get tested regardless of symptoms or increased risk, and it's the best way to help stop the spread and protect our loved ones.
If you're going to see someone that might be more vulnerable and be at higher risk of getting Covid-19, you might want to make sure that you get tested so that you're, keeping that individual, safe and as we're talking about testing.
Antibody testing is currently available on a walking basis at 11, acute care facilities of New, York, City, Health and hospital and they're open to those who have not had copin 19 symptoms or positive kubin19 diagnostic tests.
You have not already you a the season usually starts around this time in the early fall, and we want to prevent you know: Facing, a twin endemic where you have a Kobe, 19 and influenza at the same time, so you know, and as well as making sure that we're not going to overwhelm our health care system.

Are these three items are something new that will be introduced to the budget, to upgrade the 90 street playground repair and replace the decorative pavement at Flushing Bay promenade.
We have a joint public hearing with land use, it's BSA calendar number, 2019, 18a1, Marina road, we're going to have the parks department, give their presentation and It's.
All right, your speaker is on Eric you're, open I work in the engineering department And I'm the project manager for the reconstruction of the world's fair marina.
We want to provide a secure, pier in Marina and dock areas, with amenities for fishing, event, charter boats and permittee boaters.
We requested a variance from certain requirements of Appendix G of New York City Building code, which is for flood resistant, construction.
Construction is to be located, seaward of the reach of mean in high water and the V zone and item two, the lowest portion of the horizontal lowest portion of the lowest horizontal structural member of the of the low sorry of the lowest member shall be above the design flood elevation.
This-is why we pursued the BSA variants and this variance is necessary for the proposed reconstruction of an existing concession structure that was located on pier 1, and we want to relocate that on the onto the new pier one, just a couple of slides here on Norville Project.
It is also to reconstruct the fixed portion of pier 3 and repair and replace the floating dots at pier 3 as well, and overall we are going to upgrade the site utilities at this facility.
This blue shaded area is the is the fixed pier that we are going to reconstruct, which includes a new ADA compliant aluminum gangway.
That's on the pier, currently upland and elevated, as per as per Appendix G Code, and we are going to repair and reconstruct a number of floating docks, including new guide.
We are aware of a report theory project, and we are coordinating with port authority to make sure that you know our jobs are integrated as best as possible.
I encourage our community board to support whatever is needed for the Parks Department and the marina to move.
I think it's a great resource for our community and thanks to everything that the Parks Department does to enhance our life here in our community, and then I just wanted to add that it seems that perhaps the area for canoes is smaller than the existing area.
We do widen out what is existing at pier one now from for the boaters, and there is, there is area for expansion as well in the future, as funding comes in all right.
Hi there I was wondering what the capacity of the current marina is, especially when compared to this new design, and if the you know, if it's, if it's being fully used, if it's at capacity now pier one in terms of like the number of books that are able to use the appear in the dock, pier one The new design, is, is reducing the capacity a little bit.
One currently is at full capacity, but you know during the reconstruction we will and The Parks Marina Team will.
Will you know, work with existing boaters at pier one to move them over to pure from the old here?
People get in good times, and the first thing they get rid of in bad times we're starting to see a lot more use during what everyone's been through this past summer, because it's kind of a socially distance people can get out, but I have not seen a lot of new acquisitions, so You know we'll be ready, for you know the future, but at this point I think the plan that we have really accommodates what we have now with a little room for growth.
Some upgrades at the site, As I mentioned, the concession structure and piers are, and peer structures are going to be resiliently built, for example.
The concession structure is going to be anchored into the into the new pier, so It won't float away during the a wind or flood load event The floating docks will be more resilient and and the guide piles for those flowing, docks will be taller than Fp1 will be taller, and some of them at p3 will also be taller at to make sure that the appears do not over top during a a really high tide, a really high storm, event, all right and go ahead and start coming.
You know that you would have to obviously determine the severity of the damage of any future storm or event And yeah, for example, Hurricane, Sandy or FEMA did come in and and provide some money to repair what was what was damaged as well as upgrade, which we are utilizing in this design, and how long did that take for damage in other parts of the city in regards to peers Did, not that take a long time to get the funding.
We'll go on to the fourth applicant, and hopefully we can get the third one by then It's going to be shambhala, Vegetarian, Restaurant, Corp, doing businesses, Failu Shambhala, Restaurant, 7219, Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson, Heights, Application wine and beer license representative The hour will be 11 to 11 to 12 o'clock, seven days a week, so the restaurant will not open it.
I, call for a motion to adopt our agenda, all in favor I'd, like capital and expense chairs, to come, on, and I'm going to show my screen You will be focusing on this area right here.
It's, and it's in need of repair, also to reinstate bathrooms located at the Flushing bay promenade, also to remove the what was formerly number 15, which was providing funds for the bus pad which, as vanetta stated, the D.O.T told us we, Give me a second If you can go add your question sure my question is: is on the capital.

We met reported that the Merchants Association is having a food distribution.

If you're not going in to vote, if you are- Or, you have an absentee ballot, you can bring your absentee ballot to the site to the dropbox and there was no need for involving the postal service because there's a little concern of insecurity in that way.
