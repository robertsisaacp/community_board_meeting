So you can see what we'll be doing tonight. We will open with public participation, but no one signed up for public participation, so we will not be doing that. We will open up with borough chief azera, who is the department of sanitation's new borough, chief, all by Anna Schatz from the Department of Health and she's, going to be focusing on Covid-19. As you can see, there's been an uptick around the city. We have two public hearings tonight, our fiscal year, 2022 capital and expense budget and board members. You received all of this material in your folder, followed by a land, use, slash parks, joint public hearing and we have parks here today. Then we have edmund rosenbaum for business echo. We have about four applications. I know one of the applicants they're in the room right now followed by our executive session, all right. So I'm going to take this away for now and I'm going to turn it over to Kevin Hughes who's, our secretary and he's just going to do the roll call and then we'll have our public information speakers. Okay, all right! Tom, Blatta Tom! Are you here all right: Ann Brown, Elbow, Bundia Elba! I know I saw you in there: okay yeah, I gotcha Mark Burmester, I'm here Mr Chowdhry!

We are at 28 capacity, two above quorum. All questions must be submitted via the chat window. If you need to find the chat, if you just move your mouse you'll see on the side where there's a little thought bubble on the right side of the top of your screen, a little chat bubble, you click. That is where you will put your questions. If you have questions for speakers and they will be either read to the speaker or the speaker will address them individually, I will be using the mute button. The master mute button throughout the course of the meeting. If we have any background noise going on, that is interfering with the meeting to unmute yourself. You just have to unmute yourself. So that is very easy. You can unmute yourself if you are a speaker and you've been master, muted. Okay, I will do my best to try and unmute the speakers if we have to do a master mute, but that is it is that it renetta yeah and Kevin. Maybe what we'll do whoever types their question in the chat? They'll just call out that particular person and then they can verbally ask their question and then you can help me so that then we could have muted them, because I think that's what we did last month to make sure there's not too much background noise. Does that work yeah that works great yeah. So then, when we get to the Q&A portion you I will, I will call out people's names. You will unmute yourself and you will ask your question of the speaker all right and is there anyone that may have just come in that missed their name in the roll call. I have a about. Half of the board is not present, and so I assumed there were a few people that may have popped in while we were talking anyone that was not here for roll call. That is a board member. Yes, Mr Holliday! Yes, I already marched yeah. No, I marked you as possible. Thank you. Anyone else, any other board members that need to be added to the roll call. Okay, rene, that's all you all.

We welcome you to our area and we look forward to working with you. Thank you Giovanna. I want to thank you. I want to thank you for remember. Javana is she's here. Also so she'll talk in a few minutes, but go ahead. Excuse me ronetta. I want to thank you for hosting me tonight introducing me I look forward to working with the Community board. I am a lifelong resident of Queens born and raised in Ridgewood, I'm very familiar with community Board 3.. I've worked there in other titles in the last 21 years of my career, I'm going to do everything in my power to try and work through the budget crisis. However, as you know, our hands are sometimes tied and some service delays will happen. There have not been very many during coverage. We've had some issues, but for the most part it's been seamless, I'd be more than happy to take any questions. Johanna knows how to get in touch with me. She has all my information. I am available 24 7. and, like I said, I look forward to working with each and every each and every one of you all right. Everyone, if you have any questions for our new chief new borough chief, please pose it as it relates to sanitation, Margaret flanagan had a question I believe. Oh you answered it. Someone renetta wants to know what you're chief of your chief of newborn chief of Queens Margaret has a follow- up question margaret okay, you can go ahead. Margaret! Okay, thank you, hello. Everyone! Thank you! So much. We experience a lot of litter both from I think temporary parked vehicles and from wind blown litter from trash baskets along 69th street in the BQE corridor, and I know our sanitation staff is already working so hard. I really appreciate all they do. Ray Pasante has been paying a lot of attention to try to support the efforts, cleaning up the homeless encampments in the same area. So I know everyone's already working hard, but I just wanted to share that we're still experiencing the litter problem there if there's any other options to help solve that, it would be appreciated. Thank you for your thank you for your question. I do know the 69th street corridor very well homeless conditions. Have we had a little bit of shift on how we police them? You guys know that the NYPD is in is involved. We do work with homeless cleanups through DHS. Typically, a homeless cleanup will last an hour or two, and then we use the existing eight hour resource to address other needs. Litter conditions on 69th, Street, Litter basket service, any known, drop- off locations. We have some issues underneath some of the various trestles near the BQE. We do know the hot spots our district superintendent Passante is very good. I worked very closely with him for many years. He does bring a lot of attention to some of the needy areas and we do direct resources as much as possible. We have had some elected officials sponsor and give some money for additional basket service along Roosevelt, Avenue, 37Th Avenue, and you might see them overnight and in the early mornings anytime we have any additional resources shake loose. We do divert them to that area, continue to voice your concerns to the Community board, utilize, the 3- 1- 1. It is checked quite frequently and we you know we do get to it as much as possible. Okay, we we have two more time for two more questions. First is msg. You can unmute yourself and ask your question msg. It could be my about someone else. No, it's I'll ask the question: will the New York City Department of Environmental Protection conduct an air quality survey along 35Th, Avenue and side streets, considering the increase in vehicular traffic and idling times? Well? This is for this is the yes. This is the department of sanitation. So, oh sorry, okay, they can email the Community Board office with that question and that can be forwarded to the EP. Okay and okay. Then we'll not count that as one of our questions, frank, you have a question about Cleveland, it's Mr Chaudhary before him. Sorry, oh I'm sorry, Mr Choudry go ahead! Yes! Welcome to our our borough chip and from our Committee board. I have only a request, as you have taken over the church and 37Th Avenue corner of 73Rd street at least any of the sites needs a basket. Your trash can is that under your jurisdiction, because this is going to need it is so, are you asking me for an additional basket on that location, exactly 37th, Avenue and 73Rd street? Okay, all four all four corners, or is there a particular, no, basically the two corners where the market Baja, indian, supermarket and this side, one where the Delhi shop? These two is small. That could be small, but there were before they have been gone. Okay, we will replace the baskets our basket inventory right now is a bit on the low side. We are expecting a delivery, but I will I will see if I can get a couple of litter baskets and put them on the corner I'll make sure in front of the supermarket. The two supermarkets, you said I'll, be the one on all four corners. One is the in the corner of the supermarket another one: the daily shop. Okay, thank you very much. Mr. Are you familiar with our adopt- a- basket program? Are you one of the shop owners? No, I'm a community board member, oh okay, so we encourage the shop owners to participate in our adopt- a- basket, where they we give them the bags and they sort of bag the litter basket. And then you know they they tie the bags and they they leave it next to the basket, and then that way it might be able to sit there. So so for about eight hours or so and there's no, it does not create a litter condition. We bring them all the tools and the Dustpans and the and the brooms and a brand new wire basket. So one of my staff members will be approaching one of those two businesses if they would like to participate, it's not required. You know, there's no, there's no obligation, but we do encourage the community to get involved. Something like that is usually very successful and it does cut down the litter condition, and I know that there's a few other questions in regards to the litter baskets. If anybody has those questions, please submit it to Ms reed and she will go over each item with the borough chief, so Kevin any other unique questions. Frank had Frank had a question about clean up on Ditmar's boulevard: okay, Frank, yes, you're right! Okay, how are you how's everybody? First of all, congratulations on your promotion chief good to have you in the area. I'm glad that you're a lifelong resident. Also. My question pertains to Dick Mars Boulevard from 114Th to 100 street. We have uptick of garbage left on 31st drive by the entrance and also 114th in that area over there, where, if we have a fender bender, which we seem to have every other week, the garbage is left over there and no one is there to either collect it, clean it or, and it sits there for a while, also down by the homeless, shelter down by a hundred. We have a thing where the cars you know used to sit down there when we had the airport- and I thought because the airport is really non- existent right now that really slowed down, but it has not. That area is, you know unkept and everything else. You guys do anything with that. So what I'll do is, since you bring it to my attention, I will, I will add the area you're talking about near the entrance to the Van wyck over by Northern Boulevard 114Th Street in that area by the no sir I'm talking about over by Astoria boulevard or did Mars 114., okay, that entire stretch and our 31st park drive and also 20:27th avenue drive, but that 27th Avenue is not that bad. But 31st really gets bad okay, so we show the basically the borderline, Community Board one I will. I will definitely add that to some of our hot spots that we're going to check every night and we will address those conditions if you're telling me that it's going on it's falling on sort of a blind eye, I will definitely make that part of my daily check. It's not an issue at all. Thank you. That is appreciated. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Now, the last question before we move on is for Nullah Authority all right. Thank you! So much so for over 10 years I and my family before as a past president of the Jack Science publication group, and now just a citizen, have been working to try to keep 69th street clean and I have failed miserably. There are a bunch of issues. There is dumping of garbage. There are people cleaning out their cars and throwing trash, there's a fact that there are no trash cans and there's a strip of land that no one takes care of, and over the years I figured out that sanitation is responsible for that strip of land, and this is a strip of land from 37th Avenue to 34Th Avenue along the West side of the streets along the BQE. So there are two issues. The first issue is just the litter and trash along 69th Street and the other issue is more complicated and that is that the BQE is dividing line between community Board, two and Committee Board, three right and the actual overpass areas. No one picks up the garbage. Many people know that's an area where day laborers congregate, there's some homeless people there, but there are some city- issued trash cans on that area, which we call the plaza. So it's the area right above the BQE and no one collects that trash. So I've had a volunteer for three years now, go almost daily summer winter spring and fall and take those trash bags and bring them in the corner. To have you guys pick them up, but it just seems crazy that there are trash cans there and someone needs to decide where can we board to or end and committee Board three begins and pick up cash there? Okay, I would like to get better eyes on that exactly if we could maybe set up, maybe 10:15 minutes of your time, one day a week or next week, and maybe I could meet you out there, you could show me exactly what you're talking about and I'm sure if it's under our purview, we I'll be more than happy to set something up, not a problem at all happy to do it 10 years in the making seems like a long time, and I if we can devote 15 to 20 minutes to really take a good look at it and I'll have a better idea exactly what you're talking about my contact information? I'm sorry, one more time, can you type your contact information into the chat so that she can con? So if anybody would like to okay, so I will I will do that. I will say I will give you my email and you guys could email me anytime. You want Jovanna can do that as well. That's right! I put that information. I did put that information in the chat, also, okay, so just in closing, I just wanted to give you a heads up that this year's snow removal policy there are no changes. We are going to be just as strong as we were in the past we do about. We do encourage community cleanups. We do do two loan programs. If you guys want to get some residents and concerned citizens together, we do give you the tools and we do dispose of the garbage. We want as much community involvement as possible. All right. Thank you. So much chief, it was, it was a. It was a pleasure meeting everybody! I look forward to working with you guys. I have you know. I have a long history of working in Queens and I I do not anticipate. I do not anticipate there being any issues moving forward and if there are I'm more than happy to address them in a timely fashion, all right very good. Thank you so much good night, all night, Veronica, Sermaniento Veronica, are you here. I saw her yeah and we placed the flyer in our folders in regards to what you'll discuss all right go ahead hi, so tomorrow there will be a flu vaccine clinic. I know it's not as close as we would hope, but they do not need insurance and they work. Immigration status will be counted either. It's a free flu vaccine tomorrow I sent the flyer over with the information. Please take. Please disseminate it to everyone, if possible, because Covid-19 and the flu are kind of going together, we're trying to make people aware of the importance of the flu vaccine and of getting tested. So if you guys need any other information besides that, I always send it over to miss Giovanna. I sent over some flyers last week too. I hope you got them and they were in different languages. They were in about 11 different languages. All right. Thank you! So much all right, Anna, hello, everyone! I was able to get my camera to work so hi everyone. So my name is Anna Schatz, I'm with the Department of Health and Mental hygiene. I normally cover southern Brooklyn and Staten island, but my colleague Chaina was not able to join today, so I'm filling it for him. Hopefully I'll be able to answer your questions, but just to go through some updates. So currently our data is available on our data page. That's on Nyc.Gov word, slash health and all of the latest data is shared there. We have a recess tab that has been added in light of the you know, uptick in cases that we're seeing throughout Brooklyn and Queens- and you know, parts of the city so just as a as a general Queens has had seventy four thousand six hundred and thirty confirmed cases and of those cases, twenty four percent or eighteen thousand and thirty people have been hospitalized in Queens and there have been six hundred thousand and fifty seven confirmed deaths and one thousand two hundred and thirty two probable deaths in Queens. So in terms of the recent update cases, you can go on to the website Nyc.Gov forward, Slash Covid-19 zones, I'll drop, that into the chat box. Later, but that is where you can see the the red and the yellow zone, so there are no more orange stones. They have been absorbed by the yellow zones at this time. So you're able to go on to that map on the website and you're able to put in your address or whatever address that you're interested in and see what zone it could be in and next to it will be explanations as to what the regulations for those zones are right and you're able to see. You know what it is that you need to follow, and you know equivalent 19 continues to spread in New York City with concerning increases in community transmission in these certain neighborhoods and New York City is taking action by implementing restrictions in the zones that are identified by the state right, so these are coming from the state from the governor and we are able to then just take those and transit them into city. I mean on our city, but I just wanted to also remind that these do come from our governor. You know we want to continue doing what we have been doing to make sure that our case numbers go down and that we're able to just do everything we can to get back to normal or the new normal that is going to be by following four cores. So it's social distancing us at least six feet apart from each other wearing a face covering a mask over your mouth and your nose. At the same time, you want to wash your hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer. That's not durable, alcohol-, based hand, sanitizer and also staying home if you're sick. So if you have any symptoms, if you're feeling sick, you want to stay home and make sure that you come outside only for very essential things like going to seek health care or picking up medicine groceries that kind of stuff, unless you're able to get someone to you, know, deliver those for you and then a test to pray team that comes out of health and hospitals. They also have a take care portion of their it's a situation. So anyone that does test positive, they're able to you know help them figure out resources for food and isolation. If that is necessary, get learn more about test and trace at test and Trace.Nyc and in terms of getting tested. We want to make sure people are getting tested so that people are in knowledgeable as to if they might have Covid-19 so that they can get go ahead and make sure to quarantine and isolate and the locations can be found at nyc.gov, slash coded test for free site near you. I also want to do you know a reminder that health and hospital sites in New, York, City and state sites should be free of charge for Kobe test, but some of the private locations do charge so before you go to get your tests, make sure to call, especially if it's a private organization that is giving the test to find out. You know how much that might cost so that you're not stuck with any kind of charges. But if you go to health and hospitals that is free of charge, they won't ask you for immigration status or regardless. If you do or do not have insurance, so we recommend on doing that all new yorkers should get tested regardless of symptoms or increased risk, and it's the best way to help stop the spread and protect our loved ones. Right repeat, testing should be considered if you have symptoms of 19 and the list of symptoms is listed on our website and I you and your provider might be concerned. If you have had possible exposure by have spent time in a large crowd or there has been a breach in your face covering, while you were around other people or you've, been in contact with someone that has tested positive. You know recently within when you were not near each other. You want to get tested also, if you're going to see someone that might be more vulnerable and be at higher risk of getting Covid-19, you might want to make sure that you get tested so that you're keeping that individual safe and as we're talking about testing. I also want to talk about antibody testing. Free antibody testing is currently available on a walking basis at 11, acute care facilities of New, York, City, Health and hospital and they're open to those who have not had copin 19 symptoms or positive kubin19 diagnostic tests within the past two weeks. But we want to be careful about the results that we get, because they can be false, positive results and it's possible that you did not have copin 19 and the antibodies that are detected by the test are from a different Corona virus. So we do not yet know whether someone who has had copin 19 if they can get it again, and this brings up the sorry, the concept of heard immunity that you might have been hearing about as well right. So we do not yet know what percentage of population must have Covid-19 to achieve herd immunity with most infections herd immunity is achieved when 70 to 90 percent of the population is immune to the infection and based on the number of confirmed cases and antibodies surveys and other studies. New York City is nowhere near that threshold, and so, while some communities may have had may have been hit harder by Covid-19 than others, community specific herd immunity is not feasible in New York City, just to the fact that there's so much movement between neighborhoods- and you know, people coming in to the city from outside as well. So, therefore, you know there is emerging evidence of potential for reinfection, and that means that it may be possible for someone to get coped 19 again, and you know for all of those reasons. It is. You know critical to maintain precautions following the core. Four that I mentioned, and you know trying to do. All we can to you know, help stop the spread of cobit 19. right. So, regardless, if you've been sick before or not, you should follow the prevention guidelines and, if you're hearing someone saying I do not need to wear face covering because I've had you know my antibodies has positive. That's not true. Everyone should be doing the just social distancing, face coverings, washing hands, staying home if you're, sick, all right and I'm happy to take any questions you might have and also just want to end with a PSA to get your flu shot. If you have not already you a the season usually starts around this time in the early fall, and we want to prevent you know facing a twin endemic where you have a Kobe, 19 and influenza at the same time, so you know, and as well as making sure that we're not going to overwhelm our health care system, so we want to make you know we do have ways to prevent the flu, so I get your flu shot and on our website we also have a health map where you can find out where you can get a free vaccine and different community based events that are listed on their page as well and I'll try to make sure to drop all of those things into the chat box. Okay, our first question comes from Nula, I believe hi. This is Nula. I had a very specific question and that is that the schools have now sent out an email for high school students, so they must get a meningitis vaccine, and normally the schools have a lot of time to tell you about this, but now they just sent it out. They need it by November. 6. is the city offering that vaccine for free to students renee on this specific question next question kev. The next question, I believe, is Margaret hi hello. I made a complaint about significantly impactful pigeon droppings, the 35Th Avenue and 34Th Avenue, where they pass under the BQE are like coded. When I walk through it's disgusting, I have to roll my pants up. I take my shoes off before I even enter my apartment. When I made the 3- 1- 1 complaint, it went to department of men's health and mental hygiene. So I'm wondering if there's anything you can do to. Please highlight that and get us some cleanup of the thick layer of filth. That's there, okay, Miss English. Would you be able to forward me the 311 complaint, the number, so I can see what the status of it is and if it's indeed with us, no problem? Okay, thank you. Okay and the next question is Megan hi, thanks so much for being with us tonight. My question is it's not clear from the city, websites or other websites? What city testing facilities provide tests for Covid-19 for children under two? There seems to be conflicting information both online and if you actually contact the site, how can we find out where actually offers tests to kids under two and what sort of procedures are in place for those kids, since they can't wear masks, can't necessarily wait lines. Things like that, there's a lot of confusion in the parents with young children community in this regard and we'd love information. So we know how to get our kids tested. Of course, that's a really good question, so Tessa trace would have an answer for that. What you know is in place for it and I'll make sure that someone from test and trace gets into contact with you to let you know about children under two in terms of getting tested where and the whole process of what's in place for them great. Thank you and we have time for a few more questions, so we're going to open it up to lopsong and then Lorinda. So Lobsong you have the floor. Okay, thank you. Thank you. So much like for the Covid-19, you said that's an upstage in coins and some in Brooklyn and what was the indicator or what the reason behind the uptick and what the New York City is doing to control those things. I know there's some news coming out of new Brooklyn about the large gathering, what not, but what other indications as that's pushing the uptick right. So there you know, Kobe 19 is still around right and it's still present and even though we were able to you, know, crush the curve and make sure that we got to the other side of it. Kobe 19 is still present and, as far as we know, all the things that contribute to its spread are still very much active, and that is why we, you know, still have not fully reopened everything and we're still being really cautious and, following you know, cases and natives to make sure that we do not come back to where we were in April and in March in terms of overwhelming our health care system, and you know the amount of deaths that we're helping so that the simple messaging that we've been sharing about or for in terms of the face covering because of the way it's transmitted through droplets in the air. We want to make sure that people are staying apart from each other. You do not gather indoors right. So that's why you know all the indoor gatherings are being pulled apart and and just you know like washing hands and you know staying home if you are symptomatic and if you're sick, but it's as simple as that, you know, and it's the same messaging that we've been sharing from beginning. That's still the most accurate and the strongest messaging that we can give in terms of how we can prevent it, and in light of that as well, I forgot to mention on our website on under the code page there's the flyers and posters section and for any of those flyers and posters that you'd like to share that help message out all of these things. Let me know, and we can mail it directly to your office or whatever business you want, so that you can just you know, share it with local businesses to remind folk to you know where face covering and stay six feet apart, especially for with people that are not part of your household okay, Lorenda hi. Does the Department of Health offer Free pneumonia vaccines to the community, their free influenza vaccines that are being offered and, if you're interested in like hosting one, we can try to see if we can coordinate what the capacity would be for any specific community. If there are not efforts there already, so we can, you know, coordinate with the vaccine task force to see what the capacity is for that, but on the the health map you can see where you can get flu vaccines for free, no, but she's talking about pneumonia yeah. So I do not think they're free pneumonia vaccine specifically, but they are the flu ones. We'll write that down as one of the questions that I'll send over to you is that for you, yep sounds good okay and we'll just do one more question: elba elbandia! Yes, my question is when I went to get my flu shot. The person at the pharmacy told me that they do not have the strong one. I do not even know that there was one for over 65. He said that they out of stock and it's a shortage like citywide. Do you have any idea? When do we get we'll get that one? So there is not a shortage, it's just the you know it's the usual supply that comes in it's just this year. We've been really good with our messaging and folk have been good about getting their flu vaccine. So basically we just need to restock it, but it is correct. There are different types of flu shots for folk that are over 65 and those are that are under, but is this a new one for this year because they cover it or it's being you know all the time, because I never knew I always took the regular one right. So there are, let me see every year there is a new strain that is are happening. So that's why the messaging is, you know every year you want to make sure that you get your flu shot. So if you got last year it does not it's not active for this year and this year the flu vaccine contains three new virus strains. Okay, thank you right. Thank you so much and tell tell your partner the Queens and all these all over Queens that you did a wonderful job perfect. Thank you! So much guys and see you guys, because Anna covers Staten, Island and shade was very busy right now. All right. Thank you. So I'd like to all call up the we're now we're going to open up the session for our FY 2022 capital and expense budget and I'll just show on the screen. What's in our folders and I'll call up our two chairs alba buendia and Reverend Herron and her and Reverend Haran is going to the Capitol and Elba is going to do the expense, so I'm going to put it on the screen: okay, Reverend, Haron and elba. Okay, now you can go ahead. Reverend Iran, as some of you, the board members, have the except the capital expense budget in their in their hands and but for all of the visit, the guests from the community. These are the expense budgets that we, the expense budget, that we see that we have for this year. We we have some things that we are introducing to the budget that are new if you can just as they're being scroll down. These are these three items are something new that will be introduced to the budget, to upgrade the 90 street playground repair and replace the decorative pavement at Flushing Bay promenade. It's a trip hazard and also to reinstate bathrooms located at the Flushing bay promenade. Those are three items that, as we met in committee, we decided that these three things needed to be added. The one thing that we would like we're going to remove, that's being removed is number 15 in that it was formerly 15.. It was to provide funding for bus pads. The MTA informed us that was that was something that was not needed. Therefore, it was removed from the capital budget. It was the D.O.T that they said it was a low priority. Oh, it was D.O.T, okay, all right so yeah and I think we're going to go into more discussion about this within executive session. So I do not know if you want to ask the community if they'd like to add any other items. Yes, if the community would like to yes but board members, please save your questions or suggestions for when we go into executive session. Would anyone like to from the community? Would they like to share? Well, if not I'll, ask Elba to continue into sharing the expense budget I apologize. I was trying to type. I do have a question about the library I saw there to. I think, that's a great idea to expand our libraries, but I could not see it was fund, a new library where what item is that reverend's number to fund the library? Can you tell me what can you tell me what's number one? I think it looks like seven now that you stopped northwest yes, northwest northwestern sector, I would add, for future reference also to the South West sector, as you've heard. I live in that corridor along the BQE and it's a long walk to the library right. Well, what was considered is that they would use the Lexington school for the deaf to be considered as a possible site for constructing a library on that in that northwestern sector northwest sector. And can you just type your comments in the in the chat and the and the chairs will take that information? Okay, all righty elba! Thank you. Next, there's! No other okay! Good evening. Everybody all of the special body priorities are basically the same with a few reception which are one it's a new one is an increased funding for illegal posting personnel and we also remove one former item number 20, which was retrofit apartments for senior incentive task abatement for owners. This was due that it does not concern the city but the estate. Also, we made some changes. We move up priorities on items former 22 to 5, former 23 to 6 and former 28 to 7. the reason because they were all related and also very important, do the pandemic and the sanitation and the cleaning is very important. Any questions any suggestion. Thank you all right. So there's no see, there's no questions for Elba and reverend Haron we'll take that up in executive session, all right, I'd like to call up our next chairs, Hamlet and Marta Hamlet. Okay. Tonight we have a tonight. We have a joint public hearing with land use, it's BSA calendar number, 2019-, 18a1, Marina road, we're going to have the parks department, give their presentation and then, after they give their presentation we'll take the questions. Okay, I also like to add the description of this project. It's this application is being submitted to quest variants for the following building code regulations, one Appendix, G, section, G, 304.2 item six, which refers to no development or new construction of the V zone and Num2 and Appendix G Section G304 point to item to new construction in the V zone to be constructed above design. Flood elevation, slash, base, ele base flood elevation, so those are the main items of contention for the the work that Parks is interested in getting a variance. Thus far, all right, your speaker is on Eric you're, open, you're, Mike yep. How are you doing everybody good evening? Everybody? My name is Aaron akbork from New York, City, Parks Department. I work in the engineering department and I'm the project manager for the reconstruction of the world's fair marina. We also have this is a consultant design job by Mclaren Engineering. Who is our lead engineer and designer the overall goals of the project are to reconstruct the peers and floating docks at the Wells Fair Marina. We want to create a peer for public access with concessions, site, furnishings, restrooms, Kayak, rentals and boat refueling. We want to provide a secure, pier in Marina and dock areas, with amenities for fishing event, charter boats and permittee boaters. The total budget is 44.2 million dollars and that's a combination of FEMA federal money and city mayoral money. As I have mentioned, we we're back here at community board due to our BSA variants application. We have. We requested a variance from certain requirements of Appendix G of New York City Building code, which is for flood resistant construction. Specifically, they are from section three 304.2 item six, which is no new construction is to be located, seaward of the reach of mean in high water and the V zone and item two, the lowest portion of the horizontal lowest portion of the lowest horizontal structural member of the of the low sorry of the lowest member shall be above the design flood elevation, the in order to comply with the determinations made by the New York City Department of small business services, the SBS, which has jurisdiction overall waterfront and maritime construction, city- owned properties. We we will. This is why we pursued the BSA variants and this variance is necessary for the proposed reconstruction of an existing concession structure that was located on pier 1, and we want to relocate that on the onto the new pier one, just a couple of slides here on Norville Project, here's a aerial view of the site, pier 1 and P3, are located in Flushing bay. Pier 1 here is to the east and Pier 3 to the west and here's Citi field as a reference of the site. Here's a little before and after of the site left it. The left image is from 1966, and here more currently on the right is 2017.. In this 1996 area. You can see that you can clearly see the jetty and, and one of the reasons we are relocating our p1, a little closer to the west, is to take advantage of the protections Jetty provides. This is the FEMA flood map. As you can see, our construction and design is in within the V zone, so this does come with more stringent regulations. This here is just the overall project scope. The overall scope of the project is to for p1 is to reconstruct and re- reconstruct the pier the floating docks up, rehab the start, retaining wall and bulkhead here in front of the existing pier one and for p3. It is also to reconstruct the fixed portion of pier 3 and repair and replace the floating dots at pier 3 as well, and overall we are going to upgrade the site utilities at this facility. This next ariel is a zoomed in here of Pier 3., I'm sure, most of you aware of this site. It's this pedestrian bridge over the over the grand central Parkway is the is a bridge, that's adjacent to Denmark Boulevard in 31st drive. The parking lot here in front of pier 3 is actually the boat yard at worlds. Ameriworld's, fair, marina. This building here is the welfare, restaurant and current marina offices. This here is our pier 3 design. This blue shaded area is the is the fixed pier that we are going to reconstruct, which includes a new ADA compliant aluminum gangway. We are going to relocate the existing electrical service equipment. That's on the pier, currently upland and elevated, as per as per Appendix G Code, and we are going to repair and reconstruct a number of floating docks, including new guide. Piles, still got piles here on that in the floating dock section, the floating wave tenures will remain on the job where we won't be touching them. This here is the there's two pictures here. Above of the current condition of existing pier three existing, the fixed, pier three will be demolished, and since the pier is in bad shape and it has been repaired in the past a few times, the existing timber piles will be will be replaced with new, more resilient steel pipe piles. The the pier itself will be will entail new new elements such as the new Park, New, Pile, Concrete, Pile, caps, new piled, concrete deck and above the concrete deck will be new timbered deck decking new guardrail will be will be installed as well. We will be removing this, this electrical service equipment and then moving it up land, as I stated before, and it will include a new longer ADA compliant gangway. Here is the existing aerial of pier 1.. Currently peer one is closed off to the public. The fixed pure portion of pure one is close to the public, including the amenities of the concession structure, existing construction structure and fuel. The current boaters are do have access currently, just as they step right inside the pier they go down a gangway and do have access to their boats. Currently on the floating docks, the and, as you can see here, the the commercial boaters have constructed a temporary access to to their commercial vessels. Here since the since the pier itself has been closed for a couple years now, the new design will actually be be moved about a thousand feet over to the west. It's a more modest and value engineered design. Like I said it, we moved it to the west because it's a protected area, a more protected area of the bay. In addition, it takes less fixed, pier to get out to deeper water, and if you see here, we have some dotted black lines and you know: we've we thought of future expansion as finally becomes available, so design is of the floating docks are modular and we will be able to extend it with future funding available. As I stated, it takes less fixed period to get to to deeper water. As you can see here, the purple shade is the deepest and the yellow is the shallowest, so the and at its existing location, all the floating docks would have been in the green and yellow shaded areas, and now, with a with a shorter, more modest, fixed, pier, we are able to get the first row of floating docks into deeper water as well as future expansion will all will achieve deeper water without without any weight for water depths. This is a flow diagram. The Orange line here is for border circulation, the the permitted boaters who have boats and on the floating docks as well as any human- powered boaters such as dragon, boaters and kayakers, we'll be going up. The the main part of the fixed, pier and will have access to a security gate to the to the floating docks. The rest of the circulation will be for commercial and charter slips, as well as concession users and fuel dock users that will that will circulate up the main, the main, fixed, pier and up towards the concession structure. This here is the required site utilities, the currently the site we appear one and we currently our sanitation, is pumped to holding tanks or is pumped to holding tanks, and we have to clean out the holy text regularly. Our new design we were, we are going to hook up to sanitary Lines city lines which, which is a big upgrade, as well as electric electrical services, will be upgraded and modernized to meet the 21st century. Demands of of the Marina Water Service water service does exist at the site. However, some lines will have to be replaced as they are original lines from back in the world's fair era, and the fuel lines will have to be ran from where they are currently to the new pier here's, a just a proposed utility plan. As you can see, the floating docks, the boaters will have water and electrical services available at their at their adjacent slips. The also all the utilities will be running up the slip towards the commercial slips and fuel will be running towards the fuel dock, which is up by the concession structure. This here highlights the concession structure: it's this blue shaded structure here and zoomed in a little bit here on the right. It is at the end of the fixed pier- and this is the structure which we are going for, the BSA variants to be able to build it at deck level. Here's a little elevation view of the of the structure of the concession structure you can see here. There is a little second floor screening area. This is where the utilities for the concession and bathrooms will be housed. This will be elevated due to the flood design restrictions. The building is, is going to be built to withstand future storm events, and it will be flood proofed, the structure itself, the structural walls, all 12-inch, reinforced concrete, and then you know, as is designed to prevent any floatation or collapse or lateral movement from wind and flood loads utilities that run to this structure and along the pier itself will all be will all be encased within the concrete within the par pure deck again, which will make it a more resilient structure regarding future storms. The here is the floor plan here to the left here is the public bathrooms to the center? Is the utility room and to the right? Is the concession area and fuel attendant area to the right of that is a shade structure outside state structure, it's a pergola type structure and you can see the awning that runs in front of the the bathroom doors and the concession door. We did. We did go through preliminary design approvals through pdc who's, seen the seen the architecture here at the architecture of the building itself. This here is a rendering I'm looking down the fixed pier at pier one and towards the concession building next sign here, zoomed in a little bit a close- up of the concession. You know we picture having removable tables and chairs under the shade structure here, as when the concessionaire is open for selling their food and drinks. Here's just the material palette of the concession structure will be all aluminum siding and, like I said, all the all the materials and methods of this of the structure itself is this designed to withstand future storms and meets all Appendix requirements. The only requirement we're trying to to get a variance from through BSA is being able to construct the low structural member at pure deck elevation. So thank you for your time and any questions. Yes, there were a few questions, I'm going to throw it to pat beckles good evening. Everyone, the port authority, has stated if the air train happens, that an upgrade of the Marina is promised. Is this in any way contingent on that, or is this a separate project that's going to go regardless yeah? This project is going regardless of the air train, so we are. Our funding is all city funding. Port authority is not helping us out with anything. We are aware of a report theory project and we are coordinating with port authority to make sure that you know our jobs are integrated as best as possible and then there's no conflicts, but if they're designs right, this is still going to happen. Yes, if airtrain is not happening in the future, this project is still going forward. Okay, great awesome, thank you, so much yep all right, Margaret flanagan. Thank you. I encourage our community board to support whatever is needed for the Parks Department and the marina to move forward. I think it's a great resource for our community and thanks to everything that the Parks Department does to enhance our life here in our community, and then I just wanted to add that it seems that perhaps the area for canoes is smaller than the existing area. So please consider expanding that or consider how will so many canoes be able to use the site. Thank you, yep. Thank you, I'm! I do not have those I'm sharing my screen now, but yeah. We definitely I've heard from the from our community meetings and public school meetings about the need for more amenities for both from human- powered boaters. So our current design is a little bit. We do widen out what is existing at pier one now from for the boaters, and there is, there is area for expansion as well in the future, as funding comes in all right. The next question is Arthur Tyler the floor is yours: yeah, the the rendering looks like the restrooms and concessions are all on the piers. Will non- boat, odors and pedestrians have access to those facilities. Yes, those are all public facilities. Only restricted access to the public will be down to the floating docks all right. Good. Thank you. Yep Mark Burmester. The floor is yours. Hi there I was wondering what the capacity of the current marina is, especially when compared to this new design, and if the you know, if it's, if it's being fully used, if it's at capacity now pier one in terms of like the number of books that are able to use the appear in the dock, pier one the new design is, is reducing the capacity a little bit. However, we you know, we are designing with future expansion in mind. I do not believe pier one currently is at full capacity, but you know during the reconstruction we will and the Parks Marina Team will will you know, work with existing boaters at pier one to move them over to pure from the old here one to the new, pure one in terms of numbers for capacity. I do not have those off the top of my head in quantity, so I believe yeah leave Nate's on the line as well from parks and arenas. Yeah hi, everyone good to see you all again. We keep meeting that's good thing. I guess yeah the current Marina. I think we're last count just under 300 slips among the two peers, we're not at capacity we were able to add about 40 births over a decade ago. We dedicate that to just transient dockage people may be coming into the mets game, but even with that, even when it's a subway series, we still have capacity there. So we do not see. We do not see a negative impact in the immediate term with this reconstruction in terms of being able to accommodate everybody who wants to come in but as Eric said, the the big goal here is to is to is to for future expansion as well to set us ourselves up for that as we get more demands so we'll be prepared for that. Are you hoping that more people will use it when it's upgraded? Is that the idea? I imagine they will? I imagine they? Will I I'll be honest. You know, as New York emerges from the current climate, I do not think a lot of people are buying boats. You know the boats tend to be the last thing. People get in good times and the first thing they get rid of in bad times we're starting to see a lot more use during what everyone's been through this past summer, because it's kind of a socially distance people can get out, but I have not seen a lot of new acquisitions, so you know we'll be ready for you know the future, but at this point I think the plan that we have really accommodates what we have now with a little room for growth and then yeah as we upgrade. I would hope that we would be able to grow the model in the future. All right, Andrew, Sokoloff, Diaz Andrew the floor is yours. Hi. Thank you yeah. My question is how this project will be impacted by the proposed airtrain. I do not know if that was specifically discussed, how it would affect the timeline. Sorry just give me a second: I did it Kevin. Okay, all right! You got to it faster than me so, like I said, we've been trying to coordinate with port authority as much as we can regarding the air train project. The funding is separate. Port authority is not. This project was conceived before the air train was, was you know, public and the the peers for the air train or the or support structures for the air train will not be in the vicinity of of pier one. So pure one really won't be affected. Pier three, the pier itself won't be affected, however, the boat, Yard and Marina Office will be relocated closer to where p1 is being proposed. So we have been working with port authority and trying to share drawings to make sure that we, you know, we minimize any conflicts. Okay, heiko cornelius and the floor is yours, hi, Community, Board, three member. Thank you. First of all for the presentation, two questions, one, the variance does it cover only the infrastructure portion and or the concession stand and second question is the product is located. As you noted in the V zone, which means there is a one percent plus chance that the project is being flooded and any damages caused by any such flooding. How would that be? How would any such damage be covered, or how would is there any plan if that occurs, that it would be repaired or fixed in the future? Yeah? I mentioned one of the beginning, slides that we have a combination of female federal money and and mayoral money. The FEMA money is because of hurricane Sandy, so FEMA is funding. Some upgrades at the site and we are trying to you, know mitigate any any. We obviously experience hurricane Sandy so we're trying to mitigate any damages that we experienced during Sandy, which includes stronger, floating docks, higher guide, piles in case flood levels increase. As I mentioned, the concession structure and piers are and peer structures are going to be resiliently built, for example, the concession structure is going to be anchored into the into the new pier, so it yeah, so it won't float away during the a wind or flood load event won't collapse or there won't be any lateral movement, and- and, as I mentioned, the floating docks will be more resilient and and the guide piles for those flowing, docks will be taller than Fp1 will be taller, and some of them at p3 will also be taller at to make sure that the appears do not over top during a a really high tide, a really high storm event, all right and go ahead and start coming. No, I'm not finished I'm talking about, I guess who's responsible for damage. You know that you would have to obviously determine the severity of the damage of any future storm or event and and yeah, for example, Hurricane, Sandy or FEMA did come in and and provide some money to repair what was what was damaged as well as upgrade, which we are utilizing in this design, and how long did that take for damage in other parts of the city in regards to peers did not that take a long time to get the funding. It does take a little bit of time yup and we have to there's a little back and forth in negotiation with FEMA, and obviously we try to to optimize that and try to get as much as we can through FEMA, so that it is a it is a lengthy process and regarding other peers in the city you know this is this: is a for parks Department. This is one of the bigger peers that we have and it's a big reconstruction job, a lot of the peers that we've done have been kind of been rehabbed in place or repaired in place, and we were able to use female money for that. As well, and so the money is only or the variance is only covering the session stand or the infrastructure also requires the infrastructure is we do not? We do not need a variance for the for the peers and the floating docks itself. It's just for the concession structure it's taken from the building code, so it it's not really catered for. Building on a pier, but SBS has the jurisdiction or access deal as the building department on the on the waterfront, and we are, you know, we're trying to to get this variant so that we can build that concession structure on pier one. Thank you, okay, and I think the last question in the chat is frank. So if you, if anyone else, has any questions, please register your question in the chat because we will be closing Q&A if there are no other questions after Frank go ahead. Frank Taylor the floor is yours. I guess he's not there. Well, his question is: what is being done at pier three? Was that already covered? I feel like I heard that yep Pier 3 is not a public peer. We are reconstructing the fixed portion of it, which is the section. That's as you could come off the promenade. We are building a an upgraded pier there as well. You know it was all timber structure, it was repaired in the past, the timber piles are deteriorated and they need to be repaired. We're going to knock that all down and put a new structure. Steel piles, reinforced, concrete pile caps and pile decking new timber decking above the concrete decking new serial making ADA compliant with a new, gangway and and upgrading the electrical service there as well, and the the flooring docks itself will also be repaired and guidepiles will be replaced and brought up to brought up to code per FEMA requirements. Okay. Well, there are no more questions in the chat, so I throw it back to the chairs frank. You have a background noise. So yes yeah, we can hear you now Frank. There was a lot of background noise. We just addressed your question. Did you hear it frank? I guess he's driving all right. Okay, all right go ahead, Martha and Hamlet. Okay, we will. We will take up this issue in executive session and any board members who have additional questions. We'll have a discussion at that time. Thank you, edmund Rosenbaum Business echo, okay. Good evening. We have four applicants today. First one I keep bringing up the report on my phone. The first one is Cafe Algo Emas, who are who's. The folks that we have to unmute merrick is the representative he's here. He just needs to unmute himself and Carlos and Carlos. Can we unmute them or they've, muted themselves, they've, muted, themselves, Carlos and Merrick? Can you please unmute yourself? Thank you. Go ahead! Go ahead! Admin, okay, I'm just trying to bring up my report. Okay, can you just give a brief introduction either one of you, the owner of the representative, your choice? Yes, hi Scaffold has been there, for I mean I believe Carlos is present on the phone Carlos Orozco has been imprisoned in present vacation, for I believe, 16 years now, it's been very well received. It's just that they've been operating on food only for the past since the beginning and right now it just decided to basically take this chance and augment his his revenue by adding beer and wine only because it's just stuff that's very difficult to make to make the revenue to stay in business right, and this is an application for wine and beer license. Yes, just thought why Name beer Correct anyone have any questions type it in the chat. Give you a minute or two. There are no questions at this moment this moment. So could you just go over the hours of operation they open early in the morning at six o'clock and right now, currently, the close, also on the nine or ten, but the alcohol service will be 11 in the morning and then until midnight or once the license is granted. So it seems we have no questions, so we will take up the issue in executive session. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Commute yourselves move on to the next one. Next applicant is bar Corp doing business as Mexican restaurant Bar, 8311 Northern Boulevard in Jackson Heights. It's a corporate change of a full liquor license. The proposed owner is Haiti. I saw her here before Katie Cruz.

Trying to you know, survive with all this situation. We are looking forward every day to figure it out. What will be the best choice to keep pushing the you know the business, because these days is too hard 25 of the people inside the call is coming and most of the restaurant that I know they are surviving because they could offer you know wine mirror. Oh, you know Margaritas or something like that, I'm leaving just because I offer just food- and you know that's not good enough most of the people that come here and they say. Oh, but you provide black say we do not provide alcohol, oh I'm sorry and they leave to the next restaurant. They do, and you know, that's a loss that I have to consider and that's the reason why and apply. Okay, so just go over the hours of operation quickly, yeah. Yes, we open at 9:00 A.M. We used to be 9 A.M to 9:00 p.m. If, through all the time through you know all the businesses, we was managing right here, Monday to Friday nine, to nine Thursday, to Sunday nine to 10 p.m. Okay, are there any questions?

So much for the opportunity have a blessed night, bye-, bye and Erica. If you email the community board, if it's a specific location with that information, that would be appreciated. I'll I'll give you the email address right now: okay, in the chat all right, so you're completed correct, edmund all right, so everyone we're going to go into executive session. As you know, we open the executive session with the pledge of allegiance all right Kevin. Oh this, I'm up, I got ta make it happen all right. Let's share the screen here, all right: everyone I pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic, which is all right. Thank you, Kevin and thank you all. I call for a motion to adopt our agenda, all in favor aye, all right motions by I'd like capital and expense chairs to come on, and I'm going to show my screen and you will be focusing on this area right here already reverend Iran. Thank you. So therefore we're looking at the changes, the new, the new things that we'd like to add, which is the upgrade to 90 street playground, the repairing on replacement and to replace the decorative pavement at the Flushing bay promenade. It is a trip hazard right now. It's and it's in need of repair, also to reinstate bathrooms located at the Flushing bay promenade, also to remove the what was formerly number 15, which was providing funds for the bus pad which, as vanetta stated, the D.O.T told us we, it was not high priority and we did not need it. Does any members of the board have any suggestions or would like to discuss anything? Ed Wesley has a question. He posted it on privately to me so Ed. Can you ask? Can you mute him, please Kevin, so he can ask his question. He can not mute himself, but yeah. Give me a second he's, unmuted already all right. So if you can go add your question sure my question is is on the capital budget. I do not know what the number is, but it's pretty far down in the list on the creation of a community art center in Jackson Heights. That was the high expense budget, only capital that was the one related to the post office. You remember is that the one you remember that one reverend Iran we had discussed that one that we wanted clarification on. What number was that one that was number two? Let me see where it is. I got it. No, I do not see it here. Let me just search for it. It was called and okay, it's on the all right. I got it right here, so here it goes here. It goes. This is what you're talking about ed number 24., that's it yeah! Okay. I would like to add to that or any space that becomes available in Jackson Heights. Oh, so what to the 24? You want to add to add to that any space that becomes available so not just the poster in Jackson Heights, if the, if it's not the post office somewhere else, then that's correct. Okay, thank you. Yeah there's another question from Arthur Tyler: can you unmute him please Arthur and ask your question sure it seems to me that the 90th street playground was quite recently upgraded. What else do you want on the upgrade for the 90th street playground? Well, this came from a member of the public that joined the call right and they did not necessarily go into specifics. Is that correct? I'm sorry they cheers said they just asked for to upgrade the knight streets playground all right. It was just done so so maybe it's already taken care of. They did not specify what they wanted. Anyone else! No, that that's it Arthur was the last one David, it's pastor, Peter Herron or it's David, Herrera Sorry David Rizzero. What is your question? Well, I just happened to live by the 86Th Street park. I can't hear you can't hear me all right, hello, yeah see, go ahead, you hear me well, yes, I can hear you now I'm talking about the Goldman's park the Goldman's park. They never do any maintenance. They have several a lot of time, a lot of things to be repair the floor. It's got a crack on the on the on there. On the pave, it's got a problem with some trees. We need some doors and the handball courts. We have a lot of issues I have requested many times. I do not know if that park is to consider the maintenance on that park. Okay, you wanted to consider the maintenance on that park on 88Th street. Well, the thing that I request constantine is, he is pretty good and the board one in Astoria. It's look David on number 25, which one did you say it was. Let's see which item did you say is that on the expense that you mentioned, I do not think he said it was on the. I do not think he mentioned it here. It goes David. Can you read number 25? Yes, number 25 upgrade gorman's playground, phase, 2, multiple purpose area, also the basketball courts. So it's in the budget and if it's something related to cleanliness or whatever other items, that's something that that's a that's a service level issue that should be submitted to the board. If I can also just add one other thing to say that phase one is going, is I'm sorry phase two is going to be done before phase one the children's playground is going to be put on hold, while the multi- purpose area is going to be taken care of first okay, but I need another. This is like the floors crack the all- purpose and the basketball courts are cracked. I got deep in on the on the floor and I need the four doors for the handball court, because the ball goes out and I see the children running underneath the cars that pass by 80, 85 and 84th street. You have to put the gate doors to prevent the balls go out. They're running after the current underneath the cars accident can happens, the ball is very little. It runs underneath the cars- and you know you have to put- is very important. I've been playing all this summer and I know how bad it is to be running after a little ball when it gets out of the court. Can you plea? Can you please put those specifics into the chat on me? Can you please put them into the chat, those specific those specific things that you're talking about? Can you put them in the chat? Therefore it could be a part of that construction item. Do you mean right now? Yes, if you can no, I do not think okay all right, so we have it recorded. So we'll have it right. If there's nothing else, you need to quote when it's when everyone has submitted their comments, you have to call for a motion for the capital. Yeah Megan Rockwell had a comment. Okay go ahead, can you read it? Can you say what it is megan, please? Oh, I was going to provide some additional color on the last ones of the 90th street playground. It does look older than travers. So just a note, so it does need some repairs. Okay, if everyone has, I have shared what they with desire to see the changes. I want to call to motion to call a motion on the capital budget. Can someone please make a motion? Is it a motion with any additions with the new additions? Oh, can I do that rin renee go ahead. I call motion to us to make a motion on this capital expense with the new editions anyone's just come back a second yeah and all in favor we have to do. We have to do a roll call for that.

I like to all call up now: the land Use, Committee and Park. Okay, then you some parks, okay, good evening, everybody! Yes good evening, everybody! Let me first preface before Hamlet reads the recommendation, and then we open it for discussion. After the October 13th joint committee of land use and parks, additional information was acquired from the Parks Department and the Joint committee of land use and parks reconvened to review the new information on October 21st. After the review, the joint committee unanimously concurred to submit the following recommendation and Hamlet will read that. Thank you. Okay, as of October 21st 2020, Committee, Board, 3, land use and parks, committees, BSA calendar number, 2019- 182, a one Marina Road Corona New York one. Thirteen sixty eight block one, seventeen, eighty nine lot 65 so in district park. This pier 1 Dhoni Disregard 3- 2, is pier 3. in a matter of application regarding world's fair marine reconstruction, one Marina Road Corona New York Mclaren Engineering group on behalf of New York City Department of Parks and recreation owner, are seeking to a variance from certain requirements of dependence, g flood resistant construction for the 2- 4 2014 New York City Building Code, to comply with the termination made by the New York City Department of small business services regarding the proposed reconstruction. These are notices of objection. Letters issued by the small business services from which the Parks Department and Mclaren Engineering group are requesting variances. The proposed waterfront construction can not meet the requirements of objections, one for applications, number 2019, an objection, one for application, 2019 3733 and therefore variance is required from the following sections of the building code: Appendix G, Section, G, 304.2 item six Asce 24, section 4.3 and 44 cfe, section 60.3. No new construction is to be located. Seaward of the reach of the Mean high tide in the V zone. Next Appendix G, Section, G304.2, item 2 and Asce 1.5.2, the lowest portion of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor shall be at or above the design. Fluid elevation specified in Asce 24 table 4- 1 resolution, the land use and Parks Committee after review of this matter recommends the application for variances be disapproved. The provisos listed below benefit the community in our submitted, as they are all reasonable requests for upkeep and maintenance parks. Department did not confirm that the providers listed would be accommodated, advisors, new accessible toilet rooms for men and women to be located along promenade, to provide provisions for parks and attendees and closures for maintenance and security. Three make repairs required to fence foot, to fence fencing and damaged pavers along route of Promenade. Four enhance pier 3 in entrance area. Landscaping and structural system has areas of floating docks and piers similar to pier one scope of work. Five provides concessions, facilities at ps3 for Con convenience of boaters, six, provide additional clarifications and coordinations regarding construction activities between New York City, Parks, Department and Port Authority addressing Laguardia Air train Development, seven replace the travel lift for ps3, eight delivering nation of black lanes and pedestrian lanes are required at promenade. Nine plans are required to prevent control flooding. Responsibility for flood damages, 10 parking permits required at a certain area to existing parking areas along promenade 11 peer entrance shall require locking devices to encourage security and safety in Favor 15 total 15.. Thank you. I second, the motion Hamlet. If there's anybody that would like to discuss any questions, Mark Burmester has a question. Thank you. So my understanding is that we're that the recommendation is to not approve the variance because of we did not get assurances that they would be doing. Work unrelated to the peer like adjacent to the peer, but not on the peer itself, is that right, we're trying to use it as leverage or can you discuss more of the reason why that recommendation was made well, I said you want to address that sure I'll address it. The thing is that all the items that we asked for are things that could be accommodated and they were not willing to accommodate the community, and this is something where, if we disapprove this letting them know that these items are what is important to us. They may come back and look at it again, but we felt the committee. The two committees felt that this would be the best way to approach this. I do not know if you want to add something hamlet to this. No that covers it. Well, thank you. Any other questions, that's it that was it. Okay, pull the question questions! Okay! This is a land use motion, BSA calendar number, 2019-, 18 or one Marina, Road, 182a, 1828, sorry, 182, a 182 hey.

It seems like a lifetime ago, but in October 2019 queen's Community board number three was preparing to walk in the annual Halloween parade, attend the annual diwali celebration sponsored by the Jackson Heights Merchants Association, and plan planning strategies to get out the 2020 count with the Queensborough President's office. Who would have ever imagined that in October 2020 we would be impacted by Covid-19 pandemic, our residents would be experienced food and financial insecurities our businesses would be struggling to keep their doors open and we would face the real risks of being under counted in this 2020 census. As you know, our community is resilient and we are all doing our best to live in the new normal. I encourage you all to continue, participating or sorry practicing social, distancing and wearing your mass Covid-19 is real and the investig infection rates, as we heard earlier from the Department of Health, are rising again. We must protect ourselves and our families from this devastating virus. I'm happy to report, despite the administration's decision to end the census on October 15, our enumeration percentages in East, almost Jackson Heights in north Corona, are over 96 percent community board. Three is a special board with members who want the very best for East Elmhurst, Jackson, Heights and North Corona, despite the fact that we're meeting virtually, I still encourage you all to please attend your various board committees. So what have we done since the last meeting? And I know that I sent everyone out an email from the last borough board, which is a couple of days ago talking about voting. I thought that was very interesting. Hopefully you had the opportunity to look at it. The borough president's office she's collecting new coats from October 12th through November 13th. So please, if you have new, quotes, drop them off at Borough, Hall and she's. Also, collecting toys up to October 30th for, and it's been collected from a young man, that's a cancer survivor and those toys will be given to young people that are currently cancer victims. You have the opportunity to participate in the or submit comments for the Laguardia Eis. Hopefully you did submit comments. Remember voting early voting starts on October 24th through November 1st and those that have received an absentee ballot, but you're deciding to go and vote at your poll site. You're. Welcome to do that and you could find all that information on the video from the borough president's office that I emailed to you. The information that I have here in regards to Covid-19 testing and, as our presenter mentioned, the different color zones. There has changed since the last two weeks, but you can go to the DOH website and it's listed there on page number, three, which shows you the recent percentages, the Covid-19 rate, and then you also can visit the New York State website, so focused on Covid-19, which will show you the various zones, the Red, Orange and yellow zones. I like to recognize this month is breast cancer. Awareness Month National American Indian Heritage month, Columbus day indigenous people's day young for court, kapoor, Happy Halloween, please be careful out there, those that are taking your young people out. Happy international girls Day hispanic heritage month, October 10th was the mental health day and October 5th was world teachers day and we received the invitation and I have it out there for you to share please on tomorrow, October 23rd from 12 to 2 P.M, the Jackson Heights Merchant Association. They will be giving out over 500 bags of food at diversity Plaza. So please encourage those with food and securities to go to diversity, Plaza October, 23rd from 12 P.M to 2 P.M. Any questions. If you have any questions and concerns, remember you can always email me and I will respond. Read your next district manager's report. Yes, good evening, everyone! My report is going to be very short. I'm sure that many of us would like to see the remaining debate. So I will just make a couple of announcements, one to advise that the Community board has been working very hard during this period of convening with the various agencies to help to develop a budget that will take us through next year. I'm, as I'm sure you have imagined, there are serious budget cuts and you will be seeing seeing that if you have not or already seen it a reduction in some service areas as, for example, sanitation, collections and so forth. The board's response to those budget cuts was to prioritize our issues by moving the sanitation items in our capital expense budget up. They were at a lower priority, so we are trying to do our part by keeping the service agencies funded so that they can do their job and, at the same time, keep our community board clean, safe and healthy, like to also announce that the NCOS are having a meeting on 10:25 at 79Th, Street and 34Th. Avenue all are encouraged to to participate and miss English. We met reported that the Merchants Association is having a food distribution tomorrow. I encourage everyone to attend, and with that I thank you. Have a great evening, I call for a motion for the adoption of our 17 September 17:20 minutes and it any corrections, committees by reports, Health and Social services vivian good evening. Everyone, the health and Social Services Committee met October 7th 2020 by teleconference representatives from the department of Homeless Shelters, Amanda, Nazner and director of the Ibis hotel, shelter, we're invited to give committee updates on head count. It's 172 male clients, rooms, 86 security guards, three shifts 22 per shift on each floor and programming. There was discussion on complaints to community Board 3 concerning homeless individuals, congregating in front of businesses in 82nd street bid and area parks. Community Board 3 will be making recommendations for Ibis Hotel Shelter Advisory Board for poorest membership, 10 to consist of community residents and community Board Members Ibis Hotel shelter is located at 100- 33 bit Mars Boulevard, East Elmhurst, it's submitted by chair of the health and Social Committee Vivian Doc. Thank you all right. Thank you. Vivian Pop, Song love, song and box bomb. Are you here? Immigration Committee medisla? I see Lobsong is muted out, so if he does not respond in a minute or so his report is in the packet, so you can read that on your own if he does not come on in a minute or so all right. So we'll move on committee referrals, Borough, President's report, Lisa, are you there good evening? Everyone? I'm sorry! I have a little feedback. I hope you can hear me well. Thank you so much renee for the complete report that was going to be mine, but it's wonderful that our community came together and really got out. The vote got out the census. I'm anticipating everyone is going to go out and get out the vote, but the census response was amazing. Our numbers were the ones that were coming in behind, but community board three, our Jackson Heights Corona, East, Dumbhurst area came in and everyone we were out there at the bus stops and folks really understood and responded, which was amazing, because that was not our initial and I'm so happy that we were able to work together and work with the Census Bureau and really get our numbers triple from most areas in the borough. Actually. So with that, I thank you all, and it goes to show that we can do anything. We try real hard. As Chair English said. The borough president is very passionate about its toy drive that we're having the king we're calling it. The king Toy drive for for children who are cancer patients, a young man who is recovering and excuse me currently in remission, and he is about nine or 10 years old, and he is really a powerful young man who back to make sure that he gave toys to the children in the hospital. So we're going to give him a hand. And if anyone has toys they'd like to donate, please there's a box in the lobby at Borough, Hall and just drop them in, and we and we're going to make sure that they get to this young man and they're going to distribute them at the hospital for children. We're also having a coat drive and the coat drive will be. We started taking them last week. There was a press release that went out and you should have all received one again. Those locations are at borough hall for the acceptance. Now I'm going to move on to early voting, we have gotten lots and lots of phone calls. Many people are very concerned and confused about the start of early voting, which is this Saturday and for our area. Our immediate area. First baptist church is the polling site, and that also includes the dropbox. So if you're not going in to vote, if you are- or you have an absentee ballot, you can bring your absentee ballot to the site to the dropbox and there was no need for involving the postal service because there's a little concern of insecurity in that way. So it goes right into the hands of the board of elections and gets counted. So with that, my neighbors, I look forward to seeing you or maybe not seeing you at the polls, but I'm sure we'll all get there and you know we're all in this together. So thank you all save Halloween and get out the vote. All right look forward to seeing you all soon. Thank you, lisa Jacqueline, good evening, everyone from council member drums office. I just want to repeat what Lisa said about early voting and remind everyone to you know, get out the vote as well as remind everyone to get your flu shot. Our office is still not open for in person, but we do. We are returning calls and if you we do online as well, we have a zoom account if you prefer that so get that word out. And lastly, you know council, member drum senses regards to everyone and remind everyone to social distance and wear your face mask. Thank you all right. Thank you. James yeah hi, everyone hi, it's James from the New York City Comptroller's office. I have a few announcements for you. I'll start with one that I gave last time just want to reiterate it so comptroller stringer and our labor Law bureau have put out a database where you can search the names of people who are owed money because the companies that got city, money or city got they got city contracts to do. Work for the city did not pay their workers fairly. So we have pages and pages and pages of names. We have a database, you can punch in the name of your friend or your family member, to see if anyone you know is owed money. We've given two million dollars of unclaimed wages back to people since the middle of March and, as I've said previously, a lot of the people on that database. They have their last known address listed either in community board three or in the adjacent areas like Woodside and Elmhurst, and the southern portion of Corona. So please take a look I'll put it into the chat. Once again, I also want to say that we just put out our 21st edition of the economic and fiscal outlook newsletter. This has a lot of information about. What's going on in the city in terms of the recovery and in terms of the impact of coronavirus on the economy, there's a lot of facts and figures there about unemployment, about national trends, there's comparisons between the recovery in New York and the recovery and in the country at large. There's a lot of information, also about public transit usage about issues that small businesses are having. You can sign up and subscribe to the newsletter I'll put the link in the chat in a moment and every Monday you'll get an update with the the fiscal forecast. So, if you're interested in getting more updates on the conditions of the cities, please sign up for that all right. Two more things. First, our office just put out a proposal to change well to allow for free community college, no tuition for community colleges within the CUNY system and addition, and in addition to that also pair, that with an increase in workforce development and giving more opportunities to people who have been impacted by the pandemic through underemployment and unemployment. We note- and you can see this in our fiscal outlook newsletter- that I mentioned- that the people who are most impacted during this pandemic are the workers who are lower skilled and who are the ones making less money than average. So typically, a recession impacts the people at the top a lot more than this particular economic slowdown that we're having. So, we think that it's best to retrain people help them with job development programs. So we have a proposal for the expansion of pre- existing programs and ways to connect people who are out of work or out of school who could use upgrades in their skills to help them with the new economy? All right. Thank you, James! Okay, we have one more thing. Okay, actually, maybe I've maybe slipped my mind now, nah all right leave it at that all right. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Lily are you on? I guess you may not be on right now: okay, Michelle, can you hear me? Oh, go sorry lily and then Michelle all right go ahead. Lily good evening, everyone from Assemblyman Aubry's office glad everyone could get together. It's almost like a party now I just like to say our office is open. We are taking constituents by appointment. Only if you can call us 718-, 457- 3615, we can make arrangements and if you have any questions up for the upcoming election or need any assistance, please give us a call. I just want to say, stay safe and please get out and vote. Thank you have a good night all right, and I do not think I mentioned in mine. I think that the DOH did mention so please, everyone, if you need to if you have not done it, already, get tested, get tested, get tested or covered 19. Michelle, D Hernandez, and this is Michelle Hernandez from the Office of Congresswoman Ocasso Cortez. Last week the congresswoman hosted her October town Hall, alongside Representative Blumenauer, who represents Portland Oregon, and so the event was focused on environmental justice and housing justice and the unique challenges that both of our districts faced and if you were not able to attend. We have these town halls recorded on our facebook page and, if you'd like to get information for future town halls, I will share links to sign up to our newsletters, where you can find out information about future events, as well as what the congresswoman in our office has been doing over the past month or a few weeks, and when, whenever we send out our summaries or legislative summaries. So three legislative updates, the first one being that last month, the congresswoman and Senator Chuck Schumer FEMA to release funeral assistance to families of Covid-19 victims. This was something that the congresswoman requested back in the spring and they're pushing FEMA to do so again and to consider this to provide relief to New York state, of course, as well, and to get these this important funding over to families who already I'm suffering going through a hard time. The second item is that congressional leaders reached an agreement to fund the government through December 11th and within that bill there was a portion of money allocated to a pandemic relief, a nutrition program, and so it's eight billion dollars for nutrition benefits. And if you have a child- or you know someone who has a child that goes to public school, that they will be receiving money from this bill, it's 420 per child, and so I just be on the lookout for that hold on to the card that they send you so that in case that there is a second wave of funding, you have that, but again any family that has a children going to public schools in New York. They will be receiving that money that the federal government set aside for nutrition benefits and then the last item is that the House passed the Heroes act at the start of this month and within that there is direct cash assistance and financial support for families, regardless of immigration status, housing support and as well as money for the state and city that is pending. But it's something that the congresswoman fought for and so we're going to wait to see what happens on the Senate two items, one briefly on the census. It wrapped up. We want to say a big thank you for everyone that did work around the census. I know Community Board three did a lot of amazing work, and so we want to say a big thank you and the congresswoman is upset that this was cut early, but she does want to give a special thank you for all of those who really went out of their way, especially during you know these difficult times to encourage people to sign up for the census. And then the last thing that I want to mention is: we are honoring community members who were lost due to Covid-19 and also recognizing neighbors and community members who have just gone above and beyond, to support the community, and so, if you have lost a loved one or you want to celebrate someone in the community, that has been doing a lot of work. We have two different programs I'll share links, so you can give that information to our office and we've been I'm sharing these stories of individuals on social media just to recognize those again who have gone out of their way to help our community, but also honor those who have lost their lives during this difficult time, and that's all on me have a great evening all right- and I just wanted to say one more thing- I'd like to thank all the board members and definitely the U.S census that came out to do to assist when we went to give out mass the census. The U.S Census Bureau was always with us and also New York City Census representatives were also helpful and also queensborough office. Susie and Tim from the office they've been very helpful when we were going out there and members. If you know of anywhere that you think that are in need of mass, please let me know because we still have the opportunity to go out there and distribute mass. So the last person Takoya good evening, everyone, my name, is sequoia with council member Moya's office. So what we have been up to since our last meeting, as you know, it is flu season and it's very important for people to get their annual flu shots. Last weekend we did partner with Elmhur Elmhurst hospital to provide free flu shots and thank you to Michelle Dustin, the president of left, Rock, City, tenants, Association and all the volunteers who came out. We will have several flu shots. Events coming up throughout the district. I do know November 7th. We will be having one here in East Elmhurst also. Last week we also had food distribution at Corona ambulance and fresh french produce at Placa de La Soul throughout the health Pocket Program Councilman memorial funded. We have had many community cleanups, where we all roll up our sleeves and the amazing volunteers come out and they allocate and take pride in their community. The great folks at eighth, alongside City Agencies sanitation parks, Department come out, and we all do this together. We do have one coming up: October 30th at Hinton, Park from 10 A.M to 1:00, Councilmember Moya allocated a 160,000 in funding for DSNY and ace programs. So things of the new services has made a real difference within our district. Unfortunately, we do still see a lot of illegal dumping. So if you have happened to come across, any illegal dumping sites feel free to reach out to our office, as we continue to work closely with DSNY and AIDS. To tackle these issues also, we did focus on the topic of parks, with we had a meeting with 115 precincts in the sports leagues to discuss the quality of life issues that our office have been hearing from local residents based with Hinton Park. So that is another reason why we're doing the cleanup there so also a couple of highlights that we have for the council member I've allocated another round of funding to the local restaurants and partnerships with hispanic Federation to prepare and distribute thousands of cook meals for families in need, and we also have the free drive- in movies at flesh and Meadow Corona park funded by the council member there's so many great movies. Last week we did have black panther and coming up, we will have coco in the night before Christmas. So if you would like to come visit, I will definitely put the rooftop films link in the chat and it definitely will be a great way to get and get outside and enjoy a movie with all social distancing again, okay, no that's it! I just want to thank everybody and thanks CB3. I will believe my information in the chat, so you've got any questions or concerns feel free to reach out to me have a great night. All right, you have a great night anything else. I call for any other questions concerns before we log off all right. I call for a motion to end our meeting at 9:54 P.M. I second all in favor heard hi all right have a beautiful evening and I'm recording things from the chat. Okay, all righty. I appreciate that. Yes, do not close that I'm tweeting things out. Okay, I mean the idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me. I'm going to take that off now, I'm stopping.
