We'll call for like three questions and the first three people , we're in a state of emergency, and we wanted to make sure please community ward, number three minutes or March.

Okay, it's when we open up our meetings by doing the pledges Pledge of Allegiance, followed by adopting the agenda motions by committee, chairpersons, district managers report Some of you may need to return rotate the minutes, because I think it's in my bro Then, we'll file all business new business, The chat out of the people.
You know a few years ago, dr Massey had a great vision of creating a global health department, recognizing that some of the concerns healthcare in the future are not bound by border but are actually a global condition, and so we wanted to make sure that we were keeping our eye on the ball and being able to be prepared for a situation, unfortunately, that we find ourselves in today, where pathogens and disease and illness and trans send the entire globe and how we can work together to get partners and how we can be able to orally go ahead.
The head of global health It gives them welcome him to our conversation and to be able to discuss the issues, but also I would have this opportunity before he presents to answer any questions that the board may have Elmer's hospitals here, we're ready to serve reusing and working with our staff to be here at this time of importance for our whole community and we're making sure that we have all the resources available to treat and serve the greater Queens community.
The city health department strongly recommends against testing People, who have no symptoms, are only mild symptoms unless somehow, knowing the diagnosis may impact on our management and I'll come to how that might be In a little while home isolation should be concerned , I should be considered for people were thought to have this infection, even if it isn't proven, and that will minimize the exposure of health care workers.
We don't want to keep repeatedly exposing health care workers by having people who are minimally symptomatic come to the hospital for treatment Also.
We want to reduce the community demand for personal protective equipment, It's really needed by the health care workers, complicating this a little bit more Unfortunately during those initial few days.
Anything and I would point out one really important thing that it's easy for all of us to somehow lose track of, and that is because you don't have this infection today We have to be careful that we don't do endless testing of people where it doesn't really mean anything there.
General infection control measures, washing your hands with soap and water You can find stay home if you're, sick, The CDC does not recommend that people who are well walk around wearing a face mask, but in the hospital Increasingly we are doing that in order to protect vulnerable people from us In case we are have early signs of the infection, but we have to be careful that we don't use up all the surgical masks by people using them in the community who don't really need them if you've returned recently within 14 days from a country where there is a lot of this infection, You can return to work, but you have to check your temperature twice a day and monitor yourself carefully for respiratory symptoms and that's the type of advice that they need just to cover their cloth and remain as far away from people as they can over the next 14 days in the hospital.
There have been several studies that show that the virus is actually cleared from respiratory secretions after about six days in patients receiving that vaccine development There's a lot of politics around this I can just summarize by saying there will not be an effective vaccine, that's widely available for at least a year and a half two years or variety of companies that are working on vaccines, but the way vaccines are marketed, They have to be proven to be effective, they have to be tested in small preclinical trials and then clinical trials and then comparative trials, and that takes a long time and I would just remind everybody that when there is a vaccine for this Unlike the flu vaccine, where every year it is a struggle to get everybody who should take it to take it.
Ah meters, they update the global picture, it's very hurry up to date several times during the day, and if anybody is just interested in seeing what the pattern of this is worldwide, including in the United States I, would strongly encourage you to try that one means community board number three We have a number of questions that were posted in the chat area and Kevin Hughes Macy folks may ask you to go back and forth in your presidency.
It would have been just a handful currently in the hospital because of the problem in getting test results which is on the verge of being solved, but since they can take several days, we have both confirmed cases and people under investigation.
The situation in Russia is always a little difficult to interpret and since we know we had a an AIDS project in Russia for ten years and they were very reluctant to report their AIDS statistics, so I'm in touch with Russian physicians in st Petersburg When we get the rapid turnaround on testing That will make things much more simple for us and, as this outbreak converts into a very large-scale outbreak nationally, we will see much more of attention much more attention over toward treatment of hospitalized patients, because there will be so many and away from community testing which has taken up a lot of our resources.
Who don't have any symptoms, and if we encounter one of those people and are in too close proximity, we can catch this and we can catch it even though we were tested the day before You know answer your first question : If you have been infected with this and you have an adequate host response, we are hoping very hard and assuming that you will have immunity to further infection, if once you have been infected and that may be what happened in China That may be why the outbreak there seemed to come down so quickly.
Every time I go on TV every time, I go on the radio is that I tell people now is not the time to panic and so I think it's really important that we reiterate that it's not a time to panic and in fact again it can make it worse, because if you are sniffling or have a cough and run to the hospital at very mild symptoms, we're gonna make the situation worse for everybody, because we need to free up the hospitals for the doctors and nurses and health care providers so that they can treat people that are in critical condition.
I cannot tell you how important you Nuala, and everyone in this call is in making sure that we get we start building, and you want to make sure that people in your community are taken care of talk to your postal worker and just ask them say, hey!
I'm on my block , I love, Sam I'm, talking about the war driver and taxi drivers at the amount like an employee and I'm, not even like a small business, So I, don't know what kind of assistance are available to them, because they are the most hard-working people and there's a tens of thousand of them in your district, and this is kind of what I was also I- alluded to this earlier in that I'm trying to make sure that all of our federal policy also includes gig workers hourly contract workers, because this is where they put in all of these loopholes where they say: Oh we'll, expand unemployment, insurance or right now, for example, the state has paid leave for all workers, but it requires you to be an employer and, more and more recently, a lot of these big companies, whether it's uber or whether it's you know shipped or GrubHub, has to do with universal basic income.
One thing that I can say is that, if, for whatever reason and you haven't been able to work, I would again encourage folks to look at the unemployment insurance policies and to file, and you know, I- think it's really important that everyone starts getting the help and applying for the help as quickly as they can so, first and foremost, and we have secured a commitment from the administration that the public charge rule will be waived for undocumented members of our community and you use Medicare or Medicaid.
You know: we've had the World Health Organization offer testing protocols, and so what happened was that the Trump administration did not take up those offers early enough We have not had enough tests and that now that's resulted in what you're, seeing in that kind of wealthy and powerful people seem to be able to access a test like if you're, a sports, star, The good news.
That does not mean that you will be negative next week, I think as we roll out testing, it really should be concentrated on people who have at least mild symptoms or a known contact with a case As testing gets rolled out more and more we're not going to know that yet III don't think testing if you're feeling How long.
You had symptoms of that you would go take medicines to relieve the symptoms, so I think that's the situation we're in with this now Would you get immune and my second part of the question was more food slick likely for the congresswoman, but you've been talking about it, but every gathering has been canceled like in stadiums any place that gathered a lot of people is, being you know, top being close, but they don't say nothing about churches, They, Pentecostal, Church, there's a lot of Pentecostal church, all over New York City, where they gather 40, 50 people and I'm sure they're gonna get together and concern me because the more people get sick, the more chances you got to become sick by then to by getting you know close to them, which I tried to stay away, but is heart Think right now the state is recommending that groups any bigger than 10 or 15 people are dangerous.
More and more people are identified as having the infection, that's going to become a more and more difficult process, but that's why we have a Public, Health, Department I think we have to be careful not to assume hospitals can do more than they're going to be doing anyway, just taking care of their very sick.
But I do think that what we're going to find in the next couple of weeks is that the as the number of very sick people, rapidly Rises and hospitals are increasingly busy taking care of them that the entire issue of testing will have to be on the back burner somewhat If you have cold symptoms, I think even if it is Co vid 19, most people who have this recover from it nicely you're, better off, staying home, staying away from other people and not exposing other people, but we live in New York There are people who may have five roommates there, people who have no roommates there, people who have young children in the house, people who are living with pregnant women There are all kinds of scenarios, and we really do too on our Public Health Service in New York City in New York State to really help the hospitals with that contact Are they able to still be in contact or visited by their family or do they themselves become quarantine and isolate.
We, don't want to overload the testing capacity, it's been delicate to begin with, it'll expand eventually, but, as I said a little while ago, I think a couple of weeks from now we're going to be soaked and absolutely consumed with taking care of people who actually are sick.
, you can look at the CDC website, The state, the city health department has, should you actually be tested and I would refer you to those websites and I've listed a couple of them at the end of my lecture, Thank You Reverend Peter heron get in that the employee population Savion the guarantee cause of have you seen any patients arm or what is done for the homeless shelters or for those people who are home on the streets and I think this is obviously a major concern.
It's never a good thing to have thousands of people who are homeless, as we do right now, and it's something we have a lot of experience with, and the public hospitals in general, and certainly specifically at Elmer's We, will send out the presentation to the board members any member any one for the public , dr Massey Thank You, mr Rocha Thank, You, attea, Butler, Thank, You, Ellmers hospital and all you do for our community here, Thank you doctor, but bernetta before we move on Jessica from the mayor's Community Affairs Unit I think she may have So, while we wait for her Zecharia Boyer from the public advocate's office also had a comment that he wanted to make in regard to the doctors.
