Okay, if you need, if you're a caller hmm, you know what let me bring in Renetta Giovanna, there's really no way for the people that are on that are calling in for them to communicate with me that they need to say something.
Well, I'd like to welcome everyone to our March meeting , I'm, so happy that everyone dialed in, as you know, we're in a state of emergency, and we wanted to make sure please community, Ward, number three minutes or March I, like to thank the staff at the office to make sure that we could meet today.
We will have committee meetings at home, so I want everyone cabinets going to open up the lines But, as you know, there's about how many people on the line here right, now- thirty of us.
The reports that will were all a different committee chair that we'll be presenting today, But we'll open up the presentation by Elmer's hospital, followed by our congresswoman, should be coming in The virus.
Ago, Dr. Massey had a great vision of creating a global health department, recognizing that some of the concerns healthcare in the future are not bound by border but are actually a global condition, and so we wanted to make sure that we were keeping our eye on the ball and being able to be prepared for a situation, unfortunately, that we find ourselves in today, where pathogens and Disease and illness and Trans send the entire globe and how we can work together to get partners and how we can be able to orally go ahead.
It gives them welcome him to our conversation and to be able to discuss the issues, but also I would have this opportunity before he presents to answer any questions that the board may have: Elmer's hospitals, here, we're ready to serve reusing and working with our staff to be here at this time of importance for our whole community And, we're making sure that we have all the resources available to treat and serve the greater Queens, community.
Okay, wonderful, then I'm going to go ahead and turn it over now to let you know, we may have a break in the presentation because we are having our Congress when they come on like around 8 o'clock.
Now, I'm being careful about that, because we do not know what's coming next in those countries, mainland China put a lot of the population under restrictions.
They had over 700 million people under some kind of restriction for about a month, particularly in the area right around Wuhan, and they brought their outbreak, at least in reported cases.
Of what a latency period means is the time in between more exposure to the virus seems to have occurred and the onset of symptoms that latency period is very unfortunate for coded 19, because it indicates a period during which an individual may not have symptoms at all, and we know now that during the latency period the infection can be transmitted of these 181 symptomatic cases.
Armies of enforcers went door to door, Check temperatures and patients with fevers in Wuhan will remove from their homes and placed in quarantine centers in Singapore, which is a considerably less militant environment, but a lot more controlled and organized than ours is early cases and really almost all the cases in Singapore were traceable to China.
They had very early availability of rapid testing for this, and they quarantine people on site within hours of identifying them and Singapore has had a very successful approach to their outbreak, and it is nearly under control.
These opportunities, where people congregate together, has been a very good strategy in our country, and hopefully it will pay off, and what we're doing in hospitals, of course, is improving capacity to identify patients and to hospitalize those who were sick, and what we're hoping is the curve on the right will be.
We do not want to keep repeatedly exposing health care workers by having people who are minimally symptomatic come to the hospital for treatment.
We are have early signs of the infection, but we have to be careful that we do not use up all the surgical masks by people using them in the community who do not really need them if you've returned recently within 14 days from a country where there is a lot of this infection, Particularly now Italy, Western, Europe, Iran, etc.
And, that's the type of advice that they need just to cover their cloth and remain as far away from people as they can over the next 14 days in the hospital.
These have to be fit tested, and we do this as an exercise every year for all the healthcare workers who take care of patients in our Hospital.
We hope, not hospital supply issues, we think, will be manageable, but we're not sure vaccine I've talked about and Antiviral drugs, Probably sooner there will be data on these.
It would have been just a handful currently in the hospital because of the problem in getting test results which is on the verge of being solved, but since they can take several days, we have both confirmed cases and people under investigation, the confirmed cases we have about 25 or 30 in the hospital right.
As this outbreak converts into a very large- scale outbreak nationally, we will see much more of attention, much more attention over toward treatment of hospitalized patients, because there will be so many and away from community testing which has taken up a lot of our resources, so far, so, all of us in New, York City, very cognizant of how this could get much worse.
More than 70% alcohol like Purell, seem to be effective, but you know these are simple pieces of advice that we would give in any spreading infection really And I think that's an important part of lowering our curve in this country.
All right, You all have a lot more health care and kind of the medical and science related questions, so We've been in constant communication with the heads of every hospital in our in our congressional district.
And, so I think it's really important that we reiterate that it's not a time to panic and in fact again it can make it worse, Because if you are sniffling or have a cough and run to the hospital at very mild symptoms, we're going to make the situation worse for everybody, because we need to free up the hospitals for the doctors and nurses and health care providers so that they can treat people that are in critical, condition.
And, you think it's getting bad call your doctor They can get you to a place to get the care that you need, but the safest place that you can be is your home, so make sure-.
The state has issued a 90-day moratorium on mortgages, so the landlord can't tell you know right.
The actual we can for the Community Board information on the moratorium, but basically it's need- Now the restaurants have been closed in the city, and so that you know , I would presume also means that your landlord would also be in need because he would lose a tenant.
I think they know who the people are, who are elderly or not leaving their homes?
You want to make sure that people in your community are taken care of talk to your postal worker and just ask them say, hey!
I love, Sam, I'm, talking about the war driver and taxi drivers at the amount like an employee, And I'm, not even like a small business, So I do not know what kind of assistance are available to them, because they are the most hard- working people and there's a tens of thousand of them in your district.
The state has paid leave for all workers, but it requires you to be an employer, and, more and more recently, a lot of these big companies, whether it's uber or whether it's you know shipped or GrubHub. And so it's that's why the bill right, now , that's being debated in the house in the Senate, has to do with universal basic income, so we're trying to get cash assistance to everybody, no matter what you do, who you work for, or what your status is.
Rule that is, scaring people out of going to school and applying for assistance, and things like that, you, will.
You know: we've had the World Health Organization offer testing protocols, and so what happened was that the Trump administration did not take up those offers early enough We have not had enough tests and that now that's resulted in what you're, seeing in that kind of wealthy and powerful people seem to be able to access a test like First of all, Trump has kind of left the governors of every state to be on their own.
Every day, and so the Good News is that the numbers are starting to really tick up on the tests right now in the state of New York and we're working with our neighbors with new jury, Pennsylvania Connecticut and making sure that everyone around us is getting their testing up.
We are setting up a testing and a treatment tent in Elmhurst Hospital that went up today, We are working to get to the point where you can.
Once the tests are available, do you have a plan of how you're going to get them to the people?
When these tests are available, they will be free to you right, now, they're, going to roll out in a level that, in which, like first they'll, be able to be administered from a health professional.
We can get to a point where you can test yourself in your home, but right now it looks like the path is going to be.
I think it's very important that if you have no symptoms of this coming to be tested to any site like that is going to potentially put you on a long line where you would be exposed to the public and if you were testing negative, keep in mind.
It really should be concentrated on people who have at least mild symptoms or a known contact with a case, And I think as testing gets rolled out more and more, we're not going to know that yet III do not think testing if you're feeling How long.
Do you think this mass quarantine, although isolation of people generally, is going to take place?
We have to keep in mind that the whole outbreak is very likely to get worse for at least another month now, what that's going to mean in terms of advice to home, quarantine, etc.
All that did they answer, and my question was: If you get immune to the virus, once you get it Would you get immune and my second part of the question was more food slick likely for the congresswoman, but you've been talking about it, but every gathering has been canceled like in stadiums any place that gathered a lot of people, is, being you know, top being close, but they do not say nothing about churches, They, Pentecostal, Church, there's a lot of Pentecostal church, all over New York City, where they gather 40:50 people and nobody has say anything about it.
I'm sure they're going to get together and concern me because the more people get sick, the more chances you got to become sick by then to by getting you know close to them, which I tried to stay away, but is heart, you're, absolutely right,, Right now the state is recommending that groups Any bigger than 10 or 15.
My, wife and myself and a lot of people I know obviously are working from home this week and for the foreseeable future.
You, know, I, think my wife, who's, retired and is stuck at home, is having those same questions and she likes to walk.
I think we have to be careful not to assume hospitals can do more than they're going to be doing.
What's going on around us and to help in identifying people who we think might have been exposed.
But I do think that what we're going to find in the next couple of weeks is that the as the number of very sick, people, rapidly Rises and hospitals are increasingly busy taking care of them that the entire issue of testing will have to be on the back burner.
The city hospital system in New, York They are extremely aggressive and very good at getting the equipment they need.
You know we're working on several strategies to provide testing so that people would not have to come through the emergency department.
It'll expand, eventually, but, as I said a little while ago, I think a couple of weeks from now we're going to be soaked and absolutely consumed with taking care of people who actually are sick.
She's working, 24/7 I think she may have I'm going to end While we wait for her Zecharia Boyer from the public advocate's office also had a comment that he wanted to make in regard to the doctors.
We will be sending out information from the public advocate's office on our social medias, so that people can know when they can call in and which number to call for different religions.
We did not know this for sure, but there are 240 bars within our community board and obviously many of them are on Roosevelt Avenue And he's going to check their SLA authorization.
A, scoping, meeting, I believe on March 5th, but we did ask them to come to us because we want to see what they're going to do specifically Thank you and everybody stay safe.
We hold on one second I'm going to mute, everyone, okay, Renetta, your life, yes, I, know: I, said this chair that youth Services Planning committee and a number of our young people that are expecting to walk for graduation.
