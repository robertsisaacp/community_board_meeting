Okay, if you need, if you're a caller hmm, you know what let me bring in Renetta Giovanna, there's really no way for the people that are on that are calling in for them to communicate with me that they need to say something.
I'm so happy that everyone dialed in, as you know, we're in a state of emergency We wanted to make sure please community ward, number three minutes or March.
We will have committee meetings at home, so I want everyone, cabinets, gonna, open up the lines but, as you know, there's about how many people on the line here right, now, thirty of us.
The, director of the hospital followed by him around 8 o'clock, darling into our Hall Okay, when we did okay, I'm gonna, go back through some of the people that didn't answer when I caught when I held their name just to see if they're in So for those of you who just joined us II, the those of you that are on the on a computer tablet or smartphone, there is a chat option where you can send me or the entire group, a private message or a message to everyone regarding a technical issue that you may be having, or perhaps you want to ask the question or something so.
Massey had a great vision of creating a global health department, recognizing that some of the concerns healthcare in the future are not bound by border but are actually a global condition, and so we wanted to make sure that we were keeping our eye on the ball and being able to be prepared for a situation, unfortunately, that we find ourselves in today, where pathogens and disease and illness and trans send the entire globe and how we can work together to get partners and how we can be able to orally go ahead.
They had over 700 million people under some kind of restriction for about a month, particularly in the area right around Wuhan, and they brought their outbreak, at least in reported cases under dramatic control.
They had very early availability of rapid testing for this and they quarantine people on site within hours of identifying them and Singapore has had a very successful approach to their outbreak, and it is nearly under control.
These opportunities, where people congregate together, has been a very good strategy in our country, and hopefully it will pay off, and what we're doing in hospitals, of course, is improving capacity to identify patients and to hospitalize those who were sick, and what we're hoping is the curve on the right will be.
We don't want to keep repeatedly exposing health care workers by having people who are minimally symptomatic come to the hospital for treatment.
We are have early signs of the infection, but we have to be careful that we don't use up all the surgical masks by people using them in the community who don't really need them if you've returned recently within 14 days from a country where there is a lot of this infection , You can return to work, but you have to check your temperature twice a day and monitor yourself carefully for respiratory symptoms.
And, that's the type of advice that they need just to cover their cloth and remain as far away from people as they can over the next 14 days in the hospital.
These have to be fit tested, and we do this as an exercise every year for all the healthcare workers who take care of patients in our Hospital.
We hope, not hospital supply issues we think will be manageable, but we're not sure vaccine I've talked about and antiviral drugs.
They update the global picture, it's very hurry up to date several times during the day, and if anybody is just interested in seeing what the pattern of this is worldwide, including in the United States I, would strongly encourage you to try that one Means community board number three We have a number of questions that were posted in the chat area and Kevin Hughes.
It would have been just a handful currently in the hospital because of the problem in getting test results which is on the verge of being solved, but since they can take several days, we have both confirmed cases and people under investigation, the confirmed cases we have about 25 or 30 in the hospital right.
As this outbreak converts into a very large-scale outbreak nationally, we will see much more of attention, much more attention over toward treatment of hospitalized patients, because there will be so many and away from community testing which has taken up a lot of our resources so far.
Undoubtedly right now who have it, who don't have any symptoms, and if we encounter one of those people and are in too close proximity, we can catch this and we can catch it, even though we were tested the day, before.
You all have a lot more health care and kind of the medical and science related questions, so I just want to pop in and let you all know just give you a quick update.
We are seeing some rising cases, but really we're starting to see that surge a little bit more in Queens, and so we are all trying to mobilize in making sure that every hospital is trying to coordinate and support each other as much as possible.
We need to now push so that it's Universal paid leave, and you know from our district and our community I'm, keeping an extra eye out and really making sure that we're pushing policies for hourly workers, gig, workers, contract workers and freelancers, because those are the folks that tend to get left out sometimes or the policy isn't written in the best way to include their needs as well.
We're gonna make the situation worse for everybody, because we need to free up the hospitals for the doctors and nurses and health care providers so that they can treat people that are in critical, condition.
I think they know who the people are, who are elderly or not leaving their homes.
You want to make sure that people in your community are taken care of talk to your postal worker and just ask them say:: hey!
So I, don't know what kind of assistance are available to them, because they are the most hard-working people and there's a tens of thousand of them in your district.
You do not have to worry that you know if you are exhibiting symptoms and you go to the hospital You will not be subject to the public charge rule that is, scaring people out of going to school and applying for assistance, and things like that.
You know: we've had the World Health Organization offer testing protocols, and so what happened was that the Trump administration did not take up those offers early enough We have not had enough tests and that now that's resulted in what you're, seeing in that kind of wealthy and powerful people seem to be able to access a test like if you're, a sports, star.
We are really working hard to ramp up the testing in the state and we are testing more and more people every day, and so the good news is that the numbers are starting to really tick up on the tests right now in the state of New York and we're working with our neighbors with new jury, Pennsylvania Connecticut and making sure that everyone around us is getting their testing up.
But, we don't have an immediate timeline of I, don't want to give you a false timeline, but What I can say is that we're starting to ramp up the tests more and more, every single day, And we are setting up a testing and a treatment tent in Elmhurst Hospital that went up today right now, it's by appointment, only, but we are working to get to the point.
They're gonna, roll out in a level that in which, like first they'll, be able to be administered from a health professional, so a nurse or a doctor or another healthcare or a physician's assistant, would have to administer the test to you right, now.
We can get to a point where you can test yourself in your home, but right now it looks like the path is going to be.
I think it's very important that if you have no symptoms of this coming to be tested to any site like that is going to potentially put you on a long line where you would be exposed to the public and if you were testing negative, keep in mind.
As testing gets rolled out more and more, we're not going to know that yet III, don't think testing if you're feeling How long.
Do you think this mass quarantine, although isolation of people generally, is going to take place?
And you're, staying away from other people and isolation, which means you're known to be infected, And you're told to stay in your home right, now.
Would you get immune and my second part of the question was more food slick likely for the congresswoman, but you've been talking about it, but every gathering has been canceled like in stadiums any place that gathered a lot of people, is, being you know, top being close, but they don't say nothing about churches, They, Pentecostal, Church, there's a lot of Pentecostal church, all over New York City, where they gather 40, 50 people and , they're, gonna get together and concern me because the more people get sick, the more chances you got to become sick by then to by getting you know close to them, which I tried to stay away, but is heart, you're, absolutely right.
My, wife and myself and a lot of people I know obviously are working from home this week and for the foreseeable future.
You, know, I, think my wife, who's, retired and is stuck at home, is having those same questions and she likes to walk.
All of us, though, have to recognize how large a problem this is in a city, this big, and we have to do our best to understand what's going on around us and to help in identifying people who we think might have been exposed.
But I do think that what we're going to find in the next couple of weeks is that the as the number of very sick, people, rapidly Rises and hospitals are increasingly busy taking care of them that the entire issue of testing will have to be on the back burner.
There are all kinds of scenarios, and we really do too on our Public Health Service in New York City in New York State to really help the hospitals with that contact.
Doctors I do well Renetta, wanted me to open the floor to some of the callers, the people that were calling in My question to him.
You know we're working on several strategies to provide testing so that people wouldn't have to come through the emergency department.
With, it'll expand, eventually, but, as I said a little while ago, I think a couple of weeks from now we're going to be soaked and absolutely consumed with taking care of people who actually are sick.
We will be sending out information from the public advocate's office on our social medias, so that people can know when they can call in and which number to call for different religions.
This is our closed right, now, so they're suffering greatly as we need to seen everyone the little people we do turn this economy or anything else, things.
