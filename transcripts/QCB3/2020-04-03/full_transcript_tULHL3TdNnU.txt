This conference will now be recorded. Did everyone get the link with all of the documents? Yes, I know that the minute factory you have to rotate it, but I'll try to put it back in the directory rotated after roll call. We're asking everyone and Kevin is going to repeat this to put their phone on mute and if you do not want to see the, but you can review the documentation while you are waiting at 7:15 p.m. Kevin will begin calling roll call I'll introduce the comedian 7:30, but he'll begin calling real Cole, because we've asked all of the board members blogging early, make sure we're all in have any background noise. Please turn it off or put it on mute. Please I've been in which one are you yeah you're one of the caller's, so I think you're, caller number two say something: okay, if you're caller number two okay I have to just make a note of who you are in the I would matter hello, I'm, fine right, oh eh, see AV that Elmer Elmer's Hospital, correct Elmhurst, mr. Rocha he'll be very with everyone. We're gonna start our meeting at 7:30 and we'll introduce him and we're going to make you a presenter. Okay, I forgot my hello, yeah I'm. Still on Peralta food. I, don't see you were you everyone, mother phone, you remember every meeting you get a folder. Well, you have your virtual frame. It's through Google, so I hope you were able to access it with all the documents, but I know some of it can eat now and it may have downloaded on your computer as a zip file, so it will all dumped into a Google Drive. No, but if anything okay wait hold on, can you say something? Okay, we'll be in my house talking with I can't hear you calling talking to mr. Smith. This is Kevin mr. Smith, this is Kevin Hughes. How are you okay? Can you hear me yeah? You know, okay, great, so you're on a conference call there's about. Let's see five there's about 20 people online right now with you, yeah, okay, so you're gonna hear a lot of voices all right. Yes, what are you calling me about? Yeah hear you, but your thing who is calling mute me and you mrs. Smith. Okay, give me a second you Kevin. Yes, the revote. Should we vote in the chat box. No will vote verbally, I'll call your name so you're going to unmute us and then let us vote and then do this again. Yes, I'm probably only going to unmute or mute people when the presenters are on. Can he I did me on the phone Jimmy? Can you hear me yes get miss? Yes, I see you yes, I! Think Renetta called you didn't she at the conference call at home. It's with the board. Yeah dude hold on hi mr. Hollander audio good. How are you it's Kevin, Hugh, dude, yeah, everybody's, safe fans, thought everybody saved the colorful carpet. This is Jimmy, have a caller hold on? Can what did I call me about your? Are you calling me no I'm I'm on the line? No I'm in the computer I'm aware hi, Steve, Comerica I see you I couldn't get in I couldn't get in on a tabloid. This is Jimmy Smith, hi Jimmy. This is going to be a great adventure. There Renetta I was I've, been in Connecticut all day. Getting my daughter, I apologize for not calling me many people are talking in one hello, Kevin. Yes, this is Joyce Julian. It went through. Okay, yeah I had a hard time. What I have to do so many people talk and I. Don't know hi everyone I, just muted everybody, so that I could say something real quick. If I could just have everyone's attention. I'm gonna mute the lines while people are checking in so that it's not so loud. A lot of people are coming in if you need to. If you need me for any reason, shoot me a text on the chat bubble, all the way to the right. Okay, if you need, if you're a caller hmm, you know what let me bring in Renetta Giovanna, there's really no way for the people that are on that are calling in for them to communicate with me that they need to say something. So what we're going to do when it's time for questions we'll say we'll call for like three questions and the first three people. When you see the bubble pop up, you know hopefully I don't know how to identify them right. Well, I'd like to welcome everyone to our March meeting, I'm so happy that everyone dialed in, as you know, we're in a state of emergency and we wanted to make sure please community ward, number three minutes or March meeting I'm happy that it was able and it was doable so I'd like something. You I like to thank miss Reed I, like to thank the staff at the office to make sure that we could meet today will be my in the office. I will be home, I'm working from home right now and we will be. We will have committee meetings at home, so I want everyone, cabinets, gonna, open up the lines but, as you know, there's about how many people on the line here right now, thirty of us. So please wait for Kevin to call your name and then we'll do roll call followed by roll call. Our meeting will begin promptly at 7:30 to the folks at Elmer's hospital. That's supposed to start there. First Wow Israel workshops on Health and Hospitals. The director of the hospital followed by him around 8 o'clock, darling into our Hall, we'll give her presenter right rocha. Please type it in the chat box and we'll see how about a little work with the folks that are talking on the phones. It'll be very difficult. The board members please look at that. Little bubble that has the chat bubble and Kevin will be monitoring it. So Kevin. Are you ready to do roll call? Please just wait for your name. Do not all scream out at the same time: okay, yeah I'm ready! So I'm gonna, unmute, everybody, okay! So no one, don't all talk at the same time. Okay! Now, if you are muted on your end, you need unmute. Okay, I'm gonna. Do roll yes I'm! Here! Please don't talk if I'm not calling your name. Okay! Thank you! Richard Richard, Mullings, Luverne, immense perfect, is here hello. It already yeah, yes, okay, I just went from my phone to computer. I can't see you, but I can hear you. Okay, when we did okay, I'm gonna go back through some of the people that didn't answer when I caught when I held their name just to see if they're in okay, Thank You Kyle all right, I'm gonna put everybody on mute, okay. Yes, we do the rules, the we're going to do everything please good yep. Okay, so for those of you who just joined us II, the those of you that are on the on a computer tablet or smartphone, there is a chat option where you can send me or the entire group, a private message or a message to everyone regarding a technical issue that you may be having, or perhaps you want to ask the question or something so, please use the chat bubble. The caller's, unfortunately, are at a bit of a disadvantage because they do not have a chat option because they're calling in so we will be opening the floor for questions from the callers at certain points, so that, if you have any issues you can raise them at that point. I guess everybody. Yes, I mean I, muted, everyone all right, so you can email it to you to tell her exactly at 7:30 if they can log in now, so that we can share the screen with them. So they can start. You know at least at 7:30 weekends. Okay, here both dr., oh yeah, oh yeah, okay! Well, actually it should be the CEO. Yes see you left Israel, dr. Volkow Israel, all right, so everyone should have had accessibility. So the reports that will were all a different committee chair that we'll be presenting today but we'll open up the presentation by Elmer's hospital followed by our congresswoman, should be coming in and then we'll have our presentation on the VAR. The virus, this file with by two public hearings and our chairs are both here. Edmund is here physically and virtually we see Ed Kernan, so they'll be doing their hearings, we'll open up the session where's our flag, okay, it's when we open up our meetings by doing the pledges Pledge of Allegiance, followed by adopting the agenda motions by committee, chairpersons, district managers report. All of these reports are in that Google Drive link, I sent to you will adopt the February twenty minutes. Some of you may need to return rotate the minutes, because I think it's in my bro take it over it. Committee referrals, I do not know if many of our representatives will be joined on the phone today at the end of our meeting will do our legislators give a few words. Then we'll file all business new business, all right, so whenever you're ready at 7:00 at 7:30 get ready to, but they can't be the CEO. Alright, so Kevin I'm going to make the Elmer's presenter or do you want to do it? Let me see you can click on them. The chat out of the people. You can see the additional members that joined Kevin, yeah, mm-hmm, yeah, I'm gonna, actually call just a few names that weren't in the original role car that were that didn't call out in the original role call okay, so you get to save it again, just unmute that particular person, so they can do their verbal here. Are you alright? Yet I'm gonna have to unmute everybody? Okay, all right, so let me I'm just gonna in about one minute: I'm gonna wait until we hit 7:30 on the DOT, then I'm gonna do the final attendance. Okay last couple of people then I'll make Elmer's hospital. The CEO of the presenter. Excuse me mr. rubric, I use pronounces legislature Rocha. Okay, do you want to just start doing that now, just before I will do it now? Okay, all right is heiko with us. Wait. Let me unmute at everybody. First, all right! Please don't all talk at the same time, because I'm gonna unmute everybody it'll get real loud Casey under Lopez with us. I got a bag, hello. All right, I had to mute everybody, and you could take you have to take the ball. You have to take her. Take her take her most okay. Take Albert's Ospital off him. Okay, give me one second hold on. Did you call all the members we needed to call yeah it was. It was. Hopefully I got everybody. This is leather slippery. Some he I didn't hear my name. I did I got you all right. Thank you, I got you I got you. Mr. Gideon get in yes, okay! Thank you. Okay, yes, explain. I, welcome everyone! That's on the line board members and members of the members are, or the east summers, Jackson Heights, North Corona and wherever else you're dialing welcome to the first community, Ward 3 monthly virtual meeting Kirk. Yes, it is recording okay. We will begin our presentation by the CEO of Elmer's hospital. Mr. ears, Rio Road, Chuck. Are you here, mr. Rocha, we think it's presentation, but we do not see him. Can we put him? Do you see him there? Kevin I can't come guys him. You, though, I see him though I see him Oh, I, guess I can't see. Let me let me do here. You have to scroll through the photos, the cameras. This is our first time, sir doing it. So one I want to start by welcoming everyone and then giving us thanking you for giving us the opportunity to share and be with you today. You know I'm very happy to be joined by dr. Joseph, Massey Global Health here at Elmer's Hospital. You know a few years ago, dr. Massey had a great vision of creating a global health department, recognizing that some of the concerns healthcare in the future are not bound by border but are actually a global condition, and so we wanted to make sure that we were keeping our eye on the ball and being able to be prepared for a situation, unfortunately, that we find ourselves in today, where pathogens and disease and illness and trans send the entire globe and how we can work together to get partners and how we can be able to orally go ahead. Start sorry, so I wanted to make sure that we created a center. That would be able to be able to track illness and pathogens across the globe, and so he, dr. Massey, is our head of Epidemiology he's also the head of global health. He is an infectious disease specialist who was consulted to the United Nations, the CDC, the World Health Organization, and around the country as a foremost expert in pathology and infectious disease, and we're very honored to have him here on our staff. Now what I would like to do is share. It gives them welcome him to our conversation and to be able to discuss the issues, but also I would have this opportunity before he presents to answer any questions that the board may have Elmer's hospitals here, we're ready to serve reusing and working with our staff to be here at this time of importance for our whole community and we're making sure that we have all the resources available to treat and serve the greater Queens community. So we are available and we're here to be able to help, but we're also here to start with helpful information so that we can answer the questions that are on everyone's minds and in hearts. And so, if you would like, we can answer questions or we can proceed to the presentation by dr. Massey. Whatever works best for the board, we're going to have the presentation followed by the presentation, then there'll be questions. Okay, wonderful, then I'm going to go ahead and turn it over now to let you know, we may have a break in the presentation because we are having our Congress when they come on. Like around 8 o'clock, but please continue with the presentation all right. Wonderful, then I'll go ahead and turn it over to dr. Massey and then I'll. Let him start with the presentation. Then we can answer the questions together. Will that work I think the presentation needs to be put in presentation mode because right now, the presentation mode. So let me try that real quickly and we'll try. Something happens. We'll come back in a few seconds. Well, let me try every quickly and everyone, our bar president will be joining the line. Also got it. Can you still hear us and you see the presentation? Yes, we can. Thank you wonderful, then I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to dr. Massey, hello. Everyone can you hear me, can you hear me so doctor I'm, dr. Joseph, Massey I'm, the chairman of global, healthier at Elmhurst and I wanted to go over some aspects of covered 19 now this is changing very fast every day, as we know, and some of the statistics I'll show you are from this morning and they've actually changed somewhat during the day, but let me get started. Let's start with what is a corona virus. Corona viruses are a large group of viruses which insect mammals and birds that cause a lot of different syndromes, they're, basically fairly innocent viruses, though they're primarily respiratory pathogens. They typically cause mild disease like the common cold. They can mutate. Frequently. There are a lot of subspecies of these viruses and in general, they're, spread by human to human transmission once they get into us now. I say that, because there are many other animal hosts in the environment that can carry these viruses and the ultimate definitive host is the bat. So hardly there have been three outbreaks of very different corona viruses in the last 16 years. This was not expected and it's not really fully understood why this happened. These innocent cold viruses have caused outbreaks called such as SARS the severe acute rest, taury syndrome in 2003, 2004 MERS, the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, which began in 2012 and is still continuing and, of course, kovat 19 this year. So how did this start? Well? We all know it seems to have started in China. Exactly when it started is not clear, though, although the Chinese government has said it began at the end of December, there is evidence to suggest in the epidemiologic curves that it probably began a month or two before that. There are several theories as to how it began. We all know about the market in Wuhan China, where it seemed to have been an epicenter for this. In that market they sold live animals, they slaughtered animals for sale, but exactly which animal it is that caused transmission to humans is not known, because the Chinese authorities cleaned out the market before the source could be identified and the investigation could be completed. The latest reported figures on this as of this morning are truly alarming: 230,000 confirmed cases around the world with over 9,000 deaths, 86,000 261. That number is the number of patients who are fully recovered and you see in black 2 countries that had a surge in cases in December and into January and so far has seemed to have brought this outbreak under control. Although that may be changing again, we don't know the countries in yellow are the countries where it's currently exploding? Italy has had a very dramatic problem with this, and since this morning the number of deaths in Italy actually exceed the number of deaths in China. Iran has also had a very peculiar pattern. With this, with a very high mortality rate and over 18,000 cases, Germany and France, the countries of Western Europe are now becoming increasingly involved each day. These are countries where the numbers are rising every day and, of course, the United States. So far as of this morning, we had 10,000 816 cases. Now it's well over 11,000 with 161 deaths, that's gone up as well, and fifteen hundred and fifty-seven cases in the 24 hours before these figures were compiled. This is the map of the world where the virus is, and what's so remarkable about. This is how quickly this really went all the way around the world. There is no continent except Antarctica that has not had cases yet. The cases that you see the red circles are where the concentrations have been so far, but we see cases in South America now in Africa, Australia, etc. So this is really a global outbreak and it was declared a pandemic last week, the each day in the United States. This is data through earlier this week. The number of cases goes up. This is an epidemic curve that we've seen all over the world, but countries have had various patterns with this, as I mentioned mainly in China and South Korea has seemed to have seen the end of their outbreak. Now, I'm being careful about that, because we don't know what's coming next in those countries, mainland China put a lot of the population under restrictions. They had over 700 million people under some kind of restriction for about a month, particularly in the area right around Wuhan, and they brought their outbreak, at least in reported cases under dramatic control. By the beginning of March South Korea had a peak later. It was largely attributed to a religious cults. There they too have had reduction in cases that have been dramatic. You see the epidemic curve. There Iran and Italy have had a different pattern. Of course they have not yet reached their peak and Italy, and both of these countries, but Italy in particular, is on a very tragic course. Right now and there you see the United States and I have Spain there as an example of a Western European country. That's now becoming involved by this in New York State. As of this morning, there were 40 152 cases, 21 deaths. There were almost 2,500 cases in New, York, City and 11 deaths so far and I just point out to everybody I'm sure most. Do you remember this? Two weeks ago there were no cases in New, York City. In fact, there were only 15 cases in the United States. This is a very rapidly moving epidemic. So what are the clinical features of this infection now, based on 181 cases that were analyzed in China? The latency period is three to seven days with a maximum of 14 days of what a latency period means is the time in between more exposure to the virus seems to have occurred and the onset of symptoms that latency period is very unfortunate. For coded 19, because it indicates a period during which an individual may not have symptoms at all, and we know now that during the latency period the infection can be transmitted of these 181 symptomatic cases, half of them develop symptoms within the first five days, nearly all had symptoms by day 12 and they were contagious during the latency period. The symptoms are really quite common, they're familiar to all of us, I think they are flu-like, symptoms of fever, sore throat, dry, cough chills, etc. Shortness of breath is a particularly ominous sign with this and it when it has occurred. It typically has occurred before day 8 and there's been a characteristic pattern with this disease, which is also difficult for us to identify- and that is after that latency period and the onset of nonspecific cold-like symptoms comes a onset of respiratory, lower respiratory symptoms and then, in some cases, a very dramatic decompensation, with the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock and cetera, and that accounts for the fatal cases. The signs, as opposed to the symptoms, the signs shortness of breath, moist rowels in the lungs weakened breath, sounds dullness to percussion. This is over the chest and increased or decreased tactile speech tremor chest. X-Ray findings has been some emphasis on this. The x-rays are fairly nonspecific when they show anything, that's somewhat identifiable there. These peripheral I'll show you a picture in a second, these peripheral, dense consolidations. We don't know exactly how often an identifiable x-ray pattern is present. It would be very helpful if it was, but it even the radiologists, don't believe that this is a reliable enough finding, but it is quite dramatic on the x-ray in some patients- and you see a picture that here is from a case in Korea on the left. You see a plain x-ray and you see the peripheral infiltrates, the middle and right sided cuts are cat scans, showing the peripheral, infiltrates and I'm emphasizing that, because when there is something characteristic about it, it's that the infiltrates are peripheral, they're up against the chest wall and that's unusual, most pneumonias, the infiltrates. The densities in the lung are near where the Airways enter the lung they're near the heart they're not near the chest wall like this, so there may be something characteristic enough in some of these cases to identify a case quickly with the chest x-ray unfortunate cat scan, but unfortunately it's not clear- that's common enough to do that. So what is the differential diagnosis of all of this? Well, of course, during flu season, which is finally coming to an end. Now influenza was the Communist differential diagnosis, but you see here many other respiratory organisms that can mimic many of these findings. Now most of these infections, with the exception of influenza and the exception of bacterial pneumonia, on the right hand, side are our self-limited infections that are fairly manageable and not very symptomatic. Really influenza, we know, is a big killer. There been nearly 20,000 deaths this year from influenza, and this outbreak may quickly overcome influenza statistics. We don't know yet, but the other organisms on this page are relatively innocuous. So what have been the international strategies for containment? These have varied a lot from country to country we're trying to learn some lessons from countries where it's been successfully contained in China after January 23rd about a month after the outbreak was recognized, travel into and out of Wuhan was stopped by January 30 30th adjacent cities were locked down and a total of 50 million really close. Sixty million people were completely locked down. Eventually, there were 760 million people covered by some type of lockdown. Armies of enforcers went door to door, they temp check temperatures and patients with fevers in Wuhan will remove from their homes and placed in quarantine centers in Singapore, which is a considerably less militant environment, but a lot more controlled and organized than ours is early cases, and really almost all the cases in Singapore were traceable to China. There was very little community transmission in Singapore, so they had a very recognizable entry point of their cases. They did very meticulous contact tracing. They had very early availability of rapid testing for this and they quarantine people on site within hours of identifying them and Singapore has had a very successful approach to their outbreak, and it is nearly under control and I again with China, with Singapore with South Korea. Let's keep in mind that the outbreak can research again right now it seems to be under control. South Korea, that was the river of grace Church, where 60% of the cases were directly or indirectly connected to that church. 87 percent of the cases were concentrated around where that church is and I go in the southeast and adjacent north Genson province. This week, though, cases in Seoul for the first time exceeded the cases in those regions, and that is a nominal sign. Although the overall outbreak has been brought under control in South Korea, the cases in Seoul are now beginning to spike a little bit and we may see a resurgence in South Korea. So what I've described to you? It's three different strategies for containing this infection in three different countries and really three different societies so Italy. Why has it been hit so hard Italy? Unfortunately, minors, some of the problems that we have here there was initially very limited access to testing those of you who've been following. This may remember, it was initially thought to be confined to the north eastern areas in Italy, but it was a sooner I said it was all over the country and when I say soon, I mean as soon as testing was accelerated. Italy has had a high death rate, and some of that may be due to the fact that it has a relatively old population in Italy. They have the second oldest population in the world after Japan South Korea, for example, has a much younger average age. Also, smoking is very common among men and women in Italy, in South, Korea, very few women smoke and smoking and smoking related disease may be connected to bad outcomes. With this I show you some information about. Africa is now beginning to emerge as another hotspot for this, as is India I, should say so far in Africa, as of yesterday morning, there were 350 people diagnosed and seven had died. Most cases were in seen in people who were arriving from Europe or North America, but 27 countries, as of yesterday had cases South Africa has been the hardest hit so far and they've closed many of their land crossings and two of their seaports. Foreign nationals, including from our country, have now been banned from South Africa and all schools have been closed. So what are we doing in our country? Well, what we're doing reflects a couple of what we believe are facts about this infection. First of all, how can Dage contagious is the corona virus, but you see towards the bottom of the screen in dark brown and red is corona of this corona virus. It is more contagious than Ebola, which was not very contagious, it's about as contagious as influenza, but it is far less contagious than measles, so it is reasonably contagious. The chart on the right. This is a chart. You see in epidemiology courses a lot. This is a illustration of the number of cases that would arise after exposure to a single patient. With this. Once again, you see measles in the lower right, 17 or 18 cases. After a single exposure, this is back around where SARS is you see it right before right after influenza, with two-and-a-half to three cases after an exposure? So what are we trying to do in this country? The infection is here, the more testing that's done, the more cases are identified and what we should be trying to do and are now trying to do is this is a common illustration of the way in which an epidemic can be ameliorated. On the left, you see a high spiking curve, that's the curve of an uncontrolled pattern of transmission. If nothing was done, that would be the curve we would see here it's a little reminiscent of what they saw in China, but it would be much bigger here because it's popping up in many parts of our country by instituting proactive measures allowing people to isolate at home, avoid social contact etc. The types of things we've been hearing about in talking about and in our country, probably very importantly, closing off stadiums, ending baseball season, football, rather basketball, hockey, seasons, canceling concerts, etc. Removing these opportunities where people congregate together has been a very good strategy in our country, and hopefully it will pay off, and what we're doing in hospitals, of course, is improving capacity to identify patients and to hospitalize those who were sick, and what we're hoping is the curve on the right will be what we see in our country. The dotted line represents the capacity of the u.s. hospital system. It could be rapidly exceeded or could be only slightly exceeded. Depending on how successful these mitigation efforts are. Testing for Cobra 19 has been a problem. There was a very long delay in getting adequate and sufficient testing. Currently, the city health department strongly recommends against testing. People who have no symptoms are only mild symptoms unless somehow, knowing the diagnosis may impact on our management and I'll come to how that might be. In a little while home isolation should be concerned, I should be considered, for people were thought to have this infection, even if it isn't proven, and that will minimize the exposure of health care workers. We really have to be cognizant of that. We don't want to keep repeatedly exposing health care workers by having people who are minimally symptomatic come to the hospital for treatment. Also, we want to reduce the community demand for personal protective equipment. It's really needed by the health care workers complicating this a little bit more. There are false negative tests. Retesting should be considered if a if it is being conducted at all if a patient has a suggestive clinical syndrome and their initial test is negative, just like that initial few days allows for a patient to transmit this without knowing they're infected. Unfortunately, during those initial few days, the diagnostic test may also be negative. So who should we test? We want to focus the testing on people who are actually short of breath. That's the symptom. That is a key, that there is respiratory progression if a person is only mildly ill or not ill. At all. These are guidelines that were published yesterday by Tom Frieden, the former city health commissioner and former director of the CDC. We can use up tests that might be needed by others. People can spread the infection while they're going somewhere to be tested or waiting to be tested on a long line. They could get exposed if they're not already infected by gathering like that. The result may very well not change what a person does or what sort of clinical management they get and, as I just said, a negative test does not mean that you don't have this infection now and then you can't get it and a positive test usually doesn't change. Anything and I would point out one really important thing that it's easy for all of us to somehow lose track of, and that is because you don't have this infection today. It does not mean that you can't get it next week or the week after. So we have to be careful that we don't do endless testing of people where it doesn't really mean anything there. We have no test to demonstrate immunity to this infection. We may have that one day, but we don't right now. Laboratory diagnosis, I'm not going to belabor this. So far it has been a somewhat onerous process, the laboratory facilities from CDC. You probably know about the problems that there were when the CDC tried to distribute their kits, that had to be called back because they were faulty private laboratories have taken over there, many private laboratories that are currently involved in this and we're hoping soon that we will be able to do our testing right here in the hospital for this positive tests are reported to the state and city, rather the State, Health Department and the CDC. How do we protect the staff and our other patients? While this is happening there? General infection control measures washing your hands with soap and water, it's better than better than any Purell. You can find stay home if you're sick. If you can possibly stay home, you should cover your cough and sneeze with a tissue throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. The CDC does not recommend that people who are well walk around wearing a face mask, but in the hospital. Increasingly, we are doing that in order to protect vulnerable people from us. In case, we are have early signs of the infection, but we have to be careful that we don't use up all the surgical masks by people using them in the community who don't really need them if you've returned recently within 14 days from a country where there is a lot of this infection, particularly now Italy, Western, Europe, Iran, etc. You can return to work, but you have to check your temperature twice a day and monitor yourself carefully for respiratory symptoms. I was just giving it advice before I came here to a person who has a relative who just got back from Japan and that's the type of advice that they need just to cover their cloth and remain as far away from people as they can over the next 14 days in the hospital every patient who's under investigation. That means a patient who an initial assessment is thought to possibly have this. It's given a surgical mask to where the patient is placed as far away from others as possible in a well ventilated space, they're placed in a negative pressure room if they, if they're one and one is available, and if they are in a negative pressure room, they can take their mask off. The providers are required to place themselves in personal protective equipment. The current standard is a surgical mask or an n95 mask they're thought to be equally protective of providers. One pair of gloves eye protection, which consists of a face shield or goggles, and an isolation. Gown poppers are cappers. These motorized devices are in short supply and they may be a solution for some healthcare workers under some circumstances. These are the masks I'm talking about on the left. You see a surgical mask the way you tell a surgical mask from other types of masks. It has the loops that go only around your ears. Anybody can wear this. You have to keep it over your nose and mouth. It would have to be effective at all, and this is primarily to protect other people from you on the right. You see the n95 respirator n95 means it filters out, 95% of particles above a certain size. These have to be fit tested, and we do this as an exercise every year for all the healthcare workers who take care of patients in our Hospital, the mask fits tightly and it is to protect the wearer from infection. The loops on the side go around the back of the head, and this is a very different undertaking than placing a surgical mask on. If you don't know how to wear an n95 respirator, if you've never been trained to do it and fit test, it may not be any more protective than wearing a surgical mask for hospitalized patients. Common things are done for these patients. We treat their water and electrolyte imbalances. We monitor certain markers in their blood c-reactive protein and procalcitonin are particularly effective. Interestingly, the liver function tests were abnormal in virtually all the cases that were seen in Washington State last week, so we certainly looked carefully at those, but respiratory support is the key maneuver that we're using. This is divided into three categories in terms of respiratory support. People with mild to moderate and symptoms just require supportive care. These are the patient who can be sent home for severe respiratory symptoms where there is an opportunity to give them supplemental oxygen by an inhalation, mask, etc. That can be tried. We are quick, though, to place our patients on ventilators because of that danger that they may rapidly deteriorate. Mechanical ventilation after and de tracheal intubation is required in those patients. They can be repositioned for better ventilation. We have a number of patients in our Hospital today who are on ventilators and we are hoping that they will fully recover. So what are the major challenges that we face? Access to testing continues to be a problem, although we expect that to be sorted out within the next week or two. The strategy for testing versus quarantine has now been better elucidated by the City Health Department. We are not testing large numbers of the community. We are sending people home with precautions with guidance, the supply of masks right now in the City Hospital system. Both types of masks are in jeopardy. We have more of the surgical masks. The mess that are given to the patient than we have ABI n95 masks, but the city health system is the AJC, is looking really carefully at maximizing our supply of those flu season. Of course, as I said, it's coming to an end, the difficult thing is the last one projecting how bad this is going to get it's quite possible. It's very likely, first of all that we will see a massive surge in the number of cases over the next month. It's predicted that we will hit our peak in the first couple of weeks of May, and by that time we may find that many of our acute care hospitals like Elmhurst, are almost completely converted into intensive care units to manage these patients. We need the equipment and supplies to manage patients in those circumstances, and HNH is fighting hard, they're very good at this at getting the equipment and supplies that we need, but we are trying by every measure. We know how to Institute to bring our curve down and not have it hit catastrophic levels, as I showed you in that chart. So what does the future hold? Antiviral treatment and vaccines have received a lot of attention. There are several different antiviral drugs that have some potential role in this hydroxychloroquine is a drug that we're using it's FDA approved for malaria and it's being given to about 45 patients at Elmhurst right now in an uncontrolled fashion, but a standardized dosing and we're following those patients carefully and then a number of other drugs. You see listed here, renessa vir, the fourth drug down, has received a lot of attention, and this is a drug that we may be utilizing soon as an investigational agent on an expanded access approach. And then you see some of the other drugs that have been considered for treatment of this I think one thing that we may have as an advantage in our country is. We could look at the experience in China where they did have a lot of treatment experience with hydroxychloroquine and we can make a decision whether there is enough data there to strongly support using it and I would also point out that using a drug like hydroxychloroquine, for which we do have a long experience, it's quite possible that we can successfully look at this for prevention and that's a protocol that we're interested in introducing here soon experimental treatment. I won't go over this over and over again there. The problem with rim death severe it looked very promising for Ebola, and it got a bad name because it didn't work for Ebola, look good in the test tube and it's looked good for birds and SARS. We just don't know whether it is going to be as effective as it looks in preclinical trials, but that doesn't mean that we won't try. It we've reached the point where we have nothing that we can offer except somewhat unproven treatments. These treatments I call unproven, but they are very likely to be at least somewhat effective for one example: hydroxychloroquine. There have been several studies that show that the virus is actually cleared from respiratory secretions after about six days in patients receiving that vaccine development. There's a lot of politics around this I can just summarize by saying there will not be an effective vaccine, that's widely available for at least a year and a half two years or variety of companies that are working on vaccines, but the way vaccines are marketed. They have to be proven to be effective, they have to be tested in small preclinical trials and then clinical trials and then comparative trials, and that takes a long time and I would just remind everybody that when there is a vaccine for this and it's considered safe and effective, we should all take it. Unlike the flu vaccine, where every year it is a struggle to get everybody who should take it to take it, but vaccine development is a reasonably slow process. Maybe there will be a sudden breakthrough, but I don't think we should be anticipating it. So what will the future bring? It's almost certain that there will be many additional cases in the United States and unfortunately, tragically many additional deaths. How many cases and how many deaths over how short a period of time is what we don't know right now, things will get worse before they get better. We have to be careful about confusing messages. I would encourage everybody here to look carefully at the websites that I'm going to show you in a minute for the w-h-o, the CDC and webinars, which is tracking this epidemic and not pay too much attention to other sites on the Internet. We have to be careful. One thing that we have now that they didn't have during that SARS outbreak. They didn't have the internet, and now we do- and we know all know the pitfalls of looking at the internet for opinions, sometimes very likely, but not certain further restrictions on travel into an outside of our country. These are coming out each day. Now, hospital crowding could reach a point of being insurmountable for us. We hope not hospital supply issues we think will be manageable, but we're not sure vaccine I've talked about and antiviral drugs. Probably sooner there will be data on these, so this is the list of websites for more information. The first one is the World Health Organization that can give you information on the global pandemic. Cdc has a wealth of information on what's happening in our country, state-by-state, how people should protect themselves, what guidance is being given for treatment, hospitalization, etc, and that bottom side I find very useful world? Ah meters, they update the global picture, it's very hurry up to date several times during the day, and if anybody is just interested in seeing what the pattern of this is worldwide, including in the United States I, would strongly encourage you to try that one so I'll stop there and thank you very much for your attention and if we have any time for questions, I'd be happy to try and answer in English means community board number three and we thank you for a wonderful presentation and I'm going to turn over. We have a number of questions that were posted in the chat area and Kevin Hughes. Will? What we're gonna do is we're going to take you off a presenter mode. We're going to dr. Macy folks may ask you to go back and forth in your presidency. Highlights okay, so Niraj you were the first one to ask a question so I'm going to turn it over to you. My question was some about the coronavirus. A lot of people keep saying that it is made it was made on the lab. Is it true I, don't think it is it's an interesting question and I've gotten it a lot. I think you know every time, there's a an outbreak of anything new. There are early suspicions that somehow it's a biological weapon that got away from somebody I, don't think it is first of all the way, it's being it's widely transmissible. If you were going to create a biological weapon, you would not make it that would one like this. That would target everybody, military general population, everybody, but more down-to-earth the way this virus has mutated. This is very similar to what was seen with SARS. It's a different type of mutation that was seen with coronavirus and we've had that. Listening with MERS and we've just become more familiar with the patterns in which this virus changes itself I. Don't think that this is a bioterrorism event. I think this is a jump from animals into Hugh because of the live animal slaughtering that was occurring in that market in Wuhan and around there, ultimately is a pattern we've seen with some other pathogens jumping from animals into humans and I. Don't think there's any reason to think this is anything other than that. Okay, thank you. Well, thank you now, barage. Can you mute your line? Please I will thank you and now Renetta. You had some questions that you wanted to ask I. Guess one of my first questions: what is the rate of patients that you're seeing currently at helmers Hospital and the age ranges yeah? The number of patients we're seeing is going up very quickly. We've seen confirmed cases I think about a hundred and thirty. He had asked me that question last week. It would have been just a handful currently in the hospital because of the problem in getting test results which is on the verge of being solved, but since they can take several days, we have both confirmed cases and people under investigation, the confirmed cases we have about 25 or 30 in the hospital right now. Some of them are waiting in the emergency department for beds. We have a much larger number than that of these people under investigation. So that's the pattern we're seeing so far. Now we do expect that will change quickly and we'll continue to see an upward trend for at least another month. I have a question: can you hear me? Yes, Kevin will be calling out what Kevin will be calling out each person's name? Yes, thank you. Lisa I'll give you I'll when I call your name. You can ask your question okay, but we haven't go an order of people. Okay, thanks all right, Thank, You Renetta! So now I'm gonna, unmute, lob song, you love song. Are you with us? Do you have a question? Yes, everyone! If you want to see who's talking on the top of your screen, you can select who view who's talking to see that person question is seems like fewer cases in Russia at this time. Why do you think, like they have less fuel cases in Russia and in the almost hospital kind of overwhelm or is ready to kind of co-op with the situation? Well, the situation in Russia is always a little difficult to interpret, and since we know we had a an AIDS project in Russia for ten years and they were very reluctant to report their AIDS statistics, so I'm in touch with Russian physicians in st. Petersburg. They are beginning to see an uptake in this there and I think we have to wait and see whether Russia is going to be spared I doubt that they will be spared, and what was your other question? The other question was the almost hospital. How are we doing we're fine right now? We have very good equipment and supplies right now for these patients. We have a lot of experts caring for them here when we get the rapid turnaround on testing. That will make things much more simple for us and, as this outbreak converts into a very large-scale outbreak nationally, we will see much more of attention much more attention over toward treatment of hospitalized patients, because there will be so many and away from community testing which has taken up a lot of our resources so far, so right now we're fine, obviously, all of us in New York City, very cognizant of how this could get much worse. Thank you. Thank you, love song, all right, Giavanna! You had some questions that you'd like to ask. Coronavirus is listed on the Lysol sanitizer right; okay, sorry, I'm, sorry yeah, we just say while you're asking your second question. Coronaviruses have been around for a long time. We've known been around for a long time, and the reason that they're listed on those sanitizers is that they're common causes of the cold. It's the new, aggressive, dangerous corona viruses that are that are novel and there are different subspecies and therefore individual reinfected. Well, if they've actually been infected, we don't know the answer if they are infected and recover and have an antibody response, it may be that they're immune, but if you're asking the question, can we be repeatedly exposed, even after we've been exposed? Of course, we can and I think right now in New York. One thing we have to keep in mind is: the outbreak is growing. There are lots of people in New York, undoubtedly right now who have it, who don't have any symptoms, and if we encounter one of those people and are in too close proximity, we can catch this and we can catch it, even though we were tested the day before. But you know answer your first question: if you have been infected with this and you have an adequate host response, we are hoping very hard and assuming that you will have immunity to further infection, if once you have been infected and that may be what happened in China. That may be why the outbreak there seemed to come down so quickly. Okay, now I'm gonna hand this over to Megan Rockwell Megan. Are you with us Megan? If you're there, you need that yeah, actually Megan had to step away for a second. This is her husband, the questions sure, okay, so for the first part of the core two-part question. First is: what do you make of the recent study that children are now having bad outcomes and to us? What are your suggested best Pat practices for going to the drugstore or the supermarket or deli? And three do we need to wipe down? If we get, you know, deliveries like box deliveries, food deliveries. What do we need to you know wipe down and sanitize I would be very cautious about anything, that's delivered, and if you can wipe it down, it doesn't have to be with Purell. It can be with soap and water. I would certainly do that at my house. We don't have a lot of deliveries. I would be really careful about getting food brought in anything. Like that, your question about children. The data from China seem to suggest that children were relatively spared from this, but what we've seen since then, both in Italy and in our country, is there has been a really significant on children. Now the younger the child, the more resistant to this they seem to be so very young children and infants, seem to not get as serious and infection as older children and adults, but the idea that children can't get this, unfortunately, is not turning out to be true and I've forgotten. The first part of your question: just what are your suggested best practices for going in the drugstore or the supermarket or the Delta or any to get? You know to pick to god-sized to stores, if neither we think the best advice. You know that I have heard on this is to pretend that you have the infection, and that will remind you to stay away from other people to not be within three feet at all, certainly and best not be within six feet. If you have to go to the drugstore, obviously that's something that sometimes can't be avoided and you have to go to the food store. Just try your best to maintain those distances. That's really what you can do right now and I think you know if you do, that sort of thing, if you cover your cough cover your sneeze. If you wash your hands faithfully several times each day, maybe many times each day, just being really cognizant as often would or not of all the different things you touch during the day, soap and water, if you have access to a sink and soap, that's the best way to wash. If you don't, then these alcohol-based hand rubs if they have more than 70% alcohol like Purell seem to be effective. But you know these are simple pieces of advice that we would give in any spreading infection really and we've probably all told our children, this sort of thing about washing their hands. Now we have to really do it and I think that's an important part of lowering our curve in this country. All right and that's about all you can do as an individual. But please do it all right, hello. Everyone is everyone. There, yeah hi, everyone, I'm, sorry I, know, there's a lot. You all have a lot more health care and kind of the medical and science related questions, so I just want to pop in and let you all know just give you a quick update. We've been in constant communication with the heads of every hospital in our in our congressional district. That means East Elmhurst New, York Presbyterian. We also have been in touch with on the Bronx side, Montefiore Jacobi, Medical, Center, and more and really, but we're starting to see a little bit is that and on the Bronx half of the district. We are seeing some rising cases, but really we're starting to see that surge a little bit more in Queens, and so we are all trying to mobilize in making sure that every hospital is trying to coordinate and support each other as much as possible for those of you who not have seen or heard yet. Governor Cuomo and we've been working with Governor Cuomo to make sure that we roll out a moratorium on all mortgage payments for the next 90 days. So if you have been impacted by the virus and financially and are not able to make your mortgage payment in the next 90 days, there is an exemption and there is a suspension and moratorium for your mortgage payment made for you now. The next step that I'm, really starting to fight for, is to make sure that also applies to renters as well and, as most of us know, about. Two-Thirds of the city also constitutes renters. I. Think that if we're gonna give folks with mortgages a break, we need to make sure that we're giving folks with rent that our renters, including myself, I, don't need. Of course you know, I am a renter and so I think it's really important that we get everyone the help that they need, that no one gets displaced by this crisis. On the federal level there was limited paid leave that was put. We need to now push so that it's Universal paid leave, and you know from our district and our community I'm, keeping an extra eye out and really making sure that we're pushing policies for hourly workers, gig workers, contract workers and freelancers, because those are the folks that tend to get left out sometimes or the policy isn't written in the best way to include their needs as well. So right now our focus is of making sure that every worker and every person gets that we are expanding unemployment insurance. As many of you know, the seven-day waiting period has been waived, so you can apply for unemployment. The moment that you experience any sort of disruption to your income and yeah, and we will be continue to push in making sure that we're also expanding Social, Security, Medicare and Medicaid as well. So these are all things that are top of mind for us right now. If there are any questions and that you all have from a policy response, I'm happy to field them and we also have Noreen who's on my who's on the call as well, and if you have any additional questions, please feel free to call my office with any other questions that you may not think of tonight. We do have some questions from board members, so I'm going to unmute fausto Rodriguez. We all know that there is a pandemic. We're getting some interference. I'm just trying to figure out is so that I can use their line. Okay, I'm muting him right now. Okay, now we have a pandemic. The state the nation is in the states of emergency. Finding so weird is that we have a whole bunch of radio stations, TV channels, you know making the people crazy. I, you see he's making the people seeker to control that well, I. Think the one thing that's really important, and at least what I try to do every time I go on TV every time I go on the radio is that I tell people now is not the time to panic. Now is the time to prepare. So it's about prepare, don't panic, there's, no reason that you should have to panic. In fact, panicking can make things worse, because when everyone is so on edge, you know, of course this thing is hitting during seasonal allergy season. So now, anytime, anyone has a cough or feels you know a little stuffed and we all kind of are looking around and get a little scared and so I think it's really important that we reiterate that it's not a time to panic and in fact again it can make it worse, because if you are sniffling or have a cough and run to the hospital at very mild symptoms, we're gonna make the situation worse for everybody, because we need to free up the hospitals for the doctors and nurses and health care providers so that they can treat people that are in critical condition. So I think it's really important. Make sure that we're calm if you are experiencing any sort of symptoms, monitor them. So if they are relatively mild, just wait a little bit and see it could be a cold. It could be allergies and call your doctor if you feel like they are getting worse. Remember. The symptoms are dry, cough, their fever and body aches. Those are some of the most common symptoms. If you're feeling that and you think it's getting bad call your doctor and they can get you to a place to get the care that you need, but the safest place that you can be is your home so make sure- and you know I, we all try to do our part. I'm doing my part in that every time I go in for an interview, I say: prepare, don't panic! That means have enough food in your house. It means sanitize, your doorknobs and your light switches, but there's no need the panic is not a productive emotion, even if you need help because it'll freeze you up. Thank you, okay, thank you. Fausto now, I believe we're knob arash Casey. You had a question. Yes, sir I have a question to you: Oh see about since I'm a businessman and about the run, our restaurant. It's a bar on racism, right of the Jackson high and technically it's a closed mm-hmm. So in terms of the rent, no matter what we have to pay to the landlord there anything you are thinking about the rent for the business owner. That's been closed. According to the state law, yes, and so, as I said earlier, I, what we're pushing for it so, first and foremost, mortgages have now been suspended in the state. Now we're pushing to make sure that rent is also suspended. The state for the next 90 days, the governor, has called for the more has enacted the moratorium on mortgages, but has not yet enacted the moratorium on rent. But what that does mean of what I recommend to you is to talk to your landlord. If you are experiencing a read issue, talk to your landlord and say you know, the state has issued a 90-day moratorium on mortgages, so the landlord can't tell you know right now. A landlord can't tell you need to pay me rent, because I need to pay the bank, because right now, landlords don't have to pay the bank so talk to your landlord and ask them ask him if there's something that you all can work out. If you want to know the details of it, so the details on the mortgage suspension is that it's not that every mortgage payment gets suspended immediately. If you like, we can forward the Community Board, the actual we can for the Community Board information on the moratorium, but basically it's need-based, and so you are in need right now the restaurants have been closed in the city, and so that you know, I would presume also means that your landlord would also be in need because he would lose a tenant, otherwise, so I'm definitely look into it, but there is a provision made and if your landlord, if your landlord is getting a moratorium, then you should talk to them and ask them for a moratorium as well all right. Thank you all right. Thank you. Never osh! Now we're gonna I'm gonna unmute Nuala, Oh Doherty, who has a question you like you're up. You have to unmute your line, though Nuala hi congresswoman I wanted to talk to you about the vulnerable and those who are sheltered at home. How can we ask utilize, the Postal, Service I think they know who the people are, who are elderly or not leaving their homes. We might need well have a way that we can work with the Postal Service to find out who these people are and give them local people who might be able to help them mm-hmm. That's an excellent idea, one of the things that we did a training on tonight. We held a training on how to create a mutual aid network. So this is something that every single person tuning in to the call we can send you all the link to our training on it and the resource guide. So right now you know federally and legislatively we've introduced bills on things like postal banking and expanding essential services for the post office, but in the meantime there are things we can do a meaty immediately in our community and I think bringing in your local postal worker as part of your mutual aid network. You know so much of this change also starts from the bottom up as much as the policy work and the coordination that we're doing from the top down. I cannot tell you how important you Nuala, and everyone in this call is in making sure that we get we start building. Like a real on-the-ground understanding of our communities, so if you are listening right now- and you want to make sure that people in your community are taken care of talk to your postal worker and just ask them say: hey is there anyone that you know of that? I should check up on I'm on my block and I think we'll start there, but of course we're trying to get postal workers the protection that they need right now, because they are all also kind of frontline vulnerable workers as well. Thank you. Okay, Thank You Nuala, the next one up is lovesong salaka. You have a question. Yes, yeah. Give me one sec: okay! Yes! So while we wait for you there, yes, I am here, okay, ask your question: don't call us or mail. This is love sign again: I love, Sam, I'm, talking about the war driver and taxi drivers at the amount like an employee and I'm, not even like a small business. So I don't know what kind of assistance are available to them because they are the most hard-working people and there's a tens of thousand of them in your district. Yes, the other thing, the federal assistance y'all talk about just says about the just for citizens. So not true. That was just US citizens. Or can you qualify a little bit about what the Senate is talking about? Yes, absolutely so so one of the things- and this is kind of what I was also I- alluded to this earlier in that I'm, trying to make sure that all of our federal policy also includes gig workers hourly contract workers, because this is where they put in all of these loopholes where they say: oh, we'll, expand unemployment, insurance or right now, for example, the state has paid leave for all workers, but it requires you to be an employer and, more and more recently, a lot of these big companies, whether it's uber or whether it's you know shipped or GrubHub. They aren't calling their drivers, employees and they're almost like independent contractors. As you know, and so it's that's why the bill right now, that's being debated in the house in the Senate- has to do with universal basic income, so we're trying to get cash assistance to everybody, no matter what you do, who you work for or what your status is. So that's something so if you essentially I believe and what we're fighting for it is shape it's coming together. So the package has not been finalized yet, but we are trying to make sure that we get cash assistance to workers, and that includes uber drivers. Now, one thing that I can say is that, if, for whatever reason and you haven't been able to work, I would again encourage folks to look at the unemployment insurance policies and to file. If you are eligible- and you know, I- think it's really important that everyone starts getting the help and applying for the help as quickly as they can. Okay. Thank you. Love song, all right. This is a quick question from bill me and regarding undocumented workers, and we were just talking about taxi drivers and drivers. Anything specific you want to mention about undocumented New. Yorkers yeah, so it's an excellent question so, first and foremost, and we have secured a commitment from the administration that the public charge rule will be waived for undocumented members of our community. So you do not have to worry that you know if you are exhibiting symptoms and you go to the hospital and you use Medicare or Medicaid, you will not be subject to the public charge rule that is, scaring people out of going to school and applying for assistance, and things like that, you will. You will be exempted from that, so I'm, our undocumented neighbors. We have been able to waive the public charge rules so that they will not be and they will not be exposed to that, and so do please get the health care that you need if you are exhibiting symptoms of coping 19. So that's one thing: the other thing that we're looking at too when it comes to when it comes to universal basic income, that I think we can flag. Is you know who gets those checks? You know the ideas is that it's everyone so we're hoping that it's everyone with it's within with a AIT, that's or a tax identification number, and so we're again that legislation is still being drafted, it's in flux, but that's what we're that's the perspective that were championing. Okay. Thank you. We have a few more questions. If your question has already been asked and I call your name, please just defer to the next questioner, because we, the congresswoman's time, is very valuable as well as we have other speakers that are still on that the doctor that still is I'm finishing his QA as well as other speakers tonight, so we're just going to race through these real, quick mmm. Are you there to ask your question mm, so you have to unmute, okay, we're gonna move on to Marjorie. Let me find you Marjorie Clark, yes, I'm here hi. How are you my question was about the use of SNAP benefits. Then feds were saying that they were going to limit that by now in this situation, what's gonna happen to people who need and need to file for snap? Yes, so I'm so thankful that you asked that question the House bill that we just passed. The second emergency package should now expand snap. You are correct in that the Trump administration was trying to kick about 700,000 people off of snap, and you know the fact that this cry. First of all, it was wrong in the first place, but the fact that this is happening with so many more people are in need is very wrong. So what we've been doing is that at the latest package that we just passed expands snap and WIC, and it really makes sure that we are expanding food assistance for everybody, so that should be going into effect about immediately. We are still fighting that other rule and the other rule change that the administration is trying to go for, but I do believe that will be successful in pausing you, okay and one last question from Laverne: Nimmons Laverne! Sorry, can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you burn okay, hi OC, so glad that you're here and with us your presence, it's very much appreciated. Thank you. Little thing be extended to everyone, and what will that look like? Because you have people walking around? They don't know, what's gone on, whether they have it or not, they're afraid to visit families. I have family members calling me saying: don't come by April. This is woven, everyone needs to be tested, so you're a hundred percent right. We need to get mass testing out. We needed to get it out yesterday. We needed to get it out last week and we are working really hard on scaling up mass testing. The question you know. Frankly, a lot of this comes down to trump and we have had other countries offer us tests. We've had other you would. You know: we've had the World Health Organization offer testing protocols, and so what happened was that the Trump administration did not take up those offers early enough and they said we can produce these tests here and frankly, we can't not fast enough not what we needed them. So, as a consequence nationally, we have not had enough tests and that now that's resulted in what you're, seeing in that kind of wealthy and powerful people seem to be able to access a test like if you're, a sports star. You can get a test and you know a day, but if you're an everyday person. Oh sorry, if you're in, if you're in sorry about that, if you're an everyday person that's needed, help it it's been slow on the uptake. The good news, so first of all, Trump has kind of left the governors of every state to be on their own. The good news is that New York State. We are really working hard to ramp up the testing in the state and we are testing more and more people every day, and so the good news is that the numbers are starting to really tick up on the tests right now in the state of New York and we're working with our neighbors with new jury, Pennsylvania Connecticut and making sure that everyone around us is getting their testing up soon. But we don't have an immediate timeline of when you know we can get to the level of South Korea, where, if you need a test, you can get it immediately. I don't want to give you a false timeline, but what I can say is that we're starting to ramp up the tests more and more every single day and we are setting up a testing and a treatment tent in Elmhurst Hospital that went up today right now, it's by appointment only, but we are working to get to the point where you can just you know, show up and get tested. So you know it's starting to get up, but you're right. The goal is mass testing. We started. Ten steps behind a lot of other countries did because we rejected a lot of testing protocols from other countries and from the World Health Organization. Not we rather, the administration did and so we're trying to work through that challenge on a state level. So once the tests are available, do you have a plan of how you're going to get them to the people? Drug stores, like they have testing for the flu now or shots for the flu and all of the drug stores, are there normal units being set up, whether so we have so? What we have done in the house is that we have passed a provision saying that if you can get it once the tests are available, they will be free, so no one will be able and no one will not have to take a test because they can't afford it. So when these tests are available, they will be free to you right now. They're gonna, roll out in a level that in which, like first they'll, be able to be administered from a health professional, so a nurse or a doctor or another healthcare or a physician's assistant, would have to administer the test to you right now. There are some preliminary. You know at home tests that are being kind of tested out on you know. Hopefully we can get to a point where you can test yourself in your home, but right now it looks like the path is going to be. If you're experiencing symptoms. You call your doctor, you show up and you get tested and that test will be for free. Thank you. You're welcome, okay, Renetta I'm, throwing it back to you all right. Thank you! So much congresswoman. We really appreciate you taking the time to speak. The Queen's community board number three. As you know, we are really in a state of emergency right here and we really appreciate you bringing your knowledge and the information. Of course absolutely. Thank you all so much and stay organized and stay safe. Everybody. Thank you. Thank you. We have one another speaker is our Queens borough president and we're trying to figure out which line she's on which line are you on for president Lee? Are you on capacity cut service so that you can call upon each other Kevin? Yes, I'm here, I'm looking for her I can't seem to find her under her name, but I don't see her there anymore I saw her listed as Sharon Lee, but I don't see her listed anymore. Well, we're gonna text her okay, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna, ask the doctor to come back so that we can continue questions for the doctor. While we figure out where Miss Lee is yeah, I was trying to see who are still sure. Does everyone see this year's screen I was trying to get rid of it, so we could bring them to the doctor. I still have it I have it still I was trying to remove it from there. So but doctor does anyone P. Please ask the rest of the questions for the doctor. Okay, so I'm Edmund, you had a question. Well, the question was so there are any plans to set up a mobile testing site anywhere within Jack's, noisy Stauffers, both groan yeah. Can you hear me yeah good I, think on the on the tech, I, don't know of any plan to do that, I think the testing site that we have at Elmhurst. It's meant to be used. You know within some reasonable limits. I think it's very important that if you have no symptoms of this coming to be tested to any site like that is going to potentially put you on a long line where you would be exposed to the public and if you were testing negative, keep in mind. That does not mean that you will be negative next week, I think as we roll out testing, it really should be concentrated on people who have at least mild symptoms or a known contact with a case and I. Think as testing gets rolled out more and more I think we're gonna find that probably the majority of New Yorkers have actually been infected already and whether that's going to amount to immunity, we're not going to know that yet III, don't think testing if you're feeling well really makes much sense, either medically or logistically right now, all right, you have another question Kevin, the next one is Laverne and Kevin. If someone already asked the question on the list, can you choose a different person? Just in case I, know liver and ask the question to the congresswoman right: yeah I'm, sorry, sometimes the questions don't come through. They just say they have questions. So it's hard for me to screen I'm, also just trying to keep track. How long do you think this mass quarantine, although isolation of people generally, is going to take place? What's your thinking on that doctor, because this is really this is this- is out of out of control? I know, yeah I. Think, though, we have to keep in mind that the whole outbreak is very likely to get worse for at least another month now what that's going to mean in terms of advice to home, quarantine, etc. I think we have to recognize we're in a very unique situation. Right now, we've never been in a situation like that. Like this in my lifetime or I, don't think in anybody's a lifetime. You have a contagious disease that has a high mortality rate for which we have no vaccine and no treatment. We know it's transmitted from person to person and I think the measures that are being taken, as I mentioned earlier, to close stadiums, etc. I think those are very important, but I don't think we can yet say when quarantining will no longer be necessary. I think you have to keep in mind, there's a difference between quarantine. What that means is you're not known to be infected and you're staying away from other people and isolation, which means you're known to be infected and you're told to stay in your home right now. They have not really. They have not exercised any kind of lockdown in New, York, City or New York State, but I think we just have to keep in mind that this is a very unusual and very serious problem that we're facing, and if you look at what's going on in Italy and now in other countries in Western Europe, we don't want to see that here we're in entire country is now on lockdown. You don't want to see that so I think right now, let's do what we can do. Keep our distances. Maintain reasonable cleanliness, make note of symptoms. If we develop them, but right now, I, don't think it's possible to say that we're going to be ending these measures anytime in the next week or two- it's just not possible right now and I, don't think it's at all likely that we will be so then it's not likely that school openings like a long island is supposed to begin on March 30th, so that's not likely to happen. I think you know I'm not responsible for the schools. Thank God, but I think that's a pretty ambitious goal. I think. Maybe what a lot of organizations are doing is taking a wait-and-see attitude and seeing if over the next two weeks are over the next one month, things get worse like people are predicting or if they don't get worse and then maybe a change in the decision could be made. I think that's. Why you're hearing these limited timeframes, like two weeks three weeks a month, I'd be surprised if we're ready to open schools anywhere in two weeks, if those schools are currently closed because the epidemic is going to continue to spread and I think the role of children in this we talked about children a little earlier, and it is clear that at least older children have gotten infected, but what's of great concern with the schools- and this is true during flu season as well- is that children may not have symptoms and may be transmitting the infection among themselves and then bringing it home. So these are all complicated strategies. I think it's quite amazing what the government has done already, but I wouldn't be surprised if it continues longer than the next couple of weeks. Thank you. Thank you doctor. Thank you. I'm gonna foster Rodriguez. You had a question doctor what about during the first three to seven days, if I, if I had some symptoms, is there anything that I could go to the pharmacy and get to ameliorate the symptoms? Well, no I! Think! If you have fever, it's, it seems like it's safe to take Tylenol, we're not sure that it's safe to take bill and that sort of drug, but it probably is so you would do what you would normally do for those types of symptoms just to relieve the symptoms. There's nothing! You can go to the drugstore to get that would stop the infection just like there's nothing that would stop influenza. If you had symptoms of that, you would go take medicines to relieve the symptoms, so I think that's the situation we're in with this now. You know: there's a lot of interest and emphasis right now on trying to identify medications. I showed you a list earlier that we're going to be looking at that maybe would be helpful to actually stop this viral infection, but we're not there yet. Okay. Thank you! Faster I'm, gonna, move on to Liddy's la Perez. Liddy's la! Are you there? Yes, I am yes. Ah he did answer my question that you wanna add it, but I didn't want the same way. All that did they answer, and my question was: if you get immune to the virus, once you get it and you get cured, would you get immune and my second part of the question was more food slick likely for the congresswoman, but you've been talking about it, but every gathering has been canceled like in stadiums any place that gathered a lot of people is, being you know, top being close, but they don't say nothing about churches and I'm, unconcerned about those small churches. They Pentecostal Church, there's a lot of Pentecostal church, all over New York City, where they gather 40, 50 people and nobody has say anything about it. I'm sure, they're, gonna get together and concern me because the more people get sick, the more chances you got to become sick by then to by getting you know close to them, which I tried to stay away, but is heart, you're, absolutely right, I! Think the st. Patrick's Cathedral I think they announced this week is not going to be having mass and I think we're gonna see that sort of strategy sweep through the religious communities I think right now the state is recommending that groups any bigger than 10 or 15 people are dangerous. So it's hard to imagine that congregations are going to still be meeting as I said. As you might imagine, I don't have any control over that, but common sense would tell you do not go to gatherings like that, because you're absolutely right. That could be a great fuel for this whole epidemic. Okay, thank you. Isla I'm gonna throw this over to Philip Papas. Are you there Phil? Yes, I am. Can you hear me yes, go ahead and ask your question hi thanks so much mom, so my wife and myself and a lot of people I know obviously are working from home this week and for the foreseeable future. So far, so good, we're happy to have the technology be able to do that and happy to stay in place, but we're also going a little stir-crazy. So people are joking about it. Online, our gyms have been closed and our memberships frozen so just to sort of combat the stir-crazy and try to stay healthy. You know we're not having symptoms whatever. My question was: how safe is it if we have access, let's say to a really open, empty block? There's no pedestrians to just go for a walk or go for a jog if we're not really going to encounter other people. That is absolutely safe and I would encourage that. You know I, think my wife, who's, retired and is stuck at home, is having those same questions and she likes to walk. She likes to run and she's getting out and doing it. I think you're right if you're in an area where you can stay six feet, at least from it, everybody else and that's easy to do in many areas. Absolutely you should get out of the house luckily about the only good thing about all this. Is it didn't happen in the middle of winter, the ten feet of snow? It happens now as the temperature is getting warmer and it's going to be easier to get outside. So I think that is totally appropriate and I would encourage that kind of thing. Okay, thanks Phil thanks Phil I'm gonna, throw it to Chanelle Thomas Henry. How are you there shanell you have to unmute shanell? Are you there? Okay, thanks, yes, I am I was I. Think you need me yeah Jamie. Yes, we can hear you go ahead. Ask your question! So it's a two-parter when patients come to the hospital. What's the procedure in terms of contact or they are you guys, or the Department of Health, still contacting individuals that they may have come in contact with to put them on any type of quarantine? Well, if a person comes and they have been shown to have this virus, the Department of Health is then responsible for contacting their contacts, their households, etc. As more and more people are identified as having the infection, that's going to become a more and more difficult process, but that's why we have a Public, Health, Department I think we have to be careful not to assume hospitals can do more than they're going to be doing anyway, just taking care of their very sick. But yes, I think. All of us, though, have to recognize how large a problem this is in a city, this big, and we have to do our best to understand what's going on around us and to help in identifying people who we think might have been exposed. But I do think that what we're going to find in the next couple of weeks is that the as the number of very sick people, rapidly Rises and hospitals are increasingly busy taking care of them that the entire issue of testing will have to be on the back burner somewhat. If you have symptoms and you need to be evaluated for those symptoms, particularly if you have shortness of breath, that is something that you should be seen for. But if you have cold symptoms, I think, even if it is Co vid 19, most people who have this recover from it nicely you're, better off, staying home, staying away from other people and not exposing other people, but we live in New York. There are people who may have five roommates there, people who have no roommates there, people who have young children in the house, people who are living with pregnant women. There are all kinds of scenarios and we really do too on our Public Health Service in New York City in New York State to really help the hospitals with that contact. Tracing I mean for those individuals who are hospitalized. Are they able to still be in contact or visited by their family, or do they themselves become quarantine and isolate it? No in the city hospital system, they've created a strict quarantine process for adults for infants. There may be some flexibility in that. Obviously, that's really important for infants, but for adult patients you should not visit. You should not expect it to be visited if you're a patient in the hospital- and that is all to protect the public from getting infected, if not by the person you're visiting, then by simply being in a Anna ward, where there may be other patients who are able to spread this infection. So that's a policy. It's part of the social distancing strategy that I think will ultimately be extremely important in New York and in the United States to keep us apart, and it's not always nice to not have visitors when you're in the hospital. But it's a sacrifice, we're all gonna have to make Thank You Chanel all right, I'm gonna, throw it to Richard Mullings, which I believe is one of the last few questions we got going here. Okay, Richard, are you there? Yes, I'm here, okay, go ahead, Richard British great! Thank you. Doug for the presentation. I have a question about the viruses staying in certain surfaces so far, I heard that on plastic and on stainless steel it could stay up to three days in the air. It could be about three hours. He talked a little bit about the precautions we should take yeah. Are they staying singing yeah? Obviously in the hospital? This is of great concern and it does seem like the virus can remain viable on offices for several hours, so on cleaning of surfaces is extremely important. It doesn't have to be with any fancy cleaner. It isn't in the hospital and doesn't have to be at home in terms of how long it lingers in the air I think there are several different studies looking at this and they estimate very different lengths of time for it to be in the air. Some it's as few as a few seconds. That's why it's considered a droplet organism, but there are some studies that suggest it can be aerosolized somewhat longer, I think, though, when it gets aerosolized, so it lingers in the air for more than just a couple of minutes, that's not likely to be simply from someone coughing, it's from someone being suctioned in the hospital or being on a ventilator where they have to open the poor, and you know the port rather and suction, right out of the tube I. Don't think it's going to be aerosolized in the air like that in a household I, don't but surfaces, we really have to be very cognizant of and careful about, they have to be cleaned. Okay, so thank you. Doctors I do well Renetta, wanted me to open the floor to some of the callers, the people that were calling in so I'm gonna, which okay, so caller one I'm gonna unmute some of the callers here. If you have questions, please ask them now: Mathi, okay, hello, yeah. My question to dr. Matthew go mr. joy Julian. My question to him is: has this hospital put into any supply from the Army Corps of Engineers such as these ventilators and mask the things that they need? Yes, through the H and H central office, they are contracting with the Army Corps of Engineers and with other resources outside of our immediate area. The city hospital system in New, York and I've worked with them on other outbreaks like this. They are extremely aggressive and very good at getting the equipment they need. So if it's about well, they will get it. The concern is, will it be available to the manufacturers have to pick up the pace right now? It is available for the for the next few weeks. We have plenty of it after that. I have great faith in the city hospital system to get whatever we can get. Questions on question number two I would like to also ask if there's a need for your hospitals to have one of those treatments that are set up, that they do. Would that be possible? To put it I mean your location? Where would you put it yeah? We, you know we're working on several strategies to provide testing so that people wouldn't have to come through the emergency department course. We've set up a small by appointment clinic for testing. That would be. You would be referred to if you called. There is also a limited capacity to handle. People who walk in I would really emphasize the point, though, to come to be tested. If you're not feeling sick is liable to be a complete waste of time and could expose you to people who do have the virus. So please, before you seek testing, be sure that you have a reason to you've been exposed to someone who is known to have it, for example, or getting symptoms that go beyond simple cold symptoms. We don't want to overload the testing capacity, it's been delicate to begin with, it'll expand eventually, but, as I said a little while ago, I think a couple of weeks from now we're going to be soaked and absolutely consumed with taking care of people who actually are sick. With this that the capacity for hospitals to offer testing is not going to just expand and expand and expand. Don't be careful, I think you can get advice by going online, you can look at the CDC website. They have information on this. The state the city health department has, should you actually be tested and I would refer you to those websites and I've listed a couple of them at the end of my lecture, Thank You Reverend Peter heron get in that the employee population Savion the guarantee cause of have you seen any patients arm or what is done for the homeless shelters or for those people who are home on the streets. Have you seen any patients in that those categories we have and I think this is obviously a major concern. There are many homeless people in New, York City, and they obviously cannot be sent back out to the street if they have if they are sick- and we don't do that, but we are looking into I know. The city hospital system is looking into potential expansion of housing services for people in that condition. Obviously, it's never a good thing to have thousands of people who are homeless, as we do right now. So it is a struggle right now and I can't pretend we have the ultimate answer to it, but it is something we're very aware of and it's something we have a lot of experience with, and the public hospitals in general and certainly specifically at Elmer's. Thank you one more question from the callers. Anyone. Alright, then, thank you, Kevin. Alright, thank you so much dr. Massey. Thank you for a wonderful presentation. Answering our questions. We will send out the presentation to the board members any member any one for the public. If they're interested, we will also okay, we'll post it on Twitter, Facebook and our website and on our website to presentation. Thank you, dr. Massey, Thank You, mr. Rocha Thank, You, attea, Butler, Thank, You, Ellmers hospital and all you do for our community here. Thank you for inviting us and me to give this presentation and for the very good questions we will keep you updated as we can't thank you again Renetta before we move on. Thank you doctor, but bernetta before we move on Jessica from the mayor's Community Affairs Unit wanted just to mention something in regard to what the doctor was talking about. Jessica are you there and jessica has been wonderful. Providing us would have a lot of information and we have to thank her for a hard work. She's working, 24/7 I think she may have I'm gonna end I'm gonna end she's still there. So while we wait for her Zecharia Boyer from the public advocate's office also had a comment that he wanted to make in regard to the doctors. Presentation. Zach are you there? Can you unmute your line? I think I think I'm unmuted now. Can you hear me all right, Kevin? Yes, we can hear you hi everybody. Thank you for having me on. This has been really great and thank you very much to Elmhurst Hospital for doing such a fabulous job, keeping us safe and thank you, dr. Massey, for saying everything just very quickly. The only thing I wanted to add is that our office is currently working on a hotline and more details will be coming. Those who are unable to leave their homes. We will be sending out information from the public advocate's office on our social medias, so that people can know when they can call in and which number to call for different religions. Things like that, but that information will be coming slowly as of right now. I do not have a number to give I just wanted to say hello, I'm gonna, make sure I get my information to any board members. I'm gonna try to give you such information as I can, from my end and just real quickly, I saw a question who's speaking. My name is Zechariah Boyer from the public advocate's office. I'll put my email and number in the chat for people problem. Jessica are you? Are you there? Yes, I am the earlier question about religious services. The mayor's office has been coordinating and communicating with faith leaders about religious service, with the restrictions that have come on the federal level, as well as the state level. Both the Archdiocese of New York and the Diocese of Brooklyn have canceled all masses, and so, at this time services are not being held, but religious institutions are open for individuals to come inside and pray all right. Thank you really, of course, Thank You Jessica.

If you do not have a question, please don't say anything: okay, there are there any questions walk around yet: okay, I'm gonna, mute everyone. Okay, see! Do you have any comments hold on I have to UM I have to put Steve back on just give me one. Second, all right Steve should be unmuted now. Do you have any comments? Okay, let's move on all right, so open up the meeting by doing the Pledge of Allegiance. This we're going it's executive session, a little black to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under God undeniable, with the liveries unjust and for all I'm motion to adopt you. Today's agenda, everyone can't okay, everyone's unmuted. Second I make the motion repeater on do admin.

Full this advocated by a decision has to be signed, stating they'll Alice corroboration will be 24 hours daily out long be served from 12 p.m. to 4 a.m. Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 a.m. on Sunday is to facilitate Sunday brunch and last call will be 3 a.m. daily to allow for beverages to be consumed by at 4 a.m. stipulation has been signed every received.

If you have something to say then unmute on your end, so that you can ask your question that way. We don't have all of the feedback from everybody's lines, so we'll do it from both ends. Okay, so if you, if you can ever if everyone can just mute on your own lines and only unmute, if you have something to add or ask or okay, so I'm going to unmute everyone [Applause] does anyone happen to copy I? Have a question. Okay, this said Wesley. We just met the Jackson Heights beautification group, with the captain, that's in charge or a half in charge from the one five of the Roosevelt task force if you're not I'm. Sorry, if you're not talking, please mute your line go ahead. Ask and we asked him one of the top priorities that he's concerned about in the neighborhood. The first thing he mentioned was a number of bars. Now we all know there well, we didn't know this for sure, but there are 240 bars within our community board and obviously many of them are on Roosevelt Avenue and that's why they have a task force. But he says over 240 there were only four bars that give them constant trouble, so he's being inventive, he's going to the Health Department and he's going to check their SLA authorization. If they say that a restaurant he makes sure that there's a chef on duty when they say they closed and, as you know, not vote on any bar restaurant that is open until 4:00 a.m. in the morning that that's not a restaurant, that's a bar and I know what that do. So that's what I wanted to say and I appreciate the time the corporate change all right. Anyone else has a question. You have a question related to this particular applicant. The corporate changed. Anyone else have a question regarding the corporate change. I guess I.

This is how we're going to use that's how we're going to meet for our regular meeting and for our committee meetings. So please stick close to your emails and through the mail and you'll get some information or you'll get a phone call from the office all right so again, as it's mandated by section 70 of the Charter. This is reason why you had to meet today and I'm happy. We were able to use this technology, as you can see from my report. It's a variety of things that we did last month and going forward. Things are definitely going to have to change, but I thank all of you for joining the call for participating. I wish you also stay healthy, keep in touch. You will be hearing for the Community Board three offices. If there's any changes, please let me know but again, thank you. Everyone. Thank you. Thank you for being on the line here today. If you have any questions for me, social distance, everybody, yes, social, distance, correct love, song social distance, all right so does anybody else have any questions. This is a Vern I. Don't have any questions about just like to thank you for this phenomenal event. It was really well done and then kudos to you and to all of us board members great job, everyone, great job, okay, good night, everybody. What do you mean that gun is done? We have I call for the motion for the minutes from February for approval I, all in favor artha. Can you unmute your line? I just unmuted Marta come on okay. So the only item for the parks department was. We had a meeting on Thursday February 27th. We talked about the Gorman playgrounds, it's a 4.6 million dollar project from councilmember Kosta continuities, its 30th Avenue between 84th and 85th Street. It's the play area. They went through adding some gates at 30th Avenue in the north entrance fencing around the playground planting the same footprint as the existing play area. It will drain properly. They'll have safety surfaces mats padding. Currently, there are no programs in the park. The building that is, there is used for maintenance. There are no pets in the park in the playground, specifically dogs, who's there. Mr. Giddings up, please unmute your line go on Marta. These are the other parts of the park may allow dogs, but they need to be on a leash, they're gonna, make sure, there's benches and game tables and some new lighting. We talked about a possible permit to use the park for a meeting that may come with a nominal fee and the park does close at nine o'clock, so we discussed it within the committee to support the project so that we, what we are seeking tonight is a letter of approval, so the project can go to the next steps in the process, which is procurement and design to choose the design firm. Once the parks department finishes, these documents in November of 2020, approximately construction would start in the fall of 2021, with the completion of one year, which would be in 2022, so I need a moat. I need a motion that for sending a letter of approval, if I could get a second bun that, and if everybody is in favor, they will send a little. This is Kevin I. Second, everyone is unmuted to do the so if everyone is in favor of sending the letter. Thank you very much. The other item that I just want to address is that, due to the situation we are living in currently flushing meadows-corona Park is closed in terms of all their programs. The museum, the Hall of Science, the skating rink, the owl order, Center everything is closed in the park. At this time. I have received emails from it's your parks and from parks around the city. Everything has stopped at this point. There everything was canceled from the April 26, Earth, Day or open park day to the event on April 24th, the tree pruning the pruning project on March 21st was cancelled as well. So all everything is on hold at this time due to the emergency at hand. If you do go out to walk in everything just practice, your social distancing try to stay active in whatever way possible and just stay safe, and we will hopefully have a committee meeting to discuss the World's Fair barriness coping 9 and we may be using this technology for that committee meeting and then we'll go on from there. Okay, so that meeting will be next week on the 26th and I believe. Is it it's at 7 o'clock and that information will go out so that we could have a committee meeting regarding the World's, Fair, marina and what they want to do there? A scoping meeting, I believe on March 5th, but we did ask them to come to us because we want to see what they're gonna do specifically and we'll go from there. So thank you and everybody stay safe. We hold on one second I'm gonna mute everyone, okay, Renetta your life, yes, I know: I, said this chair, that youth services planning committee and a number of our young people that are expecting to walk for graduation. A number of the ceremonies have been postponed. Please support those young people and tell them how wonderful they are and explain as much as you can. What we're going through with this emergency and hope and I know that things will get better, and this is going to be another chapter, but please I know a lot of the young people are concerned and quite upset that they're not able to walk in graduation and not be able to participate in their sports and so on and so forth. So please support those young people all right. Who's next I think that's the mystery okay good evening, everyone just one or two okay, I just wanted to. Thank you all for participating with tonight's meeting. We will be conducting our committee meetings and full board meetings in this sort of forum for the near future and, as we continue to do, to use this process, I'm sure that people will become very comfortable that in this forum, the other thing I wanted to wish those who have birthdays of them in the month of March. A happy birthday I know that Fausto Rodriguez do be in the dark, Jimmy Smith, Steve, Kohana, k--, stick won't know it's been or are celebrating their birthday. So I also wanted to wish you all a happy birthday. We will be in touch, as you know, because of the current medical crisis we have. A community board will not have anything to face meetings.

Everyone is working remotely, but if anyone wants to reach out, you can still reach out to me by email or by phone. I can write it in there. If you don't have it I know a bunch of you, I can say that we've done some predictions of what the cost of this outbreak. This koba 19 outbreak will be to the city where our office is thinking that, through the second quarter of the fiscal year, the next fiscal year, that the cost of the city will be about 3.2 billion in lost tax receipts lost tax revenue and the office is asking that some revisions be made to the budget. Some spending cuts for some non-essential services. That might be that could total about 1.4 build-in, and that would mean cuts to most city agencies. Aside from Department of Health, of course, we're also advocating for some things to be done to help small businesses things like employees. No, it's just some cuts to certain programming's things that we're spending could be lessened. I can send you the link. I can put it into the comment section there. If you want to read this press release, sorry email it to the board office. Okay, yeah, no problem I'll! Do that yeah! It's just so I'm saying that most of the agencies should cut the budget by about four percent, but it's not saying that people should lose their jobs. Okay and, like I, said we're advocating for a lot of things to happen to help small businesses things like making it, so they don't have to give their sales tax to the city of the next filing, which is this month. You know and various some forms of relief we're advocating for you can look up and down our main throwaways Northern Boulevard Astoria, Boulevard, 37th Avenue, so many bills.
