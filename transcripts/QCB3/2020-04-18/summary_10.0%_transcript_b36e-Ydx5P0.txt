To begin with, the roll call Kevin hold on Renata one second, when I unmute, only those that are going to be raising a question or saying you know here or voting or whatnot will unmute on their end to vote or raise their question or say I'm here and then mute themselves, so that we can reduce the amount of feedback That is where we will be asking people to pose their questions and I will be relaying all the questions from the chat box to the speakers, just in the essence of time and unmuting and muting We will then, following that we will have a session where we will open the floor to the callers and I won't be able to hear people when they say here.
and I know you have a big agenda, but I wanted to come on and just talk to you for a minute or two about some of the things we're seeing in this new world and I know that this community has been hit very hard by kovat and I know that the struggle for our small businesses for people who are burying their parents and their grandparents Two weeks ago, I lost my own mother that's what's bringing the whole city together, but I want you to know that part of the work that our office is doing is to bring about a real discussion about why some communities, mostly communities of color, are being hit extra hard by the virus.
The other is on committees of colour that have been impacted, so I'm going to try to use this office to think about ways to finally end this inequality, - I know you have a busy agenda, but I know you have the time, because we gave you if you would like to speak about anything else.
We don't give out money to watch the money, but that doesn't mean that we can't work with community-based organizations and partner with Jessica Ramos and Catalina Cruz congresswoman, Picasso, Cortez and James is representing me tonight at the board and if we can get your information, I can try to help The. Other thing, I think people should know is, in addition to medical issues.
We're going to ramp up the economy, I believe we need 500,000 tests at minimum in the city and massive increases in areas where people can go You know not to go by car and bus, but you should have a testing site eventually down the block.
Again, I, don't think we are where we have to be in the city or the state, and that is something we're all Are there going to be practice in New York, because I heard we have lost from our community 150 people and most of them are asking me one that those who have little symptom without a big s, er hassle, that can make public test.
Community has to know about who to contact what help is available to people, whether you're, immigrants or others battle the coronavirus, though James will make sure the committee board members get this and the elected officials I'm very sorry about your mother, my sympathies.
I've always believed mmunity is the local community boards you represent over 100,000 people and I know how important it is to get information to all of you.
A big bank now they've been struggling before Corona, and we want to make sure that your rapids, not the business, never get federal and local program I'm nonprofit contracts and to please continue the good work because nonprofit support our communities in so many ways.
The job is to he's not for profits running it all cost doctor shut them down because they're, the ones that are least likely to be able to open when we think about what we're going through-- and let me just say, I like to look at New, York City with the glass half full, but we're gonna have to be very careful and thoughtful about how we slowly turn on the economic spigot.
So I'm going to talk a lot more about this in the city, but I do think that the economy for people we care about really starts with our not-for-profits, all right, Thank, you so much for joining us and answering all the questions and again our sympathies to you and your family Much and I look forward to seeing all of you in person, I promise to come to the committee board and stay for hours, because I want to get out of the house and she's gonna talk about the impact of Kobe 19 on our mental health.
I am a clinical psychologist and I work at New, York Presbyterian Hospital at the wild Cornell campus I'm going to be talking about how we know Koba 19 is affecting everybody's mental health and this really crazy time that we're all going through I We do have some preliminary data from China about how mental health was affected there So far it's their outbreak started, as you know earlier than ours, and in one study of over a thousand respondents from many cities over half of people, rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe so said, This has been incredibly distressing for about 16% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms, meaning they were in a clinically significant major depressive episode and about a third reported moderate to severe anxiety, symptoms, This is much higher than normal rates of depression and anxiety in the community, and we also saw a small percentage.
That is so important and then 71 percent reported distress from the situation, so maybe not specifically to pressure insomnia, but they were just stressed, maybe experiencing anxiety or anger, or frustration about how everything was going with the coronavirus Now. We don't have as much data from New York, since this has been more recent here, but we do have some So definitely more people are reaching out to mental health services than would in the past, and the director of community engagement on Brown said that of the callers who talked about the coronavirus There's a lot of uncertainty that comes with the coronavirus, uncertainty about What's, going to happen with my job am I going to stay healthy, Is, my family, going to stay healthy, and so that can all cause a lot of anxiety?.
You care about Look for the good news stories that can give you some ideas about how to do that, such as I've seen lots of stories about people doing by parades for someone whose birthday it is things like that which is very heartwarming and nice to see limit your news, consumption Are things that you should be doing all the time to help your mental health.
Exercise has become more difficult because you can't go outside with being around a lot of people All. The gyms are closed, but find ways that we're lucky to have the internet find online exercise classes that you can do find ways that you can just do some jumping jacks with your kids or something like that anyway, that you can exercise at home is good and that's also going to help your sleep, avoid alcohol and drugs and eat healthy, well-balanced meals, whatever it is, the next one I think is really important, which is to normalize your feelings.
One of our Bangladesh community people were calling me His mother was going to be transported to Alma's hospital, but due to the bad experiences and too much hazard there, he wanted to shift his mother to Presbyterian right set my mother on call administrator for Queens general All right drive throughs now also to get my tests It would be helpful to you and still and others that we can definitely add on the community board side we're getting a lot of information from some of our representatives and we can share what we know in regards to testing and where people can go and so on and so forth.
