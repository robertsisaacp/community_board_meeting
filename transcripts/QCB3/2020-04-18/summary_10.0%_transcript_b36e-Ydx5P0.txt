And I know you have a big agenda, but I wanted to come on and just talk to you for a minute or two about some of the things we're seeing in this new world.
Two weeks, ago, I lost my own mother, there's terrible virus and there's very little closure, And I think that's what's bringing the whole city together, but I want you to know that part of the work that our office is doing is to bring about a real discussion about why some communities, mostly communities of color, are being hit extra hard by the virus, as opposed to other communities, and it really goes to the health disparities that have existed for many years.
You, know we're not just seeing 80 year olds in the hospital, but in the Bronx were seeing people who were 50 and 60 and they have type 2 diabetes and there's pre-existing conditions, and it starts at an early age with you, know: pollution plants and obesity issues and overcrowding in our communities.
The other is on committees of colour that have been impacted, so I'm going to try to use this office to think about ways to finally end this inequality.
We don't give out money to watch the money, but that doesn't mean that we can't work with community-based organizations and partner with Jessica Ramos and Catalina Cruz congresswoman, Picasso, Cortez and James is representing me tonight at the board and if we can get your information, I can try to help.
I think people should know is, in addition to medical issues.
Ma'am any, have you all started some kind of like secondary location for testing here and the community board 3 area?
You know if there's been anything any other opportunities for people in committee board three but four to get testing.
I, don't know specifically the location, so I have James check on that, but we I do think that the mayor's called for 50,000 tests is ridiculously low.
I believe we need 500,000 tests at minimum in the city and massive increases in areas where people can go.
Are there going to be practice in New York, because I heard we have lost from our community 150 people and most of them are asking me one :: Can we make tests because without symptom they cannot make tests, but can you do something That, those who have little symptom without a big s, er hassle, that can make public test possible?
Nobody knew really what she had and, but it was very you know, obviously older, with some health issues, but we also should be testing people for a system apps and symptomatic because you could become a carrier to the virus.
Community has to know about who to contact what help is available to people, whether you're, immigrants or others battle the coronavirus, though James will make sure the committee board members get this and the elected officials I'm, very sorry about your mother.
I've always believed mmunity is the local community boards you represent over 100,000 people, And I know how important it is to get information to all of you.
Marjorie Clark would like to know what them what the city is doing to streamline the paperwork, to access any of the support for small businesses like the ones who have less than ten people.
Today, record numbers of people came on to hear what we had to say: we're bringing in state federal local officials we're going to bring you know.
We have a family get this in 12 languages, so I am dead, serious to get small businesses, especially equipment Minari own businesses, the help they need because they don't have the Economic Security, meaning they don't got a big bank now they've been struggling before Corona and we want to make sure that your rapids, not the business, never get federal and local program.
All cost doctor shut them down because they're, the ones that are least likely to be able to open when we think about what we're going through-- and let me just say, I like to look at New, York City with the glass half full, but we're gonna have to be very careful and thoughtful about how we slowly turn on the economic spigot.
So I'm, going to talk a lot more about this in the city, but I do think that the economy for people we care about really starts with our not-for-profits all right.
I am a clinical psychologist and I work at New, York Presbyterian Hospital at the wild Cornell campus I'm going to be talking about how we know Koba 19 is affecting everybody's mental health and this really crazy time that we're all going through I We do have some preliminary data from China about how mental health was affected.
So far, it's their outbreak started, as you know earlier than ours, and in one study of over a thousand respondents from many cities over half of people, rated, the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe so said.
It's been running, so definitely more people are reaching out to mental health services than would in the past, and the director of community engagement on Brown said that of the callers who talked about the coronavirus.
So we already have a group of people in the city, obviously like anywhere, who have pre-existing depression or anxiety or other mental health problems, and those can be exacerbated at this time.
If we need to Besides, going to the people who are in power and saying we want to be able to be tested, I know that one good thing that's happening at new york-presbyterian is that they are working on making their own tests to really try to up the capacity of tests that they have, instead of waiting to get them from somewhere.
Side, we're getting a lot of information from some of our representatives and we can share what we know in regards to testing and where people can go and so on, and so forth.

Thank you so much for your support and I am available to provide any assistance so that that's We have been on a number of calls and we have been advocating for our area, because Ellmers hospital should not be an option for our neighborhood to go to as a testing site only or the only option.
Yes, the medical exam, the coroner's office, one of the things that I'm noticing in the community and other people have called me.
I also know that there were some articles that mentioned that a lot of people who live in our area actually work, probably in Manhattan, but in certain services, where they would have come into contact with a lot of people.
I, remember: I just saw the woman when I went to go, vote You know they didn't- have three conditions and they were all under 40 and that's another thing that they were saying that it's only Boulder this at all ages, even maybe even young people, so Sorry that the bang of the society is the largest Bangladesh organization like 28,000 member here, and all society passed away by the coroner And I started the second of the Bangladesh right now, because I was the senior basis then And I.
