And I know you have a big agenda, but I wanted to come on and just talk to you for a minute or two about some of the things we're seeing in this new world.
Two weeks, ago, I lost my own mother, there's terrible virus and there's very little closure, And I think that's what's bringing the whole city together, but I want you to know that part of the work that our office is doing is to bring about a real discussion about why some communities, mostly communities of color, are being hit extra hard by the virus, as opposed to other communities, and it really goes to the health disparities that have existed for many years.
You, know we're not just seeing 80 year olds in the hospital, but in the Bronx were seeing people who were 50 and 60 and they have type 2 diabetes and there's pre- existing conditions, and it starts at an early age with you, know: pollution plants and obesity issues and overcrowding in our communities.
The other is on committees of colour that have been impacted, so I'm going to try to use this office to think about ways to finally end this inequality.
I know you have a busy agenda , The conversation can go that way, so I'm, going to everyone.
We do not give out money to watch the money, but that does not mean that we can't work with community- based organizations and partner with Jessica Ramos and Catalina Cruz congresswoman, Picasso, Cortez and James is representing me tonight at the board and if we can get your information, I can try to help.
I think people should know is, in addition to medical issues.
Ma'am any, have you all started some kind of like secondary location for testing here and the community board 3 area?
You know if there's been anything any other opportunities for people in Committee, Board, three but four to get testing.
I do not know specifically the location, so I have James check on that, but we I do think that the mayor's called for 50,000 tests is ridiculously low.
I believe we need 500,000 tests at minimum in the city and massive increases in areas where people can go.
As, my understanding and that's the end going to be key to bringing people back into the community back into the job, market, first and foremost for the doctor.
I do not think we are where we have to be in the city or the state, and that is something we're all going to have to collectively ask questions about and push for: okay, Mr. Chowdhury!
Are there going to be practice in New York, because I heard we have lost from our community 150 people, and most of them are asking me one.
You know that in places in this criminal Ward district and in communes, the colorful people with different languages and different backgrounds, these are the communities that are being hurt, the most and yet the least amount of resources, testing and other engines are being given to the community I'm going to send the committee Board.
That's online about law community has to know about who to contact what help is available to people, whether you're, immigrants or others battle the coronavirus, though James will make sure the Committee board members get this, and the elected officials I'm going to partner with all your elected officials in the coming weeks.
I've always believed mmunity is the local community boards you represent over 100,000 people, And I know how important it is to get information to all of you.
Marjorie Clark would like to know what them what the city is doing to streamline the paperwork, to access any of the support for small businesses like the ones who have less than ten people.
Record numbers of people came on to hear what we had to say: we're bringing in state federal local officials we're going to bring you know.
We have a family get this in 12 languages, so I am dead, serious to get small businesses, especially equipment Minari own businesses, the help they need because they do not have the Economic Security, meaning they do not got a big bank now they've been struggling before Corona, and we want to make sure that your rapids, not the business, never get federal and local program.
All cost doctor shut them down because they're, the ones that are least likely to be able to open when we think about what we're going through-- and let me just say, I like to look at New, York City with the glass half full, but we're going to have to be very careful and thoughtful about how we slowly turn on the economic spigot.
So I'm, going to talk a lot more about this in the city, but I do think that the economy for people we care about really starts with our not- for- profits.
I am a clinical psychologist and I work at New, York Presbyterian Hospital at the wild Cornell campus I'm going to be talking about how we know Koba 19 is affecting everybody's mental health, and this really crazy time that we're all going through I We do have some preliminary data from China about how mental health was affected.
So far, it's their outbreak started, as you know earlier than ours, and in one study of over a thousand respondents from many cities over half of people, rated, the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe so said.
Definitely more people are reaching out to mental health services than would in the past, and the director of community engagement on Brown said that of the callers who talked about the coronavirus.
So we already have a group of people in the city, obviously like anywhere, who have pre- existing depression or anxiety or other mental health problems, and those can be exacerbated at this time.
That, such as I've seen lots of stories about people doing by parades for someone whose birthday it is things like that, which is very heartwarming and nice to see limit your news, consumption.
I know that there are a lot of unique concerns with that, come with parenting in this time and newer Presbyterian Hospital, the youth anxiety, Center, has put together a Webinar series about parenting strategies for challenging times and that's available to watch at anytime at the link that I've provided These are just my references and I'm going to leave up the resources slide for a minute so that people have it.
If we need to Besides, going to the people who are in power and saying we want to be able to be tested.
I know that one good thing that's happening at New, York- Presbyterian, is that they are working on making their own tests to really try to up the capacity of tests that they have, instead of waiting to get them from somewhere.
There might be a technical issue, so I'm going to unmute all on my end, I'm, pretty sure everybody's already unmuted on mine end, but If you have a question, please feel free to ask Dr. Hart what about the impact on health, providers?
Definitely, an impact that we're seeing on health providers we've set up at New, York emergency and a psychologist psychiatrist to every department in the hospital.
It would be helpful to you and still and others that we can definitely add on the community board side, we're getting a lot of information from some of our representatives and we can share what we know in regards to testing and where people can go and so on, and so forth.
We also submitted the science edge relations that the Community board has said, which was 12 a.m. They, will stop serving beer and wine by 11:00 p.m. The restaurant winner for many years without a liquor license correct any other questions.
Am we have food, the restaurant on Wickham, and so a lot of people want to get some They ask for celebration, and the first thing they ask is some greens some contain What you've been doing over the past year, because you've had wine and beer and what makes your risk for and different?
In our neighborhood and initially the city granted us a building permit Then the new year came when we had to renew our permit and the city said no, because my landlord, so you know we thank you so much open the board.
We are a family- owned restaurant specializing in Latin food we've been operating for 19 years and proud to say that we have established a restaurant in this community to everyone in our community and especially for people outside of our community, and we hope to continue our services and duty for our community And I'm glad that we're able to be home and safe all right.
All right I need to be able to hear all the board members voting.
So, a yes vote is a yes AM Brown, yes, Pandya, yes, Mr. Chowdhury, no Vivian doc, another English, No Navarro's, k, seed, no Edward, Kiernan, So I like to welcome everyone again to our Queens community board number three and my boo from the chairs.
I said: I live in the center of a national pandemic that has impacted our wonderful community of East, armours, Jackson, Heights and North Corona, have personally lost family members and friends to cope at 19 And I know many of you have too, and we also know many that have recovered, but the precious lives that we have lost has been very painful so staying in our homes to protect ourselves wearing our gloves wearing our masts standing six feet away from each other.
For me, personally, I know a lot of you I'd like to thank all of our essential workers, who's on the front.
I want to let you know that the Community Board office is still operating.
I participate in a number of teleconferencing calls updates from the Department of Health, the mayor's office and other agencies and I have been advocating to get additional testing sites for our district.
It's very important and So much for your support and I am available to provide any assistance so that that's We have been on a number of calls and we have been advocating for our area, because Ellmers hospital should not be an option for our neighborhood to go to as a testing site only or the only option.
Yes, the medical exam, the coroner's office, one of the things that I'm noticing in the community and other people have called me.
Also excuse, me, Mrs. fellow speaking, I also know that there were some articles that mentioned that a lot of people who live in our area actually work, probably in Manhattan, but in certain services, where they would have come into contact with a lot of people.
I. Do not like many people do work in Manhattan, so just using mass transit, even you know, and we are very densely populated, area, With, a lot of people.
A community check, in with key stakeholders to discuss Koba 19, ongoing impact with concerns ranging from on the coil more about testing sites from closure, health, care, small businesses and other Koba 19 related issues that are happening here to New York.
You want to ask that everyone takes measures to stay informed and we are encouraging people to sign up for nightly updates from your state with the latest news on the government response to the pandemic, and they can do that by signing up online on the governor's executive, website.
So everyone know we are open our office in practicing our six foot distance because we're not letting anyone in, but you can reach us if you'd like to speak to someone live between the hours of 10:00 and 2:00 Monday to Friday the Assemblyman.
We will now be able to provide hotel rooms to all healthcare workers who are at risk of being exposed or contracting Kovan 19 at work and feel that they may be putting their families at risk by going home and, in addition to that, community- based referrals will be such that new individuals can participate if they are unable to socially distance at home.
No, problem, good Jessica, I do not know if you heard the question about the response time for the medical examiner's office.
Honestly, it's the most comprehensive thing, I've, seen so far for New York City residents in terms of lumping together a bunch of a bunch of information about how people can be helped, whether it be tenants, property, owners.
Many of you know that I just want to remind people that there they are.
