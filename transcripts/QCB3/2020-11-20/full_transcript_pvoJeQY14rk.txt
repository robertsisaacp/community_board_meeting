Nothing happened, I heard not a thing, nothing. It was quite boring. Actually very uneventful, wouldn't you say: Renetta I always love Renetta's response of no response, just the smile. It says it all join the right meeting toy my son's in the next room like who's yelling, what's going on you're exciting, but not that exciting I don't bring. All of that excitement into the room and look Julie Kim has to join our first meeting and to get this kind of excitement. This is definitely experience. This is the last time we're going to do that. One was blocking the driveway and the dispute was with the driveway right dispute and Mr Chaudhary I hear you. There are people blocking my driveway at all times. At the time there was a giant school bus with protesters blocking my driveway but I didn't say anything they were exhibiting their first amendment right to protest. I see Heiko, I'm going to mark you present Heiko Cool thanks man good to see everyone, I'm probably going to have to do that. I might have to do like Miss, Nimmins, Dr, Nimmins, I, see you and there's mark and Lisa Elba Ed toy I see you Mr Chowder Dorothy Marlene I might have to do attendance again. We were barely scraping by with Quorum Ooh top Michigan Republican says Trump should concede election breaking news on Cnn, not that I'm saying it. It's just on the banner of me you're on Mutenet I can't hear you if you're saying Kevin, you have to be nonpartisan, I'm just recording the news, I'm just reporting this exactly his opinion. No, so everybody for joining the meeting again it's the meeting started out where I can't give control to control the meeting to Kevin and and as you can see, we were go to meeting bombed and this was the second time this has happened to us and it happened to us at a business echo meeting and we think we know who it may be and we're not going to accept that anymore. So our meeting telephone number will not be published and we're going to possibly move from go to meeting to zoom, where it's going to give us a lot more control, I'm waiting for Miss Reed and for Keisha to come back in the room and for Clara, because they're contacting all of the speakers that I know we're not going to have members of the public on today, but we will be shut, we'll be publishing the meeting on YouTube and it will be accessible to the public. So today was not today was a little bit more interesting than it needed to be, and it's unacceptable what we went through at business echo- and it was unacceptable what we went through this morning this earlier this evening, and it was the same tape with that nasty racist, misogynistic craziness. Oh yes, it went it did everything it covered all these tonight and we queen's Community board number three does not do that. So it's unacceptable, so the technology team we're going to have a meeting asap, because this can't happen again. Are you able to make me organize her again? Renee? No, it's really funky I! Don't know what's going on it's weird, so it's going to you should be able to just you should be able to just click on my name. Actually, you could probably just click on my photo on the little three dots. Oh gosh, let me send this to Keisha here. Okay, I need to send this to Keisha and to I tried Kevin and for some reason it's not it's really acting up. Okay, let me send this to okay. Keisha may I suggest that we turn off the recording until we're ready to actually begin. Okay, I am so I. Think I'm going to let you open up with your presentation, since some most of the members are on I, don't know if you want to show us yourself and I, just don't have a deck or anything like that. Okay, no problem here we go. The welcome. Jessica has been a wonderful asset to Queen's community board number three anytime. We needed what we need. Any information that we need masks. It's been a wonderful relationship, so go ahead thanks, so I'm going to just touch base on a few things, but I think my just my information is going to kind of overlap a little bit with Julie's. So one largely the city's concerned about the rising Covid-19 case numbers, but we do still believe we can fight back a second wave. So some area specific numbers we have for Corona North Corona, the positivity is 5.81 for the Laguardia Airport east Elmhurst area is 4.44 for Jackson Heights, it's 2.82, so there is a range there, but still it does indicate those numbers are going higher, and so yesterday we announced the closure of school buildings, which is a temporary closure as we're just trying to get a handle on these rising case numbers the schools that when we did open the schools earlier on, we had the gold standard of health and safety measures, including blended learning, socially distanced classrooms, mandatory mask wearing widely available testing and a contact tracing program. So all of this overlapped to you know, coupled with the three percent threshold at which we would close schools to result in a positivity rate that has been below 0.5 percent. So our schools have been very safe. But, as we've now crossed this threshold, there has been an increased concern in the spread of the coronavirus. So in discussing the reopening of schools, we'll be focusing increasingly on testing and message. We're getting out to families is that we need testing consent, forms to be brought back to schools and to be submitted. We're focusing on getting kids back to school, working with staff to organize windows for the food pickup with the grab-and-go meals, we're working with families, so that all students have remote learning devices. We are continuing to have Learning, Bridges, open and really just trying to facilitate this transition very temporarily to a distance learning model. Now the current closure is expected to last a minimum of two weeks, but we will be working with the state to figure out what the reopening will look like and with the upcoming holidays. We are concerned that we're going to cross a threshold where the state will be dis, declaring New York City as an orange zone, so we're encouraging folks to keep wearing their masks, washing their hands socially distancing and getting tests. We've had a great testing site at Traverse park, the last couple of weeks in Jackson, Heights and, of course, recognizing that we're in the holiday season we're encouraging everyone not to gather not to travel and to really just keep it very immediate, very small, if they're having celebrations for thanksgiving to just kind of highlight a couple of initiatives that we've had more generally in the city recently, one is the open storefronts program which began on October 30th and will be running until December 31st. This is a program, that's modeled, similarly to the open restaurants program and it's permitting store from businesses to use a portion of their sidewalk to display merchandise, sell goods, complete transactions and provide line-up areas, we're encouraging all New Yorkers to shop locally, this holiday season to support our small businesses and secondly, a more traditional initiative. We have is our desk and darkness campaign. It's our fifth one! Where we just remind motorists how dangerous fall and winter evenings are for pedestrians and cyclists, especially after clocks, fall back for the end of daylight savings time, there's also a similar education effort taking place around state laws which require all motor vehicle passengers to wear seat belts, and so lastly, I just want to again emphasize the importance of continuing to practice all of our health and safety standards and to please get a Covid-19 test and have a happy and safe thanksgiving. Hi can I ask a question. Sorry yeah about the testing in the schools. I understand that from the different schools that I spoke to that some students, parents didn't sign the consent form, so they didn't have to take it. And so what's what happens if they don't sign? It I understand that there are different measures that some families feel more comfortable going to their local doctor going to doctor of their choice to get their child tested. But really we then just ask families to monitor symptoms if a child is sick to stay home and to report if they have that positive Covid-19 test. But this is obviously a concern. It's a gap in the standard that we've created and emphasizing again that when we reopen schools, testing will be a focus. So this is why we really are now putting out that message and doubling down on the fact that we really need those consent forms sent back to schools. So it's voluntary. So if they don't do it, the student can still come to school just well. You can't we're not saying that you can be in school if you're sick, we're saying that if you're sick, you're supposed to stay home and kids are wearing masks and it's a small classroom and kids are socially distant, but we are saying that we really need kids to submit those testing forms, because we can't force students to be tested. Okay, because I thought that originally they're going to say if they don't bring them in, you know more than twice if they're asked twice, then they have to go to all remote the student themselves. But if that's not the case, I just don't know how else we're going to stop this. If people aren't you know, if we don't have to force these students to take the test or bring in the permission slip, I, don't think they should be well. I mean okay, I, just hope that more people comply. That's all okay! Thank you. I have a question also go ahead. Sorry, we also have Julie Kim, that's going to speak next and she's from test and trace. So, along with you know, oh okay! Well, this is good is, is there a place so where we can go online or call to find out where the testing sites are that are readily available? Besides the the city clinics that are there they're the so, though, that website is Nyc.Gov Covid-19 test, okay, also call 311 and supply your zip code and they'd be happy to help as well. Now also is that site on Broadway and Northern Boulevard still open. Is that open and available to for people to be tested? Rapid testing site is open, I believe they just opened it sorry, which one a northern Boulevard rapid testing site? Yes, the Sports Authority parking lot. Yes, it's open, it's been open, but it now has rapid testing as well. Very good. Thank you all right. So we're going to have one more speaker, that's coming in now and then we're going to have you go Julia Julie! Is that okay yeah all right so we're waiting for that speaker to come on in and in a minute renetta, yes, Sir I believe the Disa Lady is trying to get into the meeting. Okay. Let me text her right now. Well, I sent her the link. She says she's sitting in the queue waiting she's not on the right link, then I hope this is not I hope. It's not doing that, because we're expecting someone to join the meeting, I'm going to tell her to log to exit and log and try again because Arthur just joined, so he didn't have any problem. Okay, Julie! You can go ahead and then, when we expect, we may break your speed you're speaking for this other speaker, but go ahead. Okay, yeah I can keep this short. Is it possible to share my screen yeah? Let me see hold on for a second hold on for a second Nathalie Nathalia. Yes, that's me. Are you one of the applicants for the street code naming okay, you can just wait for a second all right, I'm going to share your screen here, I'm going to share your screen or you could share. Let me give the ability to share your screen. Julie there you go. Did it pop up? Okay, very good, this specific go-to meeting, so I'm just going to try to do this more quickly. Okay, can you all see the screen, or is it too small yeah just make it maximize it into your regular screen, size, yeah, very good, okay, great okay, so I'll be quick since Jessica was able to say a lot of things, I was going to say anyway, so I just want to make clear that there are three components to the test and trace team. So there is the testing portion, which you know we're encouraging everyone to get tested, especially those who are out and about to get tested more frequently. Even if you don't have symptoms and I think that's the important thing that we're trying to let everyone know that you don't need to have any symptoms to go get tested. You know we have heard of cases of people being asymptomatic and having tested positive or Covid-19, so we're just encouraging everyone, especially before the holidays, to go and get tested at your nearest testing site and then tracing. So the tracing portion of this is, if anyone does test positive, they will get a test from our tracer and they should expect that they will get that phone call and if they don't pick up, you might find a tracer at your doorstep. So we just want to make sure that everyone knows that our tracing team is out and about and making sure to contact everyone who has gotten a positive test and the reason and what the tracers will do is once someone does have. A positive test is make sure that they're connected with all the resources available and I'll talk a little bit more about that. But yes, you can find your nearest testing site at Nyc.Gov, Slash covatest at no cost yourself and I will send out a full list of the testing sites every week, but the closest one to here you can just go on the website and look to see. What's the closest one, I would say, probably the sports authority, which just opened the rapid testings I just opened or the Elmer's hospital would be a good bet and then the take care portion is you will you know first for folks who don't who aren't able to quarantine or self-isolate, and the take care program will offer hotels, food delivery, medication, delivery, even pet walking pet services for those who will need to quarantine, and you can visit test and Trace.Nyc.Gov Trust and trace the NYC to look at those resources. We're encouraging everyone to practice the core force of staying home if you're, sick, keeping your social distance and wearing a face mask as well as keeping your hands clean and getting tested more frequently, there has been some new holiday guidance that has been issued, that is on our test and Trace New, York, Health and hospitals website. But really to sum it up is to keep it small this year and don't gather and not to travel. So the other thing that I would like to talk about is just quickly how we can partner with community Ward 3 and some of the organizations that might be represented here today, which is promoting. You know: basic Copio, 19 prevention through digital Outreach, social media, promoting the nearby testing sites. If anyone does need palm cards or masks and would like to do a day of action, you can totally reach out to me and we can schedule that as well as hosting a micro site. So we are starting to use more of the self-testing kits, so we want to be more flexible, especially with the long lines that are happening recently. So if anyone has an idea for a self-testing site because it is getting so cold, we are planning on doing these indoors. If you have an idea for a space that is not near a current testing site that can host a self-testing day a cell testing day, please reach out to me. We are looking for locations, it's very flexible, we go. All we need is a table. We bring the kits and that's the latest in the self-testing, so that's pretty much it I wanted to keep it short since I know, Jessica already has pretty much stated, the other things that I was going to say. But if there's any questions you can feel free to ask. Does anyone have any questions for Julie I have a question: how long does it take for the results to come back for after testing throughout the test? You get it really within 15 minutes, but I recently got a self test and I got it within a day, but it's maximum 48 hours, but mostly it's been coming back within a day or two excellent. Thank you. What would you guys think sorry, hello, hi? It's Chuck Schumer, so sorry about that. This, I'm sorry wasn't nobody else. My name is Juan Montenegro, I'm we'll be Dr, Rubio's nephew and you spoke about the self-testing day and you need a site. I would be able to host a self-testing days or multiple of you still need this right. Hi, sir, can you please type that information in the chat? Yes, I will. Thank. You could keep yourself on mute and Julie. Thank you very much. We have our senator chuck Schumer who's on hello, senator Schumer. How are you doing? Hi, hello? Everybody welcome to Queen's community board number three Jackson Heights, Elmhurst and North Carolina. Welcome you, yes, I know you're, it's not. It may be known. I ride my bicycle all over the city on Saturdays and I ride through your district. Quite a bit welcome go ahead! Yeah. Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you yes, okay. So what I'd like to do is first speak for about 10:12 minutes about some of the things going on and we're trying to do or 15 and then spend about 15 minutes on questions. Is that too much time for you all or no that's perfect, okay, great okay! So first thank you and I want to thank I can't see. Most of the pictures up here is Renata English. Here your chair want to thank her. I'm right here. Where are you see, I? Guess it's I'm getting! No pictures on my little I got ta view and view who's talking it's at the top there, but that's okay, good! Well, Renata! Thank you and Giovanna Reid and thank you. Everyone for serving on community boards. I know it's not easy to serve on a board. Those of you who are members of the board when things go wrong, you hear it from everybody when things go right, people don't say thank you that much when you're a community board member, so I just want to. Thank you for all the good work you do. Community board 3 is such an important place in New York, it's the future and the idea to provide the ladders up in terms of services and opportunities and everything else for the members of your constituency is vital. So let me say a few things here. First, as everyone knows we're in the midst of one of the greatest crises this country has ever faced. This is the worst economic crisis since the great depression and the worst health crisis. In a hundred years. Since the spanish flu 250,000 people are dead, every one of us knows someone who has died. Your board hasn't been hit particularly hard, 11.6 million cases of Covid-19 and with all this happening, president Trump and the right-wing Republicans who occupy the Senate, don't want to do a damn thing. We did get them to do some things early in March in the cares. Act, I'll talk about that in a minute, but they're just sitting on their hands and we're fighting them tooth and nail and we have to, and then we have a third crisis which is probably on people's minds too, and that is democracy, will Donald Trump, who has lost the election, be able to subvert our democracy, and the good News here is I think he's going to have a very difficult time. The system works pretty well and ah now, I have many more pictures, that's good. Whoever did that. I can see you much better some of you anyway, but in any case we have our democratic senators. We have the best lawyer, a guy named Mark Elias, he's going to court left and right to prevent trump from doing this and guess what he's won almost all of his cases, even republican judges in and state and federal judges and in conservative states realize Trump's claims are so outlandish that they reject them. He says, there's for it, I don't know. If some people saw today Rudy Giuliani, not my favorite character, he had a temper tantrum and then they said to him. Well, where's your evidence that there's fraud and he didn't have any they're just saying these things and they're all afraid. The republican senators are all afraid of trump, but in almost but you know- and they think well remember back in Florida, where, frankly, the Democrats didn't fight hard enough and the election was done by the Supreme Court. The difference is that Florida was only one state that was contested that made the difference and it was only 527 vote difference. We have six states and the least of all those states is 11,000 votes change, Biden won by 11,000 in Arizona, so they won't be able to overturn it and then on the 16th of December, the elect and oh and this other idea that they're going to be able to put in different electors than the electors. The people elected utter am I, I'm from Brooklyn I. Sometimes it's utter am I allowed to say that Madam chair. Yes, even though you're please saying those kinds of words, you know you're from gentile Queens and I'm from Brooklyn, that's okay, yeah I, know Queen's in Brooklyn we're brother and sister, of course, brother and brother or sister, and my parents live in Queens. So anyway. So it's bull and you need the governors to go along to replace the electors and guess what Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin have democratic governors, so they can't screw around. So Trump will rant and rave, but he's not getting anywhere and he'll try to do some things to screw up the country in the next few months, but he can't change that. He can't change that we're going to beat him in the election, so let me go through a couple of things on Covid-19 relief, because I know that was a question that you had I. You know back in March when the crisis hit. We did get some cooperation from some of the Republicans not much but some, and but they wanted to get a bill done. So we did a lot of good things. We increa. We got unemployment insurance at 600 a month and we expanded the number of people who were getting it to part-time workers, gig workers, freelancers and others who never got it and that kept 10 million people out of poverty. We got money for small business, small businesses, you're a community of small businesses and I, had a discussion a few months ago with the Corona Elmhurst I think it was the small Business Association and we got some money for them. I made sure that non-profits were added and for those of you who are members of churches, we have even allowed the churches to be added because there's no collection, plate and churches do a lot of our social service. So do the non-profits, and so we got money for that. We got money for the MTA. We got them four billion, so they didn't have to shut down. We got a lot of money for the hospitals. Many of our hospitals would have shut down. Elmhurst hospital. Is that in your board? Or is it a little south of your Elmhurst hospital yeah? They would have shut down without the help we got them. We got about a billion dollars for our school, so they wouldn't have to cut school aid and we got money, for we did a moratorium. So no one could be kicked out of their house if they couldn't pay rent. We got some money to help feed people. It was a pretty good bill. Here's the problem. Everyone thought in March that Covid-19 would be gone by the summer, so most of these programs have run out and now we're in the fight of our lives to get them renewed and expanded. So we want to expand the unemployment insurance for six months. We want to expand the ppp, the money that went to the small businesses, the non-profits and the churches. For six months we want to make sure our schools get the money to open safely. You know no parent wants to send their kid to a school, that's not safe, but if you, your kids are home and you're working. What the heck are you going to do so we provide. We want to provide a whole lot of money, so the schools can open safely, so they can get the ppp. So they can. You know you can't have two kids riding next to each other on a bus. You need more bus routes. You can't have second thirty. Second graders on zoom. You can have six or seven, but not thirty, so you need more time for teaching and all that. So we do that in this bill we give a lot of money to the MTA, so they'll keep going. We give money to the state and local governments and the first bill we gave about New York got about 10 New York state got about 10 billion, New York City about 5 billion, but we give them a lot more, so they won't have to lay off workers. So many of our people work for the city and the city. Jobs are a ladder up. Without this money there could be a whole lot of layoffs, and so we put together all of these things and then there was special money. How many of the restaurants have closed in your area? I'll bet a whole lot, so we give money for six months a grant to restaurants, so they can stay open. We do the same with other small businesses like independent venues, so they can stay open. They can use the money for what they need. This has all passed the house of representatives, all the things I mentioned to you money, oh 100 billion dollars to help people pay the rent or help people pay the mortgage if they lost the job through no fault of their own. How are they going to pay the rent? Should they be kicked out of their house and be homeless? No, so we put money in for that as well, and we also you're an immigrant community. We expanded a lot many immigrants, I'm a big immigrant guy pro-immigrant. We expanded the abilities of immigrants to get this money, whether they're, small business, people or others which the first bill didn't because the Republicans blocked it. All of these things passed the house and we're fighting Mitch Mcconnell in the Senate, but listen to this I live in a never land world. There are 20 republican senators in the Senate of the United States who want to spend zero dollars zero. They are supported by these very wealthy people, rich people, and they don't want to pay any taxes and they don't want any government regulation. So Mcconnell and those 20 senators have been blocking things, but we're fighting them, and maybe we can get something done there if I get to. If and that's for the next month or two. As many of you know, I'm trying to get to be the majority leader of the Senate. We need to win those two seats in Georgia, we're fighting very hard working with somebody, Stacy Abrams, who has been a great leader in Georgia to win, and we have a chance of winning. We have a good chance of winning if we win I become the majority leader and all the things I mentioned will happen in the first few weeks that we get to be in the majority, all of them, so we're fighting very hard for that and I will just add as a little commercial here. Anyone who knows someone in Georgia has friend family business. Please call them and tell them to vote and vote for the two democratic senators. One is a guy named ossoff he's from the suburbs, and one is a guy named Raphael Warnock, who is the pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist church, which is Martin, Luther, King's old pulpit, it's probably the most famous pulpit in America and guess what he lived here in New York for four or five he's a Georgian, but he lived here for four or five years. He was the deputy pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist church in Harlem, where Calvin Butts presides and I know. Calvin butts I think he comes from your Elmhurst. I've been to the Elmhurst church where Calvin got right. What's the name of the church I: go there all the time, First Baptist, Church, First, Baptist developers where I think is he that's where he was raised anyway? He knows Warnock well. So if we win these two, we can get all this done and if you- and if any of you want to help in the campaign, you don't have to go down to Georgia, they have phone back. You know you can do a lot of this virtually in this new world. If you want to get on the phone and persuade people to vote and tell them that this will mean all these things which they matter to community board three, they matter to Georgia. In fact, they matter even more to Georgia, because we require in there that the Georgia's, the very it was a very right-wing, regressive state and they didn't expand Medicaid. So during code that lots of people don't have health insurance down there and we would require him to expand Medicaid and that's one of the ways that Warnock and I suffer campaigning expand. Medicaid like we did and many other states did so that's important final thing. I'll say before I do questions. Okay, if I get to be a majority leader, we can do a whole lot. We can do a lot on climate. I've worked very hard on climate change, but we'll make sure that climate helps average people of color smaller communities. It's not just one thing: I will get an immigration bill, passed, I am passionate about immigration and we will have a path to citizenship for all of the immigrants who are here, they're, so important to our community and they work so hard. All they want to do is work hard and become Americans. We'll have the doctor kids put in there. We will get this bill passed, we'll do a big infrastructure bill and in that infrastructure bill we require that it's going to be 10 million new jobs, good paying jobs, it's a trillion dollars of infrastructure highways bridges, but also you know clean energy and all that people who are out of work, get trained for the jobs or have low paying jobs and it'll create a huge ladder up for so many people, and that is another thing that we could get done. We would fully fund the MTA, so you know they wouldn't have to worry about cutbacks and reducing service and all right. We would also restore our democracy. All right get rid of pardon yeah, okay, senator Schumer. We have a couple of folks started. Writing questions and I know because we have a we. Our meetings started a little later, but one last thing we would allow instantaneous voter registration. You show up, you can vote that would allow many more people to vote and change America. In this we allow DC to become a state. They are not represented and we would get rid of that horrible citizens United Decision, which allows all these very wealthy people to send millions of dollars, and you don't even know they're doing it all right. Okay, all right, so Megan a lot of issues I want to get out, we've covered them all in a short amount of time, and we thank you for what you're doing in Washington Megan. Thank you, hi Megan, hello, good evening. Senator thank you for joining us. I wanted to ask about what could be done with respect to the push to cancel student debt before January 20th and after January 20th, including with respect to the extension potential push to convince Trump to ex push out the current relief past expiration at your okay Megan. We will go a lot further than that. Elizabeth Warren I, don't know if you've read about this. Have a proposal that on day one that Joe Biden becomes president, he can sign a what's called an executive order. You don't even need the Congress, the heck with the Republicans, who won't do this, and fifty thousand dollars of debt for every student would be gone. 73 of all students would have no more debt and 97 percent would have greatly reduced it. Do you know the outrage of this folks, these the folks who are paying their debt they're, paying seven percent and guess who they're paying it to in large part, the federal government, the federal government's making a profit on the backs of the students? So this has gotten a lot of play and thank you for asking my proposal along with Elizabeth Warren is fifty thousand dollars of student debt goes away immediately gone. What trump did is he just said you didn't have to pay during the moratorium, but we would go much further and we don't need to win the Congress win. The Senate for this Biden can do it on his own. We have petitions, I will get to your board our website and if you want to sign the petition and circulate it, I think we have two million signatures already can I just ask a quick follow-up. Are you overlooking to lower the interest rates on the balances that remain outstanding, and are you also looking to look into revision so that we're not taxed on forgiveness of indebtedness, income yeah part of our bill is when we get rid of the debt you're, not it's not a gift and you don't pay any tax on it. The 50,000 goes away and you don't have any liability. So if you, and but second with the remaining debt, let's say you have 75,000 of dollars of debt, so you'd still have 25. We would greatly lower the interest rate right now. People are paying seven. If you go out for a mortgage, you pay for. If you buy a car, you pay three or four. How come we're asking the students and the people who went to school to pay seven. So that's part of our proposal all right! Thank you! Kevin. You have a question. Hi senator Schumer Kevin used about I'm the board secretary. It's an amazing pleasure to meet you virtually I'm a big fan. You and Speaker Pelosi you're, like my favorite couple to watch on TV, so keep on fighting the good fight. Renee said I had to have a question so here's my question: we're going to flip the Senate right, we're going to I'm willing all right. Thank you so much for joining us tonight, Senator Schumer. If we flip the Senate, we could do so many good things that they have blocked all right, so I see one hand raised Kev I mean Frank and we'll have one more question. After Frank, hi Frank, hey how you doing senator Schumer. It is a pleasure to have you at the board. I. Remember your first election in Brooklyn. It was a great event a great day on Eastern Parkway. Yes, all right, you know we're basically a hard working board. People come from many different walks of life, but basically we work very hard for what we have there's an issue here of the air train. We have mass unemployment, we have mass sickness here. We also have a food crisis where you could see two times a week where people are actually lined up for three to six blocks for food pantries. What is your take on an air train? That's going to take 2.05 billion dollars to build and not benefit this community at all? Okay. Well, let me say: I, don't know the issue of the air train. I was told right beforehand. I'd get asked, I'll study it, but I don't know the issue. My job is to get the MTA money, so the fare doesn't go up and they don't fire people. We got them four billion in the last bill. This bill is for 12 billion. So that's what authority, sir? It's actually the port authority, which is still run by governor Cuomo, we're trying to get state aid to the governor and city a to the mayor, but that's separate, and they could give that I guess. But I'm not familiar with that issue. I know it's I know it there's many sides to it: okay, yes, it is, and I'm sorry the second person, oh frank, the environment, on the food banks in this bill that we passed the house that I want we would raise snap permanently. We would also give the food banks much more food. They're running out of food, I, see it all when I ride my bicycle over the city. I, do it and you know I- know small business. My dad was a small businessman. He had a little exterminating business and he struggled his whole life. He would pace the floor, Sunday nights at 2 a.m because he hated going to work, but now God praise, God, he's 97 and he's a funny guy. He said: I was an exterminator. How bad could ddt you've been I'm 97. all right? Is there anyone else, one or two more people? Okay, there you go mark and then we're going to end with Arthur Tyler go ahead. Mark Right, thanks Vernetta hi, Senator, really nice to talk with you, I guess: I wanted to piggyback off of a couple of things you mentioned, and that Frank also asked about the food bits. I help operate a food bank, a food pantry on Roosevelt Avenue every week, and so many people of the families that see us are undocumented immigrants that have been cut out of all of the Covid-19 relief. I'm just asking if you would be able to push hard I know it's going to be politically difficult, but push hard to and make sure that our undocumented neighbors are included in the next Covid-19 relief bill. Yes, they in the house bill that passed. They are included for food for rent and for the small you know the Ppp, the small business program lets the employer pay the employees, so they don't leave and because the employer doesn't have money and they don't check you, they don't ask your documentation. My dream mark is to pass comprehensive immigration reform where all of our immigrants documented and not can have a path to citizenship, and you know what that would do for our economy. Speaking of the economy, which Frank talked about wow, it would set it loose because people wouldn't be looking over their shoulders. They could get what job they wanted. They'd work, hard immigrants work so hard, and you know it just so. Pisses me off that Donald Trump makes immigrants a a FOIL and tries to get people in middle America. You know the people who dislike immigrants the most are from places where there are very few immigrants, because they don't really see them and know how hard they work. All right. Arthur, Tyler and Arthur. There's Arthur on YouTube am I unmuted, yeah, you're, updated. Now all right, good senator! We are bicycle fans here and we've spotted you on 34Th Avenue yeah, that's one of my favorites on Northern Boulevard Arthur, one of my favorite bike routes. He's got to take 34th Avenue all the way down, and thank you for making it bike lane. Yes, yeah now that was our assemblyman Lafayette. Who did that and it was very nice anyway. Are you talking about Raphael, Warlock and I'm sure you've heard his blood libels? Is there any way to control people like that? You know I, it's terrible he's. He scares the daylights out of me. I haven't heard any other senator talk like that yeah! Well, Raphael Warnock! No he's a fine man they're putting these commercials about him, which distort his record completely he's a very honorable man he's a person of God he's a preacher and Stacey Abrams says that he would be one of the best senators that she would ever have seen. So don't worry he's not don't believe the don't believe the commercials of the right wing, Republicans they're, trying to make him into a demon and, frankly part of their demonization is racial. Are you saying that the blood libels that he made were not really said by him? I believe I, don't know what you're referring to, but my I'm pretty sure who's in Israel. You know we're shooting down on Palestinians and things like that. He I don't know you're referring to, but he is I'll. Send you a knockout I know but I'll send you Arthur I'll, send you an op-ed. He wrote he's pro very pro he's pro-Israel all right enough. Thank you. Arthur all right, I have a quick question. Can we get on that last two questions will be Nula and then you doctor nimmins, go ahead and walk, go ahead. Nola you have to turn your vid, so Senator Schumer, I'm kind of horrified that you don't know so much about the Laguardia Air train. It's a two billion dollar boondoggle that will really affect this neighborhood. It looks to take away our parkland. It looks to take away our view and access to the waterfront and overcrowd our transportation here, specifically our 7 train, and it's really kind of horrifying that the port authority, not the MTA, the port authority, has kind of pushed through this plan. It's kind of an old plan to bring what we call a backwards. Air train, a train that takes passengers from Laguardia East towards long island to Willard's point to go back to Manhattan and I'd really urge you to look into it because here's the neighborhood you're really going to be hurt right. All right, I, don't have much jurisdiction over the port authority and so I focus on federal things, but I'll take a look all right! Thank you. Oh there's a party here all right for federal funds. Okay, Dr Nimitz is the last question. Okay, a quick question just wanted to ask about the the way to help the Senate race in Georgia. You mentioned that we can call and get on phone banks you're not going to release he's going to send the information we're not going to yeah I'll, send it to the board. Okay, very good, great people and I will get you both phone number email and a website and to how you can help correct yes, because we want you to be the majority leader. We want you to be the leader, sir okay. Thank you all right. Thank you very much. Thank you. So much senator second class. There were a lot of other questions. I know you have a lot of business. I promise I'll come back after the election and we can talk more about things. Is that okay? That's very funny! Thank you and we look forward to seeing you around our neighborhood. Thank you, everybody and have a happy and safe Thanksgiving may God. Give you a good one. All right! Thank you. Family bye bless you and your family all right. So the next speaker will be the New York state D.O.T and who will be speaking for them. I think it's Thomas, Bayer I! Think it's Thomas! Bear are you? Oh, this is Thomas. Yes, and do you want me to give you the screen, so you can show your presentation I emailed the the slides to Keisha yeah, oh I, actually, I. Don't I'm on the phone now I'm on the train? Okay! So I'm going to you can just start talking about it and I'm going to look for your presents because we have it in our folder look ahead. Okay can I go ahead, all right, so the just to give you a quick overview. We started a New York state D.O.T project to replace the Astoria Boulevard South Bridge over the ramp from the eastbound BQE that connects to the eastbound grand central parkway. The project has begun, and just this week they started the the first phase of major construction and they set up a long-term lane closure on the eastbound on Astoria Boulevard South. This is this location is just east of St, Michael, Cemetery and just west of Booty street. The work zone they set up is on the right side. So what is set up is a long-term right lane closure. So the the lanes are reduced for the period of construction in order to replace the bridge deck. The scope of this project is to replace this approximately 60 year old, bridge deck that is in need of replacement. It's it circuits life and it's no longer. Okay, great. This is my screen here, all right, yeah stage, one okay, perfect so stage one construction is in place now, just as of this week, the lanes are reduced from three to two just in the location of the bridge. The scope of the entire project is just to replace the bridge deck and replace the railings and the walls on the sides of the bridge and repave the roadway leading up to the bridge on both sides, leading in and leading out, and to accomplish this, what the construction team is going to do, they're going to on the right side, where the south side of the bridge, the right side is traveling: east they're, going to construct a temporary pedestrian bridge to keep the pedestrians safe and out of the way of the reconstruction of the deck. So this in this stage that they just set up one of the first things they're going to do is build a temporary pedestrian walkway on a bridge over the ramp from the BQE. So that's the first thing you're going to do and then followed by replacing the bridge deck and all the utilities that are carried by the bridge in this stage. One and that'll take about roughly 10 months, or so it's a long stage because of the utility replacements and the construction and opening of the pedestrian bypass and stage. One is followed by stage two and stage two, the left, half or the north. Half of this eastbound bridge will be replaced and following stage two we'll have a short stage likely have a short stage: three and four, where the traffic is flip-flopped a bit for a month or two or three June to devalus the pedestrian bridge and well actually to rebuild the new pedestrian sidewalk on the south side and remove the pedestrian bridge and then finish off the bridge. So it's roughly a two year project. It's the contraction proposed this the method of construction in order to progress quickly. So the idea is to progress the pro this necessary deck replacement project quickly and to also keep the pedestrians, pedestrian, walkway, open and safe, and that's pretty much the project. Do you have any questions for me? Does anybody have any questions? As you can see, this is going to impact our neighborhood for the next two years. I do Renata. Okay, go ahead, I like to know what time will they be working on it because Northern Boulevard already has plenty traffic to be walking online during rush hour. Most of the work is going to be done during the daytime behind barrier. So once the barrier is set up for the work zones that creates the work zone for the who wants to work any daytime. Some work to be done during the night is done during night, but most have done during the day. All right does anybody else. Have any other questions, I'm sorry, I'm going to a quieter spot, so I can speak. Okay, all righty, all right once going twice my other question Renata will be: when will they try to do something about Northern Boulevard and in the grand central? When you come out of the grand central to Northern Boulevard to make a left there, that's really almost impossible most of the time. Well, it's something that we can talk offline about because and we'll take that information, because we need to see if it's D.O.T, okay, this is state. Okay, you just may be city D.O.T. Your question all right: okay, a quick question: can he put the map back up on the screen? I am not certain of that location, all right! It's right by St, Michael's right by the Bulova building that area. It's on the east bound yeah, there's over okay. So if you're driving on the story boulevard, you may not realize you're on an overpass, because it's it you can't it's a short overpass. You can't really see the roadway underneath it's right after the right. After St Michael cemetery I see it I see where it is, but as you're going right as you're going on to the grand central service road right, correct right before you it's just before you would end you would get on the ramp to enter onto the grand central it's actually right after a ramp from the grand central and right before a ramp back onto the grand central right. Okay, thank you. You're welcome anyone else. All right. Thank you so much you're welcome have a great day. Thank you all right. So we'll begin our public hearings, traffic and transportation. Steve is not here today, but Ed Kernan, the co-chair. He will begin go ahead. Ed Kiernan good evening. We have one proposal for street renaming for Dr Sergio I Rubio away from northern Boulevard, from 94Th Street to Junction Boulevard, with signage on the southwest corner of Northern, Boulevard and I. Believe 94th street is cuban. Is here I'm sorry Eddie, yes, discuss the proposal all right cuban hi! This is a cabin, a phone council member Daniel, Drum's office. Everybody hear me: okay, yes, okay great, so I'm here representing the office would like to ask for the community board's approval for the streetcar naming of Dr Sergio Ivan Rubio way so Dr Rubio, originally from Peru, received his veterinarian license from Peru in 1967, and he made his way to the United States in 1970 seeking the american dream. He applied to veterinarian schools to redo his studies and become licensed in the U.S, so he could practice his love of medicine, so with wife and the three children to care and provide for he achieved his dream in 1976 and passed the license in four states: that's New, York, California, Minnesota and Missouri, where he studied as a family. He was decided that New York would be the place to go home. He started his own practice as a house call that business working evenings and weekends and after his job as surgeon in by the way and north shore and Malik. Finally, he opened his clinic in 1980 in the most diverse county in the World Jack science Queens. Here he settled and delegated his entire career in 2017, going to semi retirement. He moved his practice to east Elmhurst, where he got to leave his last years doing what he loved most veterinarian medicine. Dr Rubio was a dedicated professional who didn't believe in Knight to five to do his job. He stopped for animals and his clients often had him stay overnight, watching and caring for pets that require extra care. In addition to be being the professional, he was a good friend, often providing advice, encouragement and friendship to neighbors and young people who got a chance to work with him and learn from him. He was the true Athens of achieving the american dream. He will always be remembered and tremendously missed. Thank you. There was a the Bio for Dr Rubio I, believe you all have a copy of the Bio, and we appreciate all of your support on this proposal. Thank you and I. Don't know anybody else here you can ask and see. Is there anybody else? A chairperson, my name is Beverly Carroll, I'm listed to speak, may I begin now with the Dr Rubio. Okay. Thank you. Yes, it is okay, very good. Yes, there are about five people that are planning to speak. Okay, very good! Sorry, ed! Thank you chair. I'm sorry go ahead, Beverly Sorry! Are you ready? Okay? Thank you, chair and board members for hearing our petition. My name is Beverly Carroll, I'm a part of a three generation family, entrusting our pets to Dr Rubio's care before I. Give my personal testament about Dr Rubio I would like to share what I discovered about street renaming in New York City I, located a listing online of individuals so honored across the boroughs and found that the reason fell into four categories. The one most relevant to our petition is honoring members of the community held in high esteem, Dr Rubio dedicated 40 years to our community. He worked six days a week. He stayed overnight with very sick pets, opened his office on Sundays his day off to comfort, an owner or to make special accommodation for his clients. He took time off for a rare vacation or to attend a veterinary conference, and yet he always called back to check with his office, regardless of where he was Dr Rubio. Besides being an accomplished, clinician was compassionate, warm generous funny and a bit of a Macgyver. My love and respect of this good man is echoed in the petitions we received. You should have received a copy of a sampling of petitions, together with the brief bio and letters prior to tonight's meeting. Their commentary paint a picture of the man whose passing we mourn. There is no doubt that Dr Rubio loved his clients and the petitions returned that love. My seven pets were cared for from puppyhood to senior care equaling many visits and firsthand observations here are some of my experiences. He only ordered needed tests. He approached care in a stepwise progression being mindful of the finances of his clients. He kept fees affordable to encourage well visits, which is good practice. He gave follow-up free care. Discounted visits waived an entire fee for special circumstance. He provided support follow-up with telephone calls and it was always accessible. He spayed and neutered when in the best interest of the Pet Dr Rubio, was truly our neighborhood vet held in high esteem and irreplaceable. Thank you, Beverly Ed Rosenbaum. You had something to say: okay, very briefly, I did not know the doctor, but I can say that I hope he doesn't mind. Sam Charelli, who used to be a member of our board pizza, Sam I, was a neighbor and he knew it. His entire life since Sam had been in the neighborhood 45 years or so and would always speak very highly of Dr Rubio. Thank you. I want to echo that sentiment, and is there another speaker here for Dr Rubio? Yes, the next speaker that we have listed is Mr Consuelo, Fernandez, I, don't know if he's on right now, Mr Consuelo, because I know that we were having issues with the link. So is there someone else hi Myra? Yes, thank you Beverly, yes, hi. Everyone I hope you can hear me I just wanted to say. Thank you for this opportunity to speak to you all today. My name is Maya Bermio and I wanted to express my most enthusiastic support for this street co-naming proposal. After Dr, Rubio was my neighborhood vet mentor and father figure for over 10 years. I worked with him as an intern in high school and later as a vet assistant after college, and this was all many years ago, Dr Rubio used his clinic as a place for physical and social healing, bringing animals owners and caregivers closer together. He celebrated love and care between people and their furry companions. Among the diverse immigrant community of Jackson Heights, he believed this unique diversity and culture made our community better. As a peruvian immigrant, he broke down language barriers and often adjusted costs to low-income clients. He was an avid believer that someone's love and care for their companion animal should have nothing to do with their socio-economic status after 40 years of serving in our community. He continued to provide honest, accessible and affordable services to many Dr. Rubio left us earlier this year, but many of our achievements were due to his influence. He inspired advised and mentored. Many like me to seek higher education. He encouraged me to be a citizen of change and serve as an animal and social Justice advocate. It is thanks to him that I now hold a masters in animal public policy. He was and represented a crucial unifier in our community to co-name this street after doc would be an opportunity to recognize the leaders who changed how we view the relationship between people, animals and the environment. Thank you, everyone for your time and consideration all right. Thank you spoke for Dr Rubio go ahead, Ed is there anybody else all right? Yes, Dr Papak is meant to be the next to speak. If he's here with us, yes hi, can you hear me yeah, we'll give you a minute Dr, Papek and then Steve? Do you want to say something? Yes, hi good evening? Thank you for the opportunity to be able to support the street. Naming for Dr Rudio I am a veterinarian. A foreign graduated I met Dr Rubio many years ago, and he always made me believe that it was possible for me to achieve my license, and so I did and I will always be grateful for his support. In reality, it will be very difficult to say all the ways that he had helped me. He was a really good professional and a wonderful teacher and I just want to say thank you for the opportunity again to support this street. Naming thank you and Steve. Garupp want to say something. I saw you put something in the chat. I just wanted to say you know thank you to everybody. Who's here to support I, know, there's a number of people that are not speaking right now, but I do really Dr Rubio is my granddad. He's always been a great role model, but I think he really defines something special for Jackson Heights as a really immigrant, a very diverse american community, where he really achieved an american dream and was able to show a lot of people and be a role model that you can achieve higher education and always strive for higher goals and make something great of yourself and so I. Thank everybody and thank you for your time from the board. Thank you so much Steve. Thank you. All that's spoken. Go ahead! We'll take this up in executive session. Thank you, Edmund business echo. Let me just make sure that the first app comes coming on, because I kind of like zoned out, okay, we did have other speakers, I didn't know. We had there because we ran a little late with the meeting, but we did get. We did hear about all the wonderful things that Dr Rubio did do in the community and we appreciate that and we do have the letter and of support from the councilman and other letters in our folder. So we can review that. Thank you. Steve go ahead! Edmond! Okay, welcome! I am I just contacted Clara. Our first applicant will be latino bites, 2 Llc, 8415, Northern Boulevard in Jackson Heights. This is an application for a new wine and beer license, hopefully they're coming on within. Second, can you guys hear me? Yes welcome how you doing how are you tonight, okay, you're, coming on alone, your representative also is coming up. I can't come on my own because you guys didn't send them a link. Really, okay, all right Edmund go ahead. Okay, so just give an overview of your business for us, similar to what you did at the at the committee meeting a fast food restaurant serve burgers, tacos, burritos, quesadillas, etc. We're not looking for a party crowd, we're not looking to give people like surf hard alcohol, we're just looking for families. Friends, people to come here, enjoy a nice dinner, be able to drink a glass of wine or drink some beer. Nothing crazy, not we're not looking for people to come and just sit and wait in the table and just drink all night. That's not our concept. We're basically here to serve the community plus other people that come for us from other communities and we're all we we're pretty decent restaurant, I'm pretty sure we're known I, don't know if you guys have heard of us before. Oh we've been in this location for the past three years and we're just opened up our brick and mortar homes and we're looking to basically cater to people. Okay, right, you've been in the same location relatively in a food truck correct, which is like across the street. Correct. Just tell us your house of operation for the for this location. Well, it's really hard to say because of everything that's going on right now. So it's hard to say you know this is what I want to do. This is the hours that I want to work, but actuality, there's rules right now that we have to respect so I would love to be open from 11 in the morning so well, if it was like how it used to be before everything happened. So a late crowd like people will come late from the clubs that want to grab something to eat so juice. A burger something for them to have, but unfortunately we can't so right now we could only be open till 10 as far as letting people and how many people fit in the location. Right now, we can only have like 18 people right, but if it were, if we didn't have the rules, how many fit with staff for around 70 something 70? Okay, because you said there was 40 seats which would be 28 indoor 12 in the rear patio. Is that correct? Oh yeah? So you said how many you said: 28 indoors and 12 on the patio 40. oh yeah, plus the staff yeah. Sorry, because I know this building is old and it doesn't have a certificate of occupancy. It's you know a level of objection, so it's a little bit open-ended in terms of occupancy. Okay, does any of the board members have any questions right now? Hi! This is toy. I do actually have a question hi so once open will you continue to operate the food truck simultaneously at the same time as well as the restaurant, and the reason why I asked that is just thinking about the flow of your patrons who may go back and forth for anything that could potentially, you know, come up in that realm. Thank you. Well, the the whole concept of us having the restaurant was to be able to move the food truck to another location. Okay, thank you. Yes, frank. First of all, good evening, I did I was maybe been remiss. I did not hear anything as far as police activity have you had any negative police activity at your locations or at this location we haven't gotten any we haven't had any problems like I said we're not we're is we're a little bit different, we're trying to bring a different type of vibe over here. We we're very. This is more like family oriented, friends, cousins, uncles that come here. They want to sit down and enjoy a nice fast food meal, because also our name is very popular at the same time. So a lot of people come from different places with their families to enjoy our what we have to offer to them. So we try as much as possible not to have any negative stuff. Okay, anyone else. Thank you, frank. Okay, we're going to take this up an executive session! Thank you! So next we will call Chipotle Mexican Grill of Colorado Llc, 3747, Junction, Boulevard and Corona application for a wine and beer license, we'll wait for them to come on. Did Clara call the person they're not answering, but the next two are present already. Okay, so go ahead and let's keep over then okay, so we're going to skip over chipotle and come back we're going to go to number three Vecinos Corp 8513 Northern Boulevard in Jackson Heights. This is an application for a full liquor license I believe Mr Miller is here. We can't hear you yes hi. How are you hello, Mr Miller, so just give us a brief overview of business plan. I mean it's going to be a brazilian tapas lounge. You know like I explained before we've been I've been with the least since March 4th, but we haven't been able to do absolutely anything because of this pandemic. I haven't even created a menu, yet you know, and I've been with you guys for this I think the third time with you guys on the board. Okay, does anyone have any questions? No one has any questions. Well, yeah I mean okay, frank, yeah. Well, you know you're opening up a business. Have you been a business owner before? What experience do you have and what are the hours there? What are you looking at? Can you be a little bit more expansive on what you're actually trying to do? I mean it's a it's going to be a brazilian tapas lounge. You know I've managed. I've managed a lot of places before my wife was as a chef in the park after he was a chef in the Park Avenue in the city she's. Currently not working. You know we discussed before you know you guys put a stipulation. We were going to open up seven days a week. You know, and you guys put a stipulation closing at three a.m. On sundays. You know, and everything else was open. Till 4 am during open at 4, am during the weekends and closing at 3 am Sunday and the other days, which is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Okay, have you filed your application? Yet? Yes, okay, have you been fingerprinted yet? Not yet? Okay, let me just ask: are you the 100 owner of the business? Yes, okay. Does anyone else have any questions? Okay, we'll take it up in executive session? Okay. So since we don't have chipotle on the line, yet we're going to go to Tradiciona, Tradiciones Mexicana's Corp, doing businesses with chiles 9607 37th avenue. This is a class change. Full liquor license yeah good evening. Thank you for having me. Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you welcome. Oh hi. My name is laytapia I am the owner of Tradiciones Mexicana's corps, doing business as Los Chiles restaurant and we're located at 9607 37th Avenue? We are asking if for a full liquor license, we right now are struggling honestly, so keep afloat. This pandemic has really come to hit us hard. We have fortunately been able to survive because of the extended summer. We've had very good temperatures until last week, so people are, you know coming in. We have outside seating, we have three tables outside, but it got cold now. So now it's getting very tough, so we do have food. We serve mexican food, we have 15 people capacity inside 15 person and this is including the employees. We have three employees so right now we are really struggling. Honestly. We had to dip in I had to dip into my savings and it's like it's a struggle, so we're asking the board if we can possibly like have, you know, be permitted to have a full liquor license and trying to you know have people come in, maybe have a drink or take. You know. We don't know where this thing is going. We might be closing pretty soon because the numbers are going higher now. So at this point it's kind of uncertain uncertainty, but I mean we've been there for three years. I've been there for three years right now we don't have any violations. We've been in good standing, so you know I just asked the board to consider giving us the follicle license. Please, okay, are there any questions? Yes, frank! Oh, it's not really! A question, though I just wanted to inform you that the the community board is starting a business acumen as far as the small businesses go and if you're in trouble of closing I think that when Edmund is Edmond is the chair of it. I think that maybe we can sit down together, maybe help some people out, and maybe this would be a candidate for that help. Well, thank you for that information. I didn't know that, like I told you, we've been able to keep afloat because, honestly the temperatures have been really good to us, but they just as soon as winter comes it's going to be worse and I know the cases are going up and we're seeing where everything's, headed and I think we're going to have to close, so I mean we're going to give me one last shot, but it's looking that way. Unfortunately, thank you. Okay, anyone else, okay, we'll take that up in executive session, we'll receive Clara tried again she's been trying and the lawyers had sent an email saying he wants to postpone and I. Don't know why. Okay, all righty, then thank you so we'll open our executive session. As you always know, we open it up anybody else, or that was the last one. That's the last one so we'll table the chipotle next month, then all right, everyone, so we'll open up the executive session with the pledge of allegiance, I pledge of allegiance to the flag, Right United States of America liberty and justice for all right. Thank you all for hanging in there for our longer than usual start of our meeting. It was very interesting. I will be talking with the technology committee to see what different tools that we will be using for future meetings, because we can not have that disruption that we had at the beginning of our meeting. I call for a motion to adopt our agenda. Second, all in favor motions by committee, traffic and transportation. Okay, so this is for the people naming Dr Sergio I Ruby Way Northern Boulevard from 94Th Street to Junction Boulevard. The sign is located on southwest corner of Muna, Boulevard and 94Th street. The committee met on Wednesday October 28th and by a vote of nine in the affirmative, zero in the negative of three abstentions. The committee recommends approval, so the motion is to approve.

Actually it's a mobile operation as the gentleman said and when it was pre-virus time, they'd great care to make sure that their surrounding area was very clean and I complimented him on it, because he not only took care of just where his truck was parked, but he'd go several deep into the street and make sure none of his customers were knuckleheads and threw paper around or that kind of stuff. So I support this very much. Thank you, ed. Any other discussion. Okay, seeing none, we call the question. Okay, this is for latino Bytes 2 Llc, located at 8415, Northern Boulevard, Jackson Heights.

The second applicant would have been chipotle mexican Grill of Colorado Llc. That will be tabled to December. So third applicant is casinos. Corp 8513, Northern Boulevard in Jackson Heights. This is application for a full liquor. License motion is extremely long. So let me get started Mo. The committee recommends disapproval of an application for an on-premises full liquor license for this applicant. Due to unwillingness to meet with the committee. Applicant principal of a lack of disclosure of applicant is filed with the New York State liquor authority and african principle, having violated the governor's executive order in New York state Alcohol beverage control law exemplifying the fact that the principal Nicole Mancini is a not a viable licensee. You have a second I'll start the discussion. Now the name Nicole Mancini is there and I had asked the applicant if he is the sole proprietor in the corporation he said no, the state liquor authority had received the application on the 15th of this month. Few days ago and Nicole Mancini has been fingerprinted and is listed as the corporate principal of this location. He is licensed in another location, which was summarily had a summary suspension and paid a large fine for violating the executive order and violating other ABC laws, also having a I'm just doing briefly having a familial relationship with the owner of the property as well. So based upon what is filed with the state liquor authority, we come to this conclusion. Is there any other discussion, I'm a little confused Edmund? So you think that he's not the true owner or you think there are multiple owners. He said, he's 100 percent, the only person that has been fingerprinted with the state and the state has on record for this application is someone else and what was his response to that? He said he is 100 percent owner. So we have no answer to the question. No, he answered the question. He said he was 100 owner. He just answered the question right, except for the fact that the liquor license submitted to the state is a different name. Exactly. Do we think that he has two names or do we think there's a second individual who's actually applying politically? The second individual is applying okay and also he they have not met with us in four months consecutively, and there is also one provision that the owner and the business businessman business and the landowner the same person right no she's, actually the stepdaughter of the landlord okay. It is possible that he could be the owner and the manager is the one applying for the liquid license. I, don't know if that could work manager can't apply for a liquor license they're only disclosed in the application can I ask a question about process. If we disapprove this license, what happens next? Can they reapply send in a new application that can actually have a hearing where they show up at your committee and then come here and they just restart or what is the process? It can happen. Yes, if we get another notification, we start a new process, because we have to act on every notification we get with the exception of an appeal, but that would have to be something new. So if we decline it's not, they can try again. Essentially, it basically goes along with the current application that we have. They can always file a new one, but this application was received by the state with someone else's name on anyone else. Okay, we'll call the question: we have a second correct. Yes, okay, all right! This is for the Cenos Corp located at 8513, Northern Boulevard Jackson Heights for a full liquor license. The committee recommends disapproval of the motion, so a yes vote is to disapprove the motion. All right, if you would rather approve the motion, then you would vote no all right. So a yes vote is to disapprove. A no vote is to approve Am Brown. Yes, Alba Buendia, yes, Mark Burmester, yes, Mr Chow Jing! No, do you understand how you're voting? Oh? Yes, I'm sorry, hi Coker I go Corneliusen! Yes, okay, Vivian Doc, yes, Vernetta English, yes, Mr Gandhi, all right, Mr, Gideon, yes, Pastor, Peter, Herron, yes, I haven't used a boa. I am a yes Edward Kiernan, yes, Marta Lebreton, yes, Lisa Masulem, yes, Laverne nimmins, yes, Nulo Authority; yes, Phillip Pappas; yes, the Visa Perez, yes, Dorothy Feylon, yes, Megan, Rockwell, Stain, Tammy, Rose Cheetah leave cliche to leave okay, Edmund Rosenbaum; yes, Marlene Tapper! Yes, thank you! Frank Taylor, yes, Arthur Tyler, yes, Chanel, Thomas, Henry, yes, Hamlet Wallace; yes, Troy, Washington, Simon, yes and Edwin Wesley. Yes, all right, 26 yeses to disapprove one abstention. The motion carries fourth and last application: Tradiciones Mexicana's Corp, doing businesses with chiles 9607, 37Th, Avenue, Corona, a class change and upgrade to full liquor. Our motion is committee, recommends approval of an application for a class change to an on-premises full liquor license for this applicant, provided the stipulation has been signed, stating the hours of operation will be 2 p.m, to 3:30 a.m. On a daily basis, there will be two licensed security guards present at all times. Alcohol service will end one hour prior to closing on a daily basis and kitchen will be open serving a full menu at all times. Stipulation has been signed and received have a second thank you, okay, discussion. First me, this stipulation is in line with the they signed for their wine and beer license as well. So we tailored it the same way as for this upgrade and everything was agreed upon. Is there any other discussion? Okay, you can call the question all right. This is for traditionals Mexicanus Corp doing business as Los Chiles located at 96-07 37Th Avenue Corona. This is for a class change, full liquor and the committee recommends approval. So a yes vote is to approve Ann Brown. Yes, Abu Bandhia, yes, Mark Burmester, yes, Mr Chaudhary, no Michael Cornelison, yes, Vivian Doc, yes, Brunette English! Yes, Mr Gandhi, Mr Gideon, yes, Pastor, Peter, Haron, no Kevin, Isabella I am a yes Edward Kiernan, yes, Martin lebreton; no, yes, Dorothy you're on you! Yes thank you. Megan Rockwell abstain, all right, Edmund Rosenbaum, yes, Marlene Tapper, yes, Frank Taylor, yes, Arthur Tyler; yes, Chanel, Thomas, Henry, yes, Hamlet Wallace; yes, boy, Washington, Simon, yes, Edwin Wesley!

Are you still on? Maybe she's gone all right lily? Are you there? No I'm here good evening! Everyone I'm going to keep it really, quick and short, just a reminder that we do have a Covid-19 test site at Laguardia Airport. It's in terminal b, I took the opportunity to go down myself at six o'clock on a Tuesday and had my results back by 10 am Wednesday. Please everybody get tested, take advantage of this opportunity. It has free parking, it was really easy and from the assemblyman happy Thanksgiving to all right James. Thank you lily all right, hi everyone. It's James here from the Office of New, York, City controller Scott Stringer got three updates. I'll, say very fast: okay, the first one I'm going to put in the chat right now. It shows that there is a 800 there, 834 million dollars of tax revenue, that's been collected that wasn't expected for the first quarter of our fiscal year. So that's some good news, even though our city is still in a lot of financial trouble, so check out that link for more information there, the second thing and most important thing, and I'm hoping that all of you on this call can really help me with. This is a survey that the comptroller's office has just put out. It is the work and family survey. What we are doing is we are trying to collect data on people who live in all parts of New York City, and we really need some more people from Queens to fill out. The survey is about how you are doing in terms of adjusting to the pandemic, with many of you working at home and also for those of you who now are being asked to go back to work. While you have children or perhaps other people to take care of, we want to know how difficult or maybe how easy it is for you. So a lot about the work life balance. We really need more respondents. Most of our respondents. Up to this point have been people that live in the wealthier areas of Manhattan and Brooklyn. So we really want some geographic diversity and racial diversity, ethnic diversity, all types of diversity, so we need more respondents. So I'm going to put that link in the chat right now and James Perfect James. All the members received the survey and we posted it on social media. Also, oh excellent. Thank you so much so, and those all right, so one more thing for the members. So thank you. If you've taken this sorry, you could put it in there, but we did they. Everyone received. It, though just want to let you know: okay, yeah! Thank you. So please take for those of you who are members of larger organizations, civic groups and so on. Please spread that survey within your own networks too, because we really need to get this out as much as possible. So I'll put it there in case, there's other people who want to look at it who aren't board members. Last thing, I'm going to put the link for our fiscal and economic outlook newsletter again. This is a weekly update, a weekly email that gives updates on the state of the city in terms of the Covid-19 pandemic and economic health. So if you click on the link that I'll post in a few moments, you look for the subscribe button. Click on that put your email in and you'll get weekly updates. Thank you all right, Cuban Happy! Thank you! Happy Thanksgiving to you too, cuban hi here Kevin here so I have a legislative update here regarding local law, 152 of 2016. So, according to local law, most buildings, including co-ops in school board district, are required to conduct a periodic inspection of gas piping system, beginning January, 1st 2020, so the buildings in CB1, 3 and 10 in all boroughs are supposed to complete the inspection by the end of the year. However, due to the Covid-19 safety guidelines and restrictions, there are many buildings we're not able to meet the deadline. So today, council member introduced a bill to extend the deadline for another six months, so we are working hard to try and get this passed by the end of the year, which is the original deadline, and we will keep the community updated on any public hearing states and, just briefly, just a remember, a reminder that we offer one-on-one virtual legal consultation. That's including immigration, housing issues. You may call us at 718-803-6373 or email on drum d-o-r-M-M console.nyc.gov. I'm going to put the information in the chat as well and last about the list. Council member, you know, wish everybody happy Thanksgiving. Please continue to stay safe and healthy, see you back in December. Thank you, Lisa Atkin Lisa, her mic is. This is Lisa right, her mic is not working, but she wanted me to share her message good evening, Community Board, three, where Mike is not working wishing each of you and your loved ones, the best possible holiday and thanksgiving, please be safe, get tested and protect yourselves. Free testing is available at Laguardia Terminal. Take advantage of this vital local service. Thank you, Lisa. Are you still on hi yeah? Sorry now? Oh, you wanted to say something who just talked wait before you go. Michelle did someone just say something? Yes, you said Chanel Hernandez from Aoc's office and Munoz from Senator Ramos's office, I, wasn't sure who you were addressing okay. So, let's see okay, you can go first since you're speaking and then let me see who else I'm missing go ahead. Okay! Thank you. Sorry, just very briefly: Senator Ramos's side, just an update for today the senator engaged in the New York Senate budget hearings for agencies among those were the environment conservation, where the senator spoke out against the energy power plans and advocated for sustainable infrastructure. Tomorrow, Friday November 20th 2020, thanks to the generous donations of union, Reps, Union sponsors and local health providers, we're going to be hosting a Thanksgiving turkey, giveaway in the courtyard of the Louis Armstrong Middle School, 3202, Junction Boulevard in east Elmhurst, and that's going to be at three o'clock, and that is all for me. Thank you and Michelle Hernandez hi everyone. This is Michelle Hernandez from the Office of Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez I have just a couple updates. So last week we hosted our monthly town hall and the congresswoman provided an update on what to expect from Congress. As we finish our first term, if you miss the town hall, you can find it on our Facebook page I will share a link shortly in the chat box and then for legislative updates. Congress is working on an omnibus spending bill to keep the government funded and that's going to end on December 11th, so they're working on passing that spending bill and then the last thing that I want to highlight- and we're very excited about this- is that tomorrow the congresswoman is expected to recognize on the floor. The centennial of the jewish center of Jackson Heights we're very excited to recognize their long history and service for jewish American Community and the wider Queens community and so I'll be circulating as well. In the chat link, a link to watching it live so the congresswoman will be providing a speech. It's a one minute speech that's allowed and it will be added on to the congressional record and we're wishing everyone a happy thanksgiving and we hope that you are able to enjoy. You know time with your loved ones, whether in person or remotely, and you can have a peaceful and restful holiday. Thank you. Anyone else did I miss anyone all right, so I think we're basically wrapping up. Vernetta I just like to comment on Aoc's representatives report very good: it's the 150th year. It's not the 100th year 150th year of the Jackson Heights Jewish Center, okay noted thank you. So we have no old business new business, so I call for a motion to end our I. Have some old business go ahead: Renetta all business, the BSA bureau of Standards and appeals? Okay, it's calling a meeting on December first, which will probably be a bad omen for us. They probably are going to approve the development of 114Th Street and Northern Boulevard, the former site of De Blasio Ford, which you got to scratch your head and wonder how these things happen because we had our council person Moya. We had our assembly person Gefron. We had our borough president acting Borough, President Lee and we had our fallen borough, President Katz, all saying no, but we lost it and it's a it's not a good time for obviously for the Dorian Miller people. It was an ideal location, perhaps for the school we've been clamoring for, but this particular developer is not interested in helping out the community. Well, thank you very much. Thank you ed and I, and definitely the information about the meetings will be circulated and those that can attend. Please attend so the more of us that are represented there at least we'll be there to say any additional comments. Sorry all right, I say call for a motion for our meeting to end at 10:04 p.m. Second, all in favor all right have a wonderful thanksgiving. Everyone be safe, social distance. Please be careful out there, you also be safe. We had a good meeting. Thank you all. Thank you, patience with the meeting. Thanksgiving, everybody what'd. You say it is. This is still there. Who can you send me a picture of that cake? Oh sure, I. Will lots of calories happy birthday, everybody! Thank you all right, Kevin! So we'll talk, okay, how you doing Marlene, okay, I'm good, very good, have a wonderful thanksgiving, I, hope, you're feeling better we're getting.
