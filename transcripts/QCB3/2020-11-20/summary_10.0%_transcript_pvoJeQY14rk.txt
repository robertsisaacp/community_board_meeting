Our meeting telephone number will not be published and we're going to possibly move from go to meeting to zoom, where it's going to give us a lot more control, I'm waiting for Miss Reed and for Keisha to come back in the room and for Clara, because they're contacting all of the speakers that I know we're not going to have members of the public on today, but we will be shut, we'll be publishing the meeting on YouTube and it will be accessible to the public.
Think I'm, going to let you open up with your presentation.
Some most of the members are on I, don't know if you want to show us yourself and I, just don't have a deck or anything like that.
So, one largely the city's concerned about the rising Covid-19 case numbers, but we do still believe we can fight back a second wave.
Yesterday we announced the closure of school buildings, which is a temporary closure as we're just trying to get a handle on these rising case numbers the schools that when we did open the schools earlier on, we had the gold standard of health and safety measures, including blended learning, socially distanced, classrooms, mandatory mask wearing widely available testing and a contact tracing program.
Getting out to families is that we need testing consent, forms to be brought back to schools and to be submitted.
The current closure is expected to last a minimum of two weeks, but we will be working with the state to figure out what the reopening will look like and with the upcoming holidays.
We are concerned that we're going to cross a threshold where the state will be dis, declaring New York City as an orange zone.
And, it's permitting store from businesses to use a portion of their sidewalk to display merchandise, sell goods, complete transactions and provide line-up areas, we're encouraging all New Yorkers to shop locally, this holiday season to support our small businesses and secondly, a more traditional initiative.
Time, there's also a similar education effort taking place around state laws which require all motor vehicle passengers to wear seat, belts, and so lastly, I just want to again emphasize the importance of continuing to practice all of our health and safety standards and to please get a Covid-19 test and have a happy and safe thanksgiving.
We then just ask families to monitor symptoms if a child is sick to stay home and to report if they have that positive Covid-19 test.
Okay, very good, this specific go-to meeting, so I'm just going to try to do this more quickly.
I was going to say anyway, so I just want to make clear that there are three components to the test and trace team.
And I think that's the important thing that we're trying to let everyone know that you don't need to have any symptoms to go, get tested.
You know we have heard of cases of people being asymptomatic and having tested positive, or.
We just want to make sure that everyone knows that our tracing team is out and about and making sure to contact everyone who has gotten a positive test and the reason and what the tracers will do is once someone does have.
And I will send out a full list of the testing sites every week, but the closest one to here you can just go on the website and look to see.
Will you know first for folks who don't who aren't able to quarantine or self-isolate, and the take care program will offer hotels, food delivery, medication, delivery, even pet walking pet services for those who will need to quarantine, and you can visit test and Trace.
We're, encouraging everyone to practice the core force of staying home if you're, sick, keeping your social distance and wearing a face mask as well as keeping your hands clean and getting tested more frequently, there has been some new holiday guidance that has been issued, that is on our test and Trace New, York, Health and hospitals, website.
You, know, basic Copio, 19 prevention through digital Outreach, social media, promoting the nearby testing sites.
We are starting to use more of the self-testing kits, so we want to be more flexible, especially with the long lines that are happening.
Since I know, Jessica already has pretty much stated, the other things that I was going to say.
I would be able to host a self-testing days or multiple of you still need this right.
Welcome to Queen's community board number three Jackson, Heights, Elmhurst and North Carolina.
What I'd like to do is first speak for about 10:12 minutes about some of the things going on and we're trying to do or 15 and then spend about 15 minutes on questions.
3 is such an important place in New York, it's the future and the idea to provide the ladders up in terms of services and opportunities, and everything else for the members of your constituency is vital.
Covid-19 and with all this happening, president Trump and the right-wing Republicans who occupy the Senate, don't want to do a damn.
We have the best lawyer, a guy named Mark Elias, he's going to court left and right to prevent trump from doing this and guess what he's won.
So let me go through a couple of things on Covid-19 relief, because I know that was a question that you had.
We want to expand the ppp, the money that went to the small businesses, the non-profits and the churches.
We want to make sure our schools get the money to open, safely.
You know no parent wants to send their kid to a school.
We want to provide a whole lot of money, so the schools can open safely.
You want to get on the phone and persuade people to vote and tell them that this will mean all these things which they matter to community board three.
I've worked very hard on climate change, but we'll make sure that climate helps average people of color, smaller communities.
We will get this bill passed, we'll do a big infrastructure bill and in that infrastructure bill we require that it's going to be 10 million new jobs, good, paying jobs.
It's a trillion dollars of infrastructure highways bridges, but also you know clean energy and all that people who are out of work, get trained for the jobs or have low paying jobs.
Okay, all right, so Megan a lot of issues I want to get out, we've covered them all in a short amount of time, and we thank you for what you're doing in Washington Megan.
I wanted to ask about what could be done with respect to the push to cancel student debt before January 20th and after January 20th, including with respect to the extension potential, push to convince Trump to ex push out the current relief past expiration at your okay, Megan.
We have petitions, I will get to your board our website and if you want to sign the petition and circulate it, I think we have two million signatures.
How come we're asking the students and the people who went to school to pay.
People come from many different walks of life, but basically we work very hard for what we have there's an issue here of the air.
I guess: I wanted to piggyback off of a couple of things you mentioned, and that Frank also asked about the food.
I know it's going to be politically difficult, but push hard to and make sure that our undocumented neighbors are included in the next Covid-19 relief bill.
They are included for food for rent and for the small you know the Ppp. The small business program lets the employer pay the employees, so they don't leave and because the employer doesn't have money and they don't check you, they don't ask your documentation.
Okay, very good, great people and I will get you both phone number email and a website and to how you can help correct yes, because we want you to be the majority leader.
We started a New York state D.O.T project to replace the Astoria Boulevard South Bridge over the ramp from the eastbound BQE that connects to the eastbound grand central parkway.
Okay, go ahead, I like to know what time will they be working on it because Northern Boulevard already has plenty traffic to be walking online during rush hour.
Everybody hear me: okay, yes, okay, great, so I'm here representing the office, would like to ask for the community board's approval for the streetcar naming of Dr Sergio Ivan Rubio way.
He was a good friend, often providing advice, encouragement and friendship to neighbors and young people who got a chance to work with him and learn from him.
And I just want to say thank you for the opportunity again to support this street.
Who's here to support I, know, there's a number of people that are not speaking right, now, but I.
He's always been a great role model, but I think he really defines something special for Jackson Heights as a really immigrant, a very diverse american community, where he really achieved an american dream and was able to show a lot of people and be a role model that you can achieve higher education and always strive for higher goals and make something great of yourself and so I.
Because I kind of like zoned out, okay, we did have other speakers, I didn't know.
Okay, right, you've been in the same location relatively in a food truck correct, which is like across the street.
I do actually have a question hi so once open will you continue to operate the food truck simultaneously at the same time as well as the restaurant, and the reason why I asked that is just thinking about the flow of your patrons who may go back and forth for anything that could potentially, you know, come up in that realm.
We were going to open up seven days, a week.
If we can possibly like have, you know, be permitted to have a full liquor license and trying to you know, have people come in, maybe have a drink or take.
We've been in good standing, so you know: I just asked the board to consider giving us the follicle license.
A question, though I just wanted to inform you that the the community board is starting a business acumen as far as the small businesses go and.
And I know the cases are going, up.
He just answered the question right, except for the fact that the liquor license submitted to the state is a different, name.
They reapply send in a new application that can actually have a hearing where they show up at your committee and then come here.
Our motion is committee, recommends approval of an application for a class change to an on-premises full liquor license for this applicant, provided the stipulation has been signed, stating the hours of operation will be 2 p.m, to 3:30 a.m. There will be two licensed security guards present at all.
I've heard that we're going to have to get tested once a month.
Arthur Tyler, any questions, all right: Miss Reed, District, manager's, report, Miss, Reed, yes, good evening.
So I just want to thank you for your continued cooperation and interest in supporting the community.
A very happy thanksgiving, I, look forward to seeing you all next month, I'd like to now call upon Laverne Nimmins, who will announce birthdays, Laverne, I'm, here, okay.
That's going to follow up on the open street discussion that was started and.
Our committee meeting, where we got a presentation from D.O.T and the only other thing I wanted to touch on from that meeting was there's.
Everyone I'm, going to keep it really, quick and short, just a reminder that we do have a Covid-19 test site at Laguardia, Airport.
I'll, say very fast: okay, the first one I'm going to put in the chat right.
That's some good news, even though our city is still in a lot of financial trouble, so check out that link for more information, there, the second thing and most important, thing, and I'm, hoping that all of you on this call can really help me.
So I'll put it there in case, there's other people who want to look at it, who aren't board members.
This is Lisa right, her mic is not working, but she wanted me to share her message: good evening, Community, Board, three, where Mike is not working.
They, probably are going to approve the development of 114Th Street and Northern Boulevard, the former site of De Blasio Ford, which you got to scratch your head and wonder how these things happen, because we had our council person.
Sorry all right, I say call for a motion for our meeting to end at 10:04 p.m. Everyone be safe, social distance.
