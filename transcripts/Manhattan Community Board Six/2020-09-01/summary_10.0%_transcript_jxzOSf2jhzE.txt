So now I'd like to introduce the community associate brendan birth and he will be on the call with us So I want to be clear about some of the information members of the public who may be on this call, I'm not sure I haven't seen your faces.
yeah, go to the second slide, all right, so this shows the the timeline for our capital projects and, as you can see, we're in the second column at this point with the community board 6 presentation, assuming that you guys like what we're proposing, we would then move on to the public design.
So, as steve mentioned at the end of february this year we held a community input meeting and we explained that the funds we initially had for the multi-purpose area were freed up for use in another part of the park.
We asked everyone to put stickers on the on the plan that we brought with us and, as you can see, these little round, dot stickers, sort of for the most part are within the playground and among the most common comments we heard at the meeting was a desire for a track that accommodated bikes and scooters, especially since the community expressed dismay over losing the large riding around space they had in the multi-purpose area.
The access to the multi-purpose area is difficult to get to and traverse, because you have to go over a playground, equipment and granite block some safety service, and because there are so many trees, there's really only one area that gets direct sunlight the right image shows a six foot perimeter fence around the park and unfortunately, we cannot be because it cannot be lowered their current funding, and these are the two entrances from first avenue.
Usually we I think we like to keep those those two activities separate just you know, because there is greater speed with skateboards, and you know there might be some type of injury that could be had, but I just also want to mention that the multi-purpose area that is now covered in asphalt there are plans to have that turfed over the synthetic turf.
There's a few up here by the multi-purpose area I do want to So there is a garden just to the the south along first avenue Will there be a similar safety requirement in this park?
and I own my apartment here at 330 third avenue, which is at the corner of 24th street and the original location of the rose hill, Okay, so I wanted to say something that I think is really important, given that we have all these budget cuts, given that the city is in bad shape, given that schools are going to open- Which is why I'm asking that you look at the pops and see if you see anything that might be suitable as a as a space for the kids, but I would ask that you function as if you had a third eye and the third eye is for the is for the community board and for the people who we represent on the community board so that we can do them a service and help them in whatever way is possible What you're talking about so I'd be happy to so a community board member asks the committee to address the topic.
