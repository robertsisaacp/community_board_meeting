If anybody's interested in the structural engineering, we could have a separate meeting about that, but that brought the park down from when I was working on this previously from over 200 million to about 100 million and depending on the ramps on the Manhattan and the queen side and connection to roosevelt island, we're looking at probably 150 million dollars and this is what it might look like now, just imagine from midtown Manhattan, you could take under a 10-minute walk and be roosevelt island or continue on and be in long island city.
A project like this from concept to approval is five to seven years on average, so the money is not really needed in any large numbers until about 2027, and if you take a look at when the city did its most planning, it was during the great depression when we were in worse financial shape than we are right now, one of the keys to the success of robert moses, getting things built, whether you're a fan of moses or not or somewhere in the middle on that was he had projects ready to go once whenever the money came D.O.T is constrained from even doing planning if money is not identified in the future.
It's important to think of all the funding sources and not feel like this is a hopeless moment, and we cannot think big and You know the touchdown point for the cars we want to be the touchdown point for the pedestrians and the bicyclists, and I wholeheartedly support the 48th street location.
Thank you, and did you have a question I do, but I'm not sure there were people ahead of me You know in east midtown, I honestly if it comes and I'd be happy to have a rezo I'd, be happy to support a reso in advance.
like the best time for planning is in the you know like in the darkest days, but honestly if it was if this was an item on a capital budget, and I was prioritizing it, I would be prioritizing the east side esplanade over this If we have money and it's a lot harder to get the developers to pay for that, and the un certainly isn't going to so so you know, I guess, I'm happy to support it, but just not if it, if there's kind of any chance of it being at the expense literally of the greenway.
Fine, okay, I guess the question was: would it substantially have to change the engineering and the cost behind this bridge if it was something like 26 to 30 feet, something along the lines of the walkway over the hudson, and I asked that not to debate the point, but just to say that you know we've seen nothing but terrible results from a lot of this mixed traffic stuff from bikes and pedestrians on stuff.
However, where the two intersect, I think, there's a opportunity to avoid conflict among pedestrians and bicycles by arranging for the bridge to approach Manhattan at a different level than the greenway, and that there would be a way to go from one to the other via ramps, and this would maybe even be elegant and attractive, as well as enabling people to remain safe by keeping them out of conflict with each other.
This is a show proposal and, as you hear today, people will offer many other solutions, but I think I would support a resolution for the concept and think it's important for new york city and its future bring up a good point about shovel ready and I was really disappointed, not in the obama administration, but in how new york city was not ready and a lot of the shovel ready that we did spend was just repaving streets that were in pretty good condition anyhow, because we weren't ready with any innovative designs, new streets, new bridges, new plans.
The coast guard has been frowning on movable bridges, but we have 25 in new york city, and I think it's certainly possible I'm really talking about is the concept that people want to paid attention if we didn't draw something up and try to get pictures in the media on it.
We're going to be discussing a possible resolution regarding school play streets in our district, including a specific proposal for east 56th street between second and third avenue, I'm not sure, john.
I do recall in the past that the local presence was very supportive of this and that they did work with the school to allow for closure it's actually not a question, but it's a clarification that definitely this is a request for a play street We thought we might write a resolution in support and just ask for expedited approval.
is that I think there's a pretty big city bike station on that block, and I don't know if that could be a problem of like kids, playing and people jumping on bikes, and I will not say anything and, as brian pointed out with regard to the earlier resolution, these are issues that are always going to be with us, but I don't think that those obstacles, no not a bit just a consideration.
and I always want you know, kids have the ability to you know have outdoor time and space, but, and I'm also just thinking about like the responsibilities of the department of education, what they should, probably you know be doing or advocating for on their side.
You know, like you know, every time a school wants to create a play street and shut down a street you know are or we are we thinking about this numbers of Covid-19?
I don't think it's an ideal condition to have the children playing in the street, so I actually had the opportunity to speak to matt about this resolution and it's really only meant to be a temporary solution while they where they can use it as staging and where their gymnasium is being used for other purposes.
I think hi, claire cb6 member matt bondy helped draft this resolution and interrupted us So matt asks why is that a restaurant can close traffic lanes with near immediate approval, but schools have to wait months for approval when children are at risk and need space to exercise and arrive and disburse safely from school.
I think what the resolution says is that you have 2 000 kids, that arrive every day and with you know, you know the number those numbers may be different now, but it should be a city-wide directive that you do whatever you can during these times to open these streets for these children, because you know we have no higher calling than to do this for them at this time.
, we're all aware that you know the opening of schools is a separate question which my committee will take up at its next meeting.
Okay, great moving on to the fourth agenda item here, a discussion on a possible resolution regarding the blockage of city streets by the new york city police department.
If we do put out, if we do consider a result on this, it should be a reso that says that we want these streets back open to the public, because we don't see anything happening right now.
We really want the use of the street, so I'd like to call the question in a reso that just asked the NYPD to open these streets again for the community.
You all have to excuse me first time doing this, but now we are going to continue our discussion of the resolution that requested that dot assess converting some commercial metered parking spaces to general metered parking in community district, six and and andrew worked on this resolution.
That, indeed, you know there is a very high demand for the commercial parking and that there's you know no room for changing signage, then so be it leave it, but we're again I also just want to add as an aside, while I'm speaking for a second thanks to colleen You'll note that just one thing I'll note is that you know this is very much in context with a resolution that we had passed just five months ago, sort of asking for a broader look at how herbs curbsides are used.
Larry raises an interesting point there, because we really are stretched with what we can do and again with the resources that we have right now, because we're prioritizing we're trying to prioritize a lot of the safety projects that we have presented to the community boards, and there have been some cutbacks that you know we have to deal with I don't think this is going to be a priority for us at the moment, but not to say the least, that the community board should not put this in writing and send a resolution to dot asking us to take a look at this.
and again our I know, our bike team is working on a you know, permanent solution that they can share with the community board and when we do have something togeth put together and I'll ask them what the timeline is with that and then we're looking about the status of the 38th and 39th street So I would imagine, sometime in september, I think we sent out the what's happening here: flyer to the community board brendan sandy.
it may she noted it may take a while, yes, because it spans three community boards right So what I know for sure is that open street We have a few questions from our committee members, so larry.
You know, personally, I think it's needed and for a lot of reasons, but I think the challenge is in my question: you colleen is there some way or could we put up a resolution to help that tries to standardize or asks for dot to maybe think of creative solutions to improve the safety, or at least the standardization of the outdoor dining?
