Thanks, kyle nice to see everybody and I hope- everybody's safe and healthy and doing well even still during a pandemic in a quite a difficult time here in the city and thank you guys for all you're doing to stay connected and keep helping our community at a time where it's so necessary and we just need to kind of continue to be able to see each other talk to each other and work on some of these important challenges before the city.
They still have to do a lot of work and we have seen- and I think there are some really good and important issues at the federal level at the state level.
That we think are actionable, need attention and try to highlight them and also try to point the direction in for the city council members and for state legislatures or some of the items that their businesses and those who represent them are asking for and in the council.
But we have to do a lot more and so I'll just go through with a few items that we had highlighted that we think are items that we could sort of do we should be starting to plan for one is this the city I mean this is number one item is rent and being able to pay rent right now, and there are of course, plenty of bills in the council yield other issues around small businesses.
I'm hopeful the federal government will step in and do another version or extend the terms of the ppp program, which I think was actually pretty powerful and helpful to these small businesses.
So what I am saying is in whatever version of aid we get indirectly someone's gonna have to go to a plug holes in our social safety net in our budget, but we have to set aside some portion of money to be able to put out together a program to help either do grants low interest loans, maybe convertible to grants or some version of both to make sure we can help these businesses get through the next few months, even if you're, just a restaurant, you're doing outdoor dining, you can't have indoor capacity when you do.
Maybe I think we should start with businesses that found themselves ineligible for federal assistance and also businesses that are long likely going to be opening at a much later phase here.
I mean that's, not that's a hard one because of resources, but it's the most obvious one number two is we introduced a bill into this into the city council on tuesday, with margaret chin and gail brewer, which attacks the commercial rent tax, which is you guys, probably know this?
So what we said is we're not doing a full repeal of it for the long term raises a lot of money for the city, but during covid, let's not ask these businesses to pay it anymore.
That's a really important one and we've talked about some other ways to help workers out who have been left out of this economy or are sort of struggling right now as well, but the just I'll just we'll send you the report around as well, but this is a good time for us all to be thinking about strategies to help them to give them a few more months of revenue at times where it's going to be really hard, we also call for expanding the provisions around takeout and delivery.
Yesterday, we did a small business petition to support outdoor dining, so we're trying to take some steps in the days ahead to actually lean into some of the ideas around it, and we are looking for ideas because we're always looking for more good ideas, but how to help these folks.
We've already gotten collected more ideas from some folks about things we can do, but this is a really tough moment in new york, and I just want to make sure that our especially our neighborhood, like restaurants and small businesses, know that we are trying to help them.
We are trying to give them ways out, and I just the last thing I say is it's in our report, but I know you're going to talk about is the business insurance interruption.
We actually have a couple of questions that wouldn't mind answering them, so I think kevin raised his hand.
There are we have seen early on and some of the folks, even skytown were sending me examples of where they were going into stores and seeing marked up prices for lysol wipes and spread, and you know disinfectant and other items that were kind of co-ventilated.
I see john keller holding up his masks and there was a real issue out there where people you know, had supply or had access and were hiking those items up and I think the price gouging law that was put in effect around clovid was predominantly focused on that stuff.
I also would be interested in looking at some furthering of the price gauging laws here in the city, particularly around state of emergencies, and maybe looking for ways to either actually solidify, though the things that, like better having to have to pass an executive order on that actually putting that into our law and I'll just mention that you know some years ago when, when surge pricing started on uber, which is one of the third-party apps too, I found that actually, there were a number instances when I remember it was a super bowl night.
Okay, thank you, yeah and I just wanted to add kyle, because kevin had raised it.
You order some seamless or maybe you're one and use it on both, but if you are both like, maybe you know you rely on it, but but we did find restaurants all have different arrangements and different agreements, and some were paying a lot of money over these third-party services.
I do think we should make sure that some of that money goes to the delivery people, if I'm paying for like a delivery free on those apps.
You know weather when it's a bad weather and other things and have been really kind of doing a lot to feed us and to get us the food so and I think we should extend it.
I also think we should be looking at whether there's anything around you know I'm helping the people that are actually delivering it as well, but anyway, that's what we're talking about I'll go to the next question.
The mayor's office is the council kind of behind it, and it's really about getting the mayor's office on board and are there local organizations that you think would be valuable for those on the committee who have connected to mobilize yeah.
It's, I think it's kind of shameful and I'm glad that new york is stepping in, but you know we shouldn't have to provide for like we're relying private philanthropy to fill in a gap.
It's great question, so the couple things I think it's really important- and I was speaking to the former sps creation about this- that there's some way to help pay the rent and albany has a number of bills on it.
Even just passing resolutions saying, like you know, rent is due tomorrow, two days from now, for these guys and it'll be due september, 1st and october 1st and we'll keep going, you know having some version of rem relief and I don't subscribe that it all has to be grants that don't have to ever get paid back like we could do some low interest loans that, like for certain size, businesses that will help them and they can pay back over a long time in a long period of time, but we didn't need something.
Don't make us shut down our kitchen in the middle of the day so that we are losing all that business for a half an hour an hour or something like that so, but I would say, like look all voices really help here, because what I've learned in the pandemic and outdoor dining was a big part of it like I said something about it early and then, like I know, catherine rivera captain, reynoso, gail brewer everybody just started like jumping in and in this moment, like there's nobody's, got a plan.
I've talked to the commissioner moya in the city about maybe trying to drive some like donors to this, because it's a private thing, but but the book, the mayor's gonna, be the biggest impediment here, because he's gonna be do the right thing, which is to worry about the cost of it, but also I found that we just need a lot of pushing from the council and outside people to get him to do the things we want them to do on almost any issue.
I think that I think there's like a lot of issues out there right now, and this is the one that would help the most and I think the insurance companies industry is just at least the minimum saying give us the money to so we don't collapse if that's the case, but so I, but I you know, I'm not sure I would be more than willing to work with anybody who wants to do some lobbying around it.
How are you hey just a quick comment- and I think this has been socialized by this committee before and I'm sorry, if you've already heard of it, but I think in addition to going back to the points around the caps around the platforms, you know one thing that we've seen happen: that's been surfaced to.
Some of these issues and you're, like I think what you're identifying is like at this point in time you probably want to work.
Actually, I was I'm doing a lot around independent music venues too, and trying to save them, and I talked to one owner who kind of has a couple bars and venues, and he said that, like one negotiated, one, they kind of came to some terms on how to pay and the others he's got to know.
You know desanitation, whether it's pickup or street cleanings, or things like that yeah.
No, you know I was hoping the pandemic would solve at least one problem which is rats in new york city, as they had lost lots of options of food here, but we didn't get that so I'll start by saying, like this program, was stood up in very short order.
I think one of the things we can do if you make it permanent, is to come up with even some plan about how you have to build the outdoor or come up with some specs or something like that helps address some sanitation.
This was a program I think they had applications open on friday by monday, people were open, so there was purposely not a lot of thought put on it, because we wanted to get these guys open and put money into their pockets.
I wanted to let you know how wonderful I think it is to see the restaurants coming back to life and how beautiful some of the streets look with the string lights and the tents and the way that they've done it up with planters and everything else.
One thing that I came across here the other day that I think that everybody should be mindful of going forward is, was one place and I don't want to necessarily name them, because I'm not out to do that to anybody.
It looks pretty good and it's nice to see it going down so yeah point us to any examples where there might be a real problem and as we do the long-term stuff, we got to think about how to make this like really part of our streets, not just like sort of an add-in and add on.
I think we have like 500 signatures already yeah, so we're going to you know we're going to collect a petition and send it over to our to our colleagues.
We go in support of the small business and outdoor dining program, including the recommendations in keith's reports all right before.
So for things like outdoor dining, if we have issues with you know- sanitation of course, or even ideas on as the council member just mentioned.
You know sanitation going through, and I lost my train of thought, the other on the other, oh about coming through pedestrian traffic, that they find that they should start looking for ways to organize pedestrian traffic for pedestrian flow without making a specific recommendation.
Yeah, we don't have to you, know, put forth a specific plan within this resolution on any of that, we could just say that you know we want to maintain pedestrian safety and space as well as sanitation standards and public health standards, and something like that: okay, good, because they do yeah because they do go hand in hand right, because if we do make it permanent, we also it needs to be accompanied by some kind of plan.
And I don't think that as much as I you know, support small business, and everybody knows that I do that there should ever come a time when the interests of outdoor dining trump, the interests of socially distancing, kids and giving them a place to play.
Are there any other comments on this, because I you know, I think matt brings up a great point, which is obviously we want to make sure that we're supporting the small businesses, but as we as the work is always included.
Second, all right, kyle, your vote, yep, I'm in favor of supporting council member powers, economic plan, okay, matt in favor genie, favor paige, I'm in favor, john in favor, anton favor kevin in favor seema.
So, moving on to the next agenda item brendan, could you pull up the legislation so we'll be discussing what actually the council member mentioned about the business interruption insurance?
Let's start with the assembly and just review that quickly and then go to the senate one, and then we can open up for discussion, because I want to make sure that public members have a chance to view it as well yeah.
Actually you know we can call in the state, senator's office and the assembly member's office to see if someone can walk us through what their thinking is, where it is in the process as well.
Is this co-sponsored by any of our cb6 assembly members or senators like harvey or dan or is it would be the logical people to go to right yeah?
Yes, it looked like epstein was one of the sponsors of the assembly version but ordered, or you know either one I'll go back to it so that we can double check rebecca, see, right, she's, epstein's there, he wright is there yeah, I don't see.
I think there was a distinction that the council member mentioned, that there was an earlier version that was asking for this to cover prior to the actual shuttle- I guess back in march and the early days, but that there is an amendment to make it going forward, but I think, with the presentation next month we can better clarify what they're thinking and how they've edited the bill since it's been in committee for so long, okay, seema.
It's still bizarre to me that we, in the you know, 2020 just throw bags of garbage on the sides of street and it hasn't evolved from that, but I think this is a good time to do something immediate to address the concerns that we're seeing, because I think this also impacts how people feel about outdoor dining.
Things like pick up and again wanted to open it up to conversation to see if there are any interesting ideas people have as to how this could be addressed in the immediate future.
It's like a movement, so I think if people are, you know we lost.
You know so my two questions is like: why is it so much trash and I think the restaurants are going to push back and say: hey, that's not our trash.
I think, if they kind of if they can get that going again, that's a huge, that's a huge plus in so many different in so many different directions exactly you know, and it's like we're forgetting about what's happening with climate change, and you know so we're throwing out this whole composting program to save some money.
I think that would actually engage local people as well like there might be community members on their block, who would say hey for the business.
I think with the reopening it's just kind of motivated people to say: hey, you know what I want to spend more time outdoors.
I want to support my local businesses and so they're, seeing you know, increases in that, but then, of course that creates trash.
I think there needs to be some owners on the businesses themselves as to how they're you know, collecting trash and when they're putting it outside and how long they're leaving it outside for, but that's again open to discussion, how you know how we would like to because again, you know, as I always say like I like to be proactive, so I want you know any potential resolution.
You know sanitation measures, but right now, I'm just thinking about immediate things, because I've received a lot of complaints about it.
As far as the city is concerned, it's a budget problem and you know I've seen people are using these corner garbage cans, but if they're not being emptied in a timely manner, well, they just get piled up and piled up.
Do you have any ideas on what that could look like just initially, I really don't, but you know there are smarter people in the sanitation department or in this business, who probably can come up with ideas.
So, of course you know we should be thinking about budget requests going forward, obviously we're in a budget deficit.
It's primarily been on affordable research, space and inc business incubators for the district, which is you know, has worked in some cases hasn't, but I really think this is time for us to be more substantial in what requesting, because, as we've seen from our workload, a lot of the you know future development and future ideas are landing on our laps as the business affairs committee and supporting small businesses, but also community development at the same time.
So I wanted to open it up to, and this is obviously the first of many conversations, but I do want us to start thinking about it, because the budget committee is going to be discussing this as well.
And, of course, every other committee has a bunch of priorities as well, but I want us to start thinking about things that we could request or modify as we move forward with.
This also affects our district needs as we go forward and, of course, that's going to be very comprehensive going forward because there are a lot of needs going on right now, but I wanted to open up the discussion to see what kind of things that people are thinking about, things that we want to see in the district or maybe changes to agencies, priorities or anything else.
So jeannie, I see your hand up if you want to start off the conversation yeah thanks kyle, I was thinking of a small allocation to maybe work with the bids on a needs assessment.
So just you know, I can start off with some ideas, some of the things that I've been most interested in and obviously I think this is exacerbated going forward, but I've always been interested in like workforce readiness, making sure that people are prepared for the workforce that businesses are prepared for you know whatever it is, that's coming their way.
So really, as I was thinking about, you know, future budget requests and of course this is not a fully formed idea, but really thinking about like entrepreneurs support so like really supporting small businesses.
I think you know if you saw the commercial rent control resolution, that we passed a couple of years back, that I sent to everybody via email, one of the big things that needs to be done at the city level.
So I don't know if anyone, if that kind of has you know, motivated someone else to think about something, but or if people as they've, you know been preparing for this meeting, have come up with other ideas or just have a gut reaction in this moment to some things that we could put on this budget list any initial thoughts or ideas.
I wouldn't kind of produce that the funds in any sort of timely fashion for sure if they were even going to fund it right, I'm not sure what the city agency would help fund that, but that is certainly like a good idea, for you know you all of you agreed to that, could pitch it to the broader membership or to the executive committee about using the budget funds that we have for the office or street fair funds if it's outside of what we could pay for on the office level.
This may seem, I don't know, sort of minor or maybe obvious, but I think a lot of small businesses- and this gets at some of the issues that have come in front of this committee have struggled with just the basic cost of ppe and other things.
Is you know I don't want people to think that an idea is too small or too big.
I think another idea could be something like I mean you know just pulling off our previous conversation, something on sanitation.
And then you know we can get more information about what specifically that looks like because then the budget committee then puts the district needs together, and all of that, so I want to make sure that we're providing the best and most information, but I also want to use this as an opportunity.
Like you know again, the city is going through transition and obviously our local neighborhoods is our as well, and I think you know a lot of conversations when it comes to reform, or you know, big changes that we need to see often start at the budget level, and so even I think another way to think about these budget requests too, is even if it doesn't, you know, get fulfilled.
We are the only committee right now, I think that's meeting through the summer and obviously the issues that we are facing right now and discussing are very important to not only our neighborhood but through the city as a whole, not just for now, but for years to come.
