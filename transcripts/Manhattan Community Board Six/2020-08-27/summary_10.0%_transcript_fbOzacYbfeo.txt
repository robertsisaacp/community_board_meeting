I want to thank the assembly, member and his staff for joining us today and for giving us time to discuss a very important issue.
We don't really know the numbers right, so how many folks fall into these categories, one who groups of small businesses or businesses that have the insurance the pandemic laws in it, others that don't so How many just in community board sex are affected, that they just can't get their insurance because of this hidden clause and whether or not businesses know that there's some legislation going, you know into albany about this and whether my other, my only other question, is whether or not the media knows about this.
The bill would also prohibit landlords from imposing late fees, interest or other penalties uncovered tenants during the coven 19 state of emergency and imposes a blanket moratorium on eviction proceedings for covered tenants for the non-payment of rent through at least 30 days following the expiration of the covid 19 state of emergency, and you know the question is: why is it important and urgent to take action on commercial rent relief now Over you know, 3 000 small businesses have permanently closed and that number's much higher I'm sure at this stage, since the pandemic began and without some kind of intervention that number's only gonna, you know continue to climb the number one reason these businesses are shutting down You know insurance coverage that basically doesn't work because of non-physical damage of a virus, even when they do have pandemic insurance.
The second is heavy sport entrepreneurs, so we can fill a lot of those commercial vacancies that are were already quite prominent before this pandemic and now have really become quite a rash, and, lastly, is how do we invest in local neighborhoods, with the kind of sentiment that now it's one thing to say is shop local, but if people can't access their commercial corridors, if they can't spend time there for various reasons, because of accessibility issues for transportation issues, they can't shop local.
People can spend time there and get commercial floors and then repurposing street space for restaurants, which we're doing now, but also for retail and other community uses making use of our street space so that we can help businesses right now We've had some success in pushing for, as I said, legal assistance for businesses, we're gonna, negotiate discussion about opening street space for some retail we've been talking with the bid association.
like I said right on the southern border of your community district, is on the north side of 14th street between second and third We are happy to answer any questions that you have, but we really do hope that we can have your support tonight so that this important business can continue.
You know they're part of the family and, as you've heard from all the conversations we've had earlier tonight about making sure that business owners, small and then larger as well, are getting the protection and support that they need and actually I'm familiar with, the bar This process is obviously we want to support businesses.
These questions is to make sure you know that we're thinking about these things and that you know we don't get to a situation where people are calling 3-1-1 and all of that, because we want to make sure that you know that this is a great place for a business to thrive and, at the same time, a great place to live.
We want to make sure that you know there are signs encouraging people to be respectful of their neighbors, whether it's you know smoking or sanitation, or you know, noise of course, and also that there's a number that the residents can reach for someone who's on site in case they do have complaints so that they're calling you directly instead of calling you know the police or 301, because often times what we see is if there was just communication between the establishment and the residents, that thing would have been done in a couple of seconds instead of escalating.
A lot of customers would come over from first avenue and would come over to second avenue, which was fantastic, but on friday and saturday night it wouldn't come because of all these wild bars around the pla that were around the neighborhood and we found out was a battle, but so because you know, we want to make sure again that any community issues are dealt with between the establishment and the you know, and the neighbor before you know escalating into something that it does not need to escalate to.
We already have the restaurant row- east alliance, who has been doing a lot of great work for the community too, and making sure that things are organized and noiseless, and you know social distancing and all of that, so seeing no more questions or comments from the committee or the public.
In fact, even some old community board members who sent me videos pictures- and so we reached out to the owner of barcogi, who one week ago, said that they were going to abide by the requests that I made to make sure that they were compliant with everything, particularly with the social distancing, which is obviously of most concern is the public health, and so they said that they were going to implement that We have reached out to them and actually asked for very actionable and specific things for them to do to alleviate the situation so moving on to or actually something that I just heard about today, we will be continuing our partnership with community board eight.
So I do want us to be proactive on this and coming together with some ideas or even just coming together to you know, light a fire under the city to make sure that they are thinking about this proactively and are putting something together that is actionable and also, at the same time minding public health.
We're not writing the bills, we're not doing you know the actual work of it all, but it is expressing what our needs are as committee as community members as residents and as you know, concerned citizens, and that you know the things that we bring up should be taken into their equation and into their processes dan and I support the description that dan just described and then also I just wanted to it's putting you on the spot, but you know, do you know any other community boards that have already like put a template together for a resolution, so I don't know that anyone is really thinking about it, but that's true of a lot of things that we've done.
I think we're still the first, and only can you work cody correct me if I'm wrong, that was, you know ahead of commercial rent control like over two years ago no one has taken into consideration public health risks.
