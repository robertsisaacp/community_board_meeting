So, at the point before the pandemic hit, you know we were moving ahead with the approvals on the property on 13th street to get that going and we were going to start building on 13th street and we had not yet come to a concrete plan of what we were going to do with the property, so the pandemic hits and obviously everything gets put on hold and we continue to still be on hold because right now we have to be prepared for a possible second wave and we're required by the governor to have plans to go to a 50 percent up to a hundred percent surge, and some of that's been done by using you know, space at the petri division.
Oh, it's not in the process of being emptied out, but the services that are in the bernstein building the construction for the new facility have very preliminarily started, we're still years away from that finishing as well, but that's the only project of our what we originally talked about for what was going on the super block and , that's actually been picked up, nothing's being done on 13th street as we speak.
I know you don't have a lot of new things to tell us, but any idea when you would be meeting on all of that again or are you just waiting for the word from the governor in terms of when I would say right now, given the fact that we are, we are surge planning for the potential for the fall, that I can't imagine that the real estate committee and the real estate group are sitting there anytime before you know middle to end of october, when we see what's going on I know that the borough president's working group, which you guys are parts of you are associated with that.
Okay, so I may be able to tell you, sometime later this month, at least what we're thinking about, but right now, clearly, everything is on hold with the timeline of everything of the construction being pushed back a minimum of six months, because obviously this is new york.
You know, I think, what I reported, or we reported the last time, is the real estate committee was kind of sitting down and trying to figure all this out Yet, and obviously, as I said, I I'm not a real estate expert, but the real estate market in new york city has clearly changed due to this pandemic.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen at this point, given all that I know we haven't met formally as a full working group over the summer, but some of a few of us have been meeting and reviewing and kind of working on a website, and we can show the whole committee We just want to highlight what we think is on the chopping block or for sale at this point.
We took some photos of the area we have on the site where people can kind of orient themselves I think it's a good stepping off point to do some outreach to community groups and then the next step being that we do want to see if we can maybe engage a meeting of some sort with the larger community and different input , so we're okay to go ahead and reach out to those to friends school and what have you It talks about the fourth coming sale, listing that it's going to happen in 2023 what they need to potentially get out of it, and then it talks a little bit about the relocation to rivington street, and on that page I think we're going to kind of maybe tweak the language that says it's the largest real estate sale.
