Following, the presentation, the community members will have an opportunity to ask questions and, after the committee members have asked their questions, We will open the floor to the public hearing to in order for comments and questions on this proposal.
I, also want to thank many of you who have been part of this work in the years since Hurricane Sandy Zoning for coastal flood resiliency poses updates to the zoning resolutions.
Four and other related sections I will be sharing my screen with the presentation, so we're going to go through a brief overview of what is a very detailed text: zoning amendment that improves upon the existing flood text that and makes it permanent.
I also want to point out that, While this map is zoomed into Manhattan for the purpose of this presentation and a lot of the references I'll be making will be in reference to Cv6, This amendment is a city-wide text.
We have tried our best to focus primarily on the provisions applicable to CB6 in this presentation, but since the text has a city-wide application and the board is asked to comment on the totality of the text, this presentation might show some building typologies that are not typical of Manhattan, like single family detached homes.
The zoning resolution is an added layer that is meant to accommodate these regulations, while also improving neighborhoods, So the two work together, but the requirements for how the buildings are made resilient lie within the New York City, Building Code.
Floodproofing means meeting specific design and materials requirements so that water can not enter the building during a flood.
Building these building code regulations became widely applicable soon after the storm, but posed conflicts with the zoning resolution in three main ways: rules that regulate where certain uses shall be located: block, regulations that govern the size and shape of buildings and how buildings interface for the public, realm.
It is meant to build on the previous two zoning text, amendments that were put in place shortly after Hurricane Sandy and remove barriers within the zoning resolution that make it hard for new and existing buildings in the floodplain to meet the building code.
Two text amendments that the city adopted Post Sandy on an emergency basis, helped address these issues.
This work, we gathered insights from stakeholders and partner city agencies, which helped us uncover additional zoning barriers to resilient construction.
Our goal was twofolds, one to educate the community on flood risk and the range of regulations that are required and available to them in the flood zone and two learn from residents and the technical community how they envision the buildings where they live, work or help design being more resilient.
However, They were not enough in assisting residents, relocate all living spaces above the DFE or over elevate the lowest floor above future, flood levels attached homes in multi-family, home buildings, such as the ones within the CB6 floodplain, were not sufficiently addressed.
Use of book regulations did not get enough relief to make buildings more resilient rules that gave additional height and allowed certain spaces to be exempted from floor area varied by the flood level, leading to unintended and inequitable outcomes such as resilient buildings being built out of scale for the neighborhood or loopholes within the text that allowed developers to make buildings bigger, but not necessarily resilient.
Now, I will briefly go through the proposal to describe how coastal, as only for coastal flood resiliency, addresses these issues while encouraging the city's buildings to be more resilient.
The floodplain community wants to be able to prepare buildings for flooding, even if they're not located in FEMA, currently determines to be the highest risk.
Two people also want the option to raise living spaces higher than the current flood level defeatment projects, because they have seen higher flood levels already and expect that risk to grow in the future, with sea level rising and therefore the expected fall level in the storm in the event of a storm residents and business owners want to be able to invest in resiliency incrementally so it's more affordable over time.
They want options like moving their mechanical equipment to a higher elevation, without necessarily triggering a requirement to raise or fully flood proof the structure.
Optional rules for how height is measured in the floodplain would allow building owners to physically elevate habitable spaces and other building support features above expected, flood elevations, so they are safe in the long term.
This would also require that the flood flow that the floor level is placed at or above this reference plane to ensure that additional building height is tied to actual resiliency improvements, and it will close a loophole that currently exists for developers to get additional height without making the building resilient to help promote safer buildings, The good long-term, resilient design and good neighborhood streetscape.
The proposal would allow existing floor area exemptions for spaces that are wet floodproved to apply to both existing and new buildings.
This would help encourage active uses close to the street and sidewalk and promote a safe and lively pedestrian environment, while making sure that the resulted buildings are not out of scale.
They will help building owners to undertake incremental steps toward resiliency without requiring the structure or sites to fully meet Appendix G, which is cost prohibitive.
Many of these buildings can not be completely elevated or dry flood proof due to cost or operational needs, but many of these business owners would like to raise priority spaces and equipment above harm's way, so they can minimize business disruption in case of a storm.
The proposal will therefore allow power systems, including generation generators and solar energy systems, to be considered a permitted obstruction in open areas across all zoning districts to facilitate their installment.
This is not necessarily the biggest issue, but as you're I know, There is some talk about integrating Csos and like how those are going to be reformed and I.
And I mean Csos are like we're talking, today, I know about issues that are, Hopefully you know, hundred-year, floods, 50-year floods.
But you know, Csos are an everyday problem, and so I would like to think that the reforms that were being made for land use are being integrated with what DEP is doing to try and improve Cso issues.
This text, particularly, is has to do with because of the technicality of it being related directly to the city's building code and those building codes based on the floodplain maps created by on a federal level by FEMA, It's limited in that where it can be applied, all right.
You know: we've got the East Coast resiliency project, just building the flood wall.
That mean that the maps will change and we actually will not need this particular zoning amendment because we no longer are in the floodplain majority of CB6.
That also applies to what we're likely to find be defined very soon as the future one percent floodplain, but there may not be as much incentive for older buildings to retrofit because of the East Coast resiliency project.
Having said that, It would only apply to where Eska has actually been able to being able to provide some benefit which largely in CB6, yes, is behind the Diesca wall, but you know, obviously, the rest of the city also benefits from this text.
There, are close to a million residents in New, York City and retreat a retreat option for every single neighborhood or every single coastline, wouldn't necessarily be the most efficient way of handling coastline, especially if we're having these different projects and resiliency efforts like Esker, and this zoning amendment.
And, then I think we're then going to open up to the public hearing site all right.
So this text, particularly added under goal three, the ability to incrementally too resilient for it, because that was one of the things that previously did not exist and is causing a lot of cost prohibitive issues for buildings.
You know if they wanted to just relocate their mechanical equipment that was triggering within the building code that they had to then kind of you know conform to all of Appendix G, So the zoning code, this zoning amendment is actually allowing more of an incremental increase so that it would allow them to, You, know retrofit at in a more planned and long-term way, rather than requiring that right, away, every single building must be retrofitted to resiliency.
Both, quick, one of them is building on Kyle's question, which was one of my original questions, which is there are issues around the city with people wanting to build super talls and they are kind of abusing the use of mechanical spaces to make buildings.
So, it's this incremental retrofits that the text is allowing for is, you know, limited in what it is permitting, so it has to do with mechanical equipment or it has to do with support spaces and flood protection.
A lot of this stuff already exists in the building code, but the zoning was kind of creating a hindrance in applying them, rather than you know, allowing them.
Here is really trying to make sure that we're you know incentivizing private owners to actually engage in improving their properties to increase resiliency, so they can lower insurance.
The city did actually address that in R9 and R10 and equivalent commercial districts a year or so ago, through other mechanical voids text amendment and what that did is in those zoning districts it introduced and.
Sorry mechanical space before they are considered floor, area, so that threshold with this text, amendment still exists.
It's, relocating existing planet equipment to other spaces within the building, or something in some instances safer in the instance of skytown, in other places, on the site if the owner chose to, and that allows it to be considered if it's on the site as a permitted obstruction, so that wasn't previously available to many sites because they had to you know.
So to answer your question, in short, the thresholds of what is considered a mechanical void, which our text amendment addressed last year, will not change because of this great.
I mean we should certainly clarify that none of these rules are intended to be affecting the public right-of-way, be it sidewalks or streets or parks or open spaces or anything.
If not, can text amendments be used as basis to create legislation or other revenue funding to help buildings pay for these improvements at a time when, right, now, business, tenancy commercial income is going down and cost rents are increasing, so.
Actually, You know make back what they have spent on, say: dry, flood proofing by capturing floor areas somewhere else that the zoning resolution is not a place that we can start building in specific financial incentives.
However, I also want to emphasize again that any private property owner who will be using this text to you know to use that mechanical permitted obstruction aspect of it.
And I mean, if that's the case in the department of buildings would be having a look at their request for permits, and you know coming to the conclusion that this is unnecessarily unnecessary.
If you have a current capacity for a building or multiple buildings and you're building additional capacity, potentially creating additional environmental impact, I, don't see that as something that DOB would as normal course of business actually be in the process of evaluating and I would agree with what Ann said it seems like this is kind of more in the zoning text.
Know, Consider any comments you had on how that could be actually regulated, because I think that's something.
I mean whether it actually addresses what the question was of whether they can build a Chp plant on this side.
You know on this presentation on this particular zoning amendment, So I opened to the floor of the committee to discuss different ideas of a resolution that we would like to shape.
I mean I, think you know, we've had several people speak to it.
I just wanted to second what Sandra said, because I think that Anne raised an excellent point about unintended consequences.
A resolution, Okay, I would agree and if I could just I think we need to address in some way the East Coast resiliency project and how that is going to impact us and potentially do we need.
You, know we're going to follow the zoning amendment in the future.
Alongside, Okay, I think that's a great idea, and so I guess, with that said, you know, do I.
Everyone, actually I'm going to introduce one of our colleagues and wanted to take this moment to thank my team, but also make sure that everybody on this board and meeting is familiar with our team members.
First, one was the community advisory that announced the work beginning in the Pa2 project, area, around astrolevy playground and in the solar one facility, so community advisories will be issued as needed depending on the work that's going on for the project, so milestone activities or certain shutoffs, etc will be kind of blasted through a community advisory, the Ccl in any project again for us, it's Nadine on Board, so she will be kind of handing them out on site at certain points.
They were putting up fencing to close the park, keeping open the track and handbook courts as stated, and then the next area will be solar, One we're still working out the details on where that fencing is going to be with our contractor.
We had a walkthrough with parks, so I guess a week and a half ago, then solar, one area where we're going to build the flood.
There we're working out that when this, when solar one closes the bikeway, we'll be rerouting the greenway signs for the bike bikes coming from the north and south Submittal reviews, we're doing test bits for utilities and then some demolition activities in the park because it gets all new amenities and that'll continue into December.
This is just we've seen this slide before I think, but this is just the idea of having phase construction so we're allowing access to Esther Libby Park in 2020, Stuyvesant cove in 2021, and then Murphy brothers playground in 2022, so that we don't close all the parks at the same time and Stuyvesant Cove park itself is going to be phased half at a time.
And I think a way to potentially avoid issues like that is, If you could potentially resign even redesign the email, maybe bullet out some things on nature, where you explicitly say, what's going to be open, If, possible.
Exactly I, don't have an exact time frame because you know I think the lawyers have to talk to each other to to address just having access around the building.
I mean we are working with our contractor to allow them to gain access to the solar one area at which point they want to close it off, and then that would close.
I mean we have to get access to the site, and then we have to make a determination on for Glo. But you know: Are we going to allow pedestrians to pass through there safely so that they can still access the waterfront down the East side.
So in terms of the coordination with ESCR, and just to ensure that we wanted to make sure that we present that at the transportation committee, that's a little bit separate from the detour.
So, just to add on to what Neg had just mentioned, gene I know that I had reached out to Cody about presenting and confirming our presentation on the Avenue C project for the upcoming Tc Meeting Transportation committee meeting on December 7th I just want to further clarify and underscore next points that we're.
You know a project that will help provide additional detour options during ESCR construction, and so this is our perma proposal for a permanent expansion of the bike Lane network in this area, and so we're hoping to get your feedback on that.
The second thing that you didn't address that we heard both from members of the community and from board members were about security issues and safety issues and again I looked at the minutes from last month, and you know it was one of the things that you said.
Other question is about security issues in the areas where you're doing this sure thanks Ann for the you know for just to speak to again the rerouting of the cyclists and pedestrians.
Did you know a great job of kind of responding to that in the last question, and that is something that we are working with.
And, you know, NYPD, to make sure that those spaces are safe, And I think that's something that we're going to need to address as we ramp up.
I attended the meeting of Community Board 3 transportation committee when I brought up the issue of where were you going to bring the bicycles with respect to the construction north of 14th street.
I just want to go back to Larry's first point about taking some of the space under the FDR in the staging area of the construction site, because this is a solution that some of us have been discussing and offering and proposing for somewhere between a year and two years to various entities around the city as well as talking among ourselves.
