And I guess that will be probably starting with October meeting The question would also be for Karen and her committee for housing, homelessness and human rights.
We, have a lot of different places where kind of the conditions of public safety are coming from in our community and in the office.
You know people calling into the office as well, but somehow it would be nice to have that public Safety committee report on that once a month you know or quarterly or something Then I know I mentioned before about spending street fair funds.
I do not know if cody have anything additional to report, that paying for additional sanitation baskets or pic basket, service, possibly paying for a DOE fund or an ace person and that's kind of clean.
You know maintenance kind of issue as well or maybe paying for one or two additional outreach people for six months or a year.
So far I have a conversation coming up with the DOE fund, but yesterday I spoke to Ace, and today I spoke to wildcat both of Council member Rivera has is using both services.
They would do some snow removal on curb cuts and things so for one person, eight hours a day for the year is roughly, and you know without them, actually pricing it out and a contract going through.
I have a conversation coming up with them, so once I can hear from everyone, I'll kind of compile them into a spreadsheet, and I can send that I've had some experience with DOE fund So this would pay for a basically a person to go around and do duties so like this would not pay for like the actual carting of trash right.
I mean sanitation, I mean you know, I love a clean street, so you know, but thank you let let's move We have a lot of people with their hands raised, so B, Aussie and Rick, And. Then we'll move the agenda.
You know this is street fair money, And I, do not see us being able to replenish the street fair money next year, because they most likely won't happen again so and we're going through a period of extreme difficulty for the next few years on the city, So I think we just need to make sure we budget ourselves.
And, then I do not know how many people I was not able to make the acs call today, but the acs call was this: I have not looked at it, but I shared the presentation, because just to make this update a little shorter for everybody just quickly, they did a really nice job.
As, you know, all the permanent shelters have committee advisory, boards, so molly one thing you'll want to do is or if this happens for the next chair, whether that may be is start thinking about folks who will sit on that community.
You know like just ongoing outreach to kind of get feedback from the community on the issues that are most important to them.
He said that he thinks that the next meeting I believe he said it would be likely in October And, we'll be part of it, but given that their real estate and their financial teams are still kind of figuring out what to do and they're trying to get past.
We can get someone to come, but if not just kind of like preliminarily talk about it as a committee, and then we had this , I think on the agenda last week, but did not really talk through it or it was new business.
, that's running people, no one's died yet, but it's very bad We buy some of those with our street fair funds, but you know like we need to And there's a a bill.
That's in any way different than the way they submitted it just so we have your approval and the committee will be doing the final vote at a short like 30-minute meeting before full board in October, You think that there's something that has not been communicated to the budget and governmental affairs Committee about the budget, it's technically too late, but we'll If there's something important.
If you want, I can staff that meeting by myself and that way you guys can meet on the night of Columbus day like you, normally would, and that may give you a little bit more breathing space than having to do it all right before full board, because that can be stressful for you.
I was going to ask you, sent this list out to the I think, Ps 116 and maybe ps281 PTA folks for their concerns about the temporary shelters It was a really comprehensive list of the four shelters so far in our district and kind of what they're who they're serving And, then you even included the Cd5, temporary shelters, temporary hotels, and I thought it was really a nice document.
The feelers we'll get back more information that shortly regarding the meeting in October way, far in advance, so for our committee, we're just going to just place a permanent placeholder for eastside coast, resiliency, just sort of updates.
If you're, following what's happening with our schools, you're aware of that I've tried I've, reached out to several people and What I think is the best thing we can do Is I can get a spokesperson from the DOE to come to our next meeting on the next week and talk about where school opening is now.
Tuesday is get someone from the DOE from you know, to come and be there They're, spending, 10 and 14 hours a day just trying to get schools open and one person.
And I, think what we need is someone from central from face of families and community engagement to come and describe and take accountability for what Central has done here and not put it on a superintendent who is just trying to make the best of a very bad situation, and that's my own personal I.
Think the Covid-19 And then, once we see what happens as schools open, you know we can figure out what to do in October, because right now, I I, just you know, and people are so mad.
Even, before Covid-19 about protection- You know labor rights and things like that.
So hopefully we get a presentation from them at the end of this month and then any further discussion on it can happen in October as well And There is pending legislation that was introduced last year, particularly around anti- trafficking, human rights and things like that, Kyle questions for Kyle, okay, I'm I have to back up to transportation.
I have a presentation that we've been talking about for a long time, it's a little weird because it's the underpass at 37Th street between the Fdr Thank you, and so we have a design, an idea to get people thinking about it.
That, like they'll, come to present at the October meeting and then rich.
Guess your agenda is already quite large, but Well I think it's like it could be a discussion if you, if it, but it kind of flows into that other issue.
There are 11 in CB5, okay, That's why this information is so useful, because I think when people compare the upper West side and all the you know brouhaha about that, they do not have.
