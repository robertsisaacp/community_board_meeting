I. Guess we'll just go right into meeting the committee business and the first item is the chairs report.
And I know there have been some questions about adding a public safety committee back into the board.
And we, I, don't know how, many years ago it was, but we used to have a transportation public safety committee.
We talked about having 13th and 17th come to those meetings, but you know I'd hate, I It would be great if they could come to both, but we'll definitely want to invite them to the transportation public safety committee, meeting.
Since it's our opportunity to get directly in front of them, right, I know there have been a lot of issues around public safety lately.
So I was talking to again thinking how we can translate or compile all the information from 3-1-1 crime stats from the 13th and 17th, maybe even reports from like DHS or the outreach teams breaking ground and the folks like that are in our community.
We, have a lot of different places where kind of the conditions of public safety are coming from in our community and in the office.
You know people calling into the office as well, but somehow it would be nice to have that public safety committee report on that once a month you know or quarterly or something Then I know I mentioned before about spending street fair funds.
I, don't know if cody have anything additional to report, that paying for additional sanitation baskets or pic basket, service, possibly paying for a DOE fund or an ace person and that's kind of clean.
You know maintenance kind of issue as well or maybe paying for one or two additional outreach people for six months or a year.
I have a conversation coming up with them, so once I can hear from everyone, I'll kind of compile them into a spreadsheet, and I can send that I've had some experience with DOE fund So this would pay for a basically a person to go around and do duties so like this wouldn't pay for, like the actual carting of trash.
You know this is street fair money, And I, don't see us being able to replenish the street fair money next year, because they most likely won't happen again so and we're going through a period of extreme difficulty for the next few years on the city So I think we just need to make sure we budget ourselves.
As, you know, all the permanent shelters have committee advisory, boards, so molly one thing you'll want to do is or if this happens for the next chair, whether that may be is start thinking about folks who will sit on that community advisory, board.
You know like just ongoing outreach to kind of get feedback from the community on the issues that are most important to them.
Since, we've been so focused on msbi for the last several months, we're gonna go back and kind of vet out whatever open items require our attention next and prioritize, and we had been talking about remappings of some streets and we may look at that again in terms especially of like you, Know: Potential, waterfront access.
We can get someone to come, but if not just kind of like preliminarily talk about it as a committee, and then we had this , I think on the agenda last week, but didn't really talk through it Or it was new business, but talking about a red light camera at sudden place and 54th street, and so both of those things could be like possible.
That's in any way different than the way they submitted it just so we have your approval and the committee will be doing the final vote at a short like 30-minute meeting before full board in October, You think that there's something that hasn't been communicated to the budget and governmental affairs committee about the budget, it's technically too late, but we'll If there's something important.
I was looking at the exchange you had with brendan regarding the meeting that would have been held normally on columbus day if it makes it easier for the committee If you want, I can staff that meeting by myself and that way you guys can meet on the night of columbus day, like you normally would, and that may give you a little bit more breathing space than having to do it all right before full board, because that can be stressful for you.
I. Don't want to take the time of the committee members Either it's a holiday for those people who are working, god still have those kind of things.
We have a an actual impacted unsheltered in in individual from vocal called felix, his name's felix, and then we have sheila from the drug policy alliance, who has been at cb6 before I had a very long conversation with matt roberts to make sure that I have all the facts Come back to me, but, speaking to him, I thought that a great additional panelist would be the midtown community court kind of talking about they're, terrific They're great, and it would be like law and order and kind of talking, about.
But I, don't know how we all feel about this, but to have the all the permanent shelters and just kind of a little synopsis, like you have here for the 30th street, the 40, the women's shelter and 44 the 17th I need to follow up on that, because I asked the office You know at the office.
If you're, following what's happening with our schools, you're aware of that I've tried I've, reached out to several people and What I think is the best thing we can do Is I can get a spokesperson from the DOE to come to our next meeting on the next week and talk about where school opening is now.
That's brought up the our local schools, because if we have a better understanding of their specific ask, we then can advocate for them more specifically If. We could do that on tuesday, get any people from pas who would like to or would be able to come, but this is so fluid.
So, since we're kind of clearing them out some of these things that may sort of re-emerge we'll leave it to you to sort of tell us Let's put this back, and I admit I, neglected that this month, I've just been swamped with a bunch of things, but I think the Covid-19 19 Then, once we see what happens as schools open, you know we can figure out what to do in October, because right now, I I, just you know, and people are so mad.
If I can't remember I, guess your agenda is already quite large, but Well I think it's like it could be a discussion if you, if it, but it kind of flows into that other issue.
