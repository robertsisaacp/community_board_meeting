All right sounds good, hello, everyone and welcome to the November 19th 2020 meeting of the CB6 business affairs and street activities.
The agenda for tonight's meeting was distributed ahead of time by the board office and appears on the screen before you.
You have a question about committee business or wish to make a motion.
The chat function should not be used for committee business or questions about agenda.
One is a new application for an on-premise liquor license for a dozen bagels incorporated doing business as Kipps Bay or Sorry Kip's bagel cafe at 429 third Avenue.
So, this is an on-premise liquor license application for dozen Bagels Coat Inc Kips Bagel Cafe, we're located at 429 third avenue on the corner of East 30th street.
That's all just wondering if you're going to do that, because it looks like great real estate for you to do that to help out with your business.
So I, wonder if any of the committee members have specific questions for this establishment.
You know post-covered restrictions, yes, okay, same hours, though that's great does anyone else from the committee have excuse me any other questions.
But I'm wondering I just asked because I want to know if you have talked to any other boards or are you starting on your home, base.
And I'm, going to let the committee ask you some questions as well as see some cancer.
It's a very obscure provision for the most part, I think it was done for nutritional reasons where there was this idea from federal legislators that if you give people who need snap more options when it comes to prepared foods, they'll, just use it on fast food.
You know, prepare food for yourself without the assistance of others, so I think that was a specific provision why it was targeted towards these populations.
Why you know, and if the, if it's a federal program, how and why New York state is able to make specific alterations to the benefits.
I know it's in committee now, but when it's expected to go to the on the floor, I'm, looking at the calendar right now, online.
State Senator, Roxanne, yeah, perfect, I, don't see any other questions from the committee.
We'll draft some, a resolution within this committee and then moving forward our full board meeting again at last one, but the next one is early December.
That'd be perfect, but before that happens, I, wonder if anyone wants to make a motion on the committee.
I'm wondering if anyone on the committee wants to write this resolution.
So I've done a little bit of work on that, but here I'm, just a citizen leading the committee, but speaking of open, streets, Anton and I.
You know what we can do and work on as a committee and just thinking ahead into the winter and the status of open streets in general.
Our city is like really fragile, right now, as we all know, and no one knows what the future brings, but I think that, obviously we are committed to supporting these businesses and you know want them to stay open as much as possible.
So just wanted to thank everybody, the committee members and keep up the great work, and I'm.
So proud of everyone that everyone is in other leadership positions on the board as well, which I think is just a testament to all the great work that you do on this committee.
I, don't see any other hands from our committee, but I wonder if any members of the public want to bring anything up or ask a question.
