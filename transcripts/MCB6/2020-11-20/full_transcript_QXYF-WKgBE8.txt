We are required by executive order to create a verbatim transcript of the meeting. So please keep your questions and comments, succinct and remained in the discussion. Now we will move to committee business item number. One is a new application for an on-premise liquor license for a dozen bagels incorporated doing business as Kipps Bay or Sorry Kip's bagel cafe at 429 third Avenue I believe Michael Kelly is joining us. I'm Robert Callahan I work at Mike Kelly's office. Okay, thanks Robert. Sorry about that. Does that know your name again, please Robert Callahan C-A-l-L also joining us is Lana. Who is the general manager and your name is Lana unmute yourself on the on the participant. Sorry Lana L-A-n-a, your last name, Eliajo E-L-I Y-A-h-U! Thank you both okay, so I'll. Let shall I proceed yeah. So if you could just begin by walking us through the application that you all submitted. So this is an on-premise liquor license application for dozen Bagels Coat Inc Kips Bagel Cafe, we're located at 429 third avenue on the corner of East 30th street we've been in operation for over 15 years in that location, due to the current times, we're changing our business model, we're enhancing it a bit. So, instead of just the bagel store, we want more of a cafe type atmosphere, so we're moving towards the cafe feeling and not so much as a bagel store, we're going to be upgrading our menu to offer salads sandwiches, pastas and some light dishes with the Mediterranean flair. We're still going to be doing the breakfast service. You know you'll still be able to get your bagels and everything that you've gotten before, but we're going to offer some different things as well have more of a sit-down type atmosphere, so the place itself is not going to change much physically. Currently, we have five tables with 32 seats. Our hours of operations of 6 am to 11 pm every day. So it's not going to be a late night spot. We just want to offer the customers an opportunity to have a cocktail with this new menu. We have background music from an iPad or an ipod, but really you shouldn't notice a lot of changes. If you have any questions, we'd be glad to answer them. Thank you. So you said that you're planning on closing at 11 pm every night, or is that just on the weekends, every night yeah that that's been our hours and I, don't think the owner really wants to change it up that much she's been doing it for 15 years. Okay and then did you. This is a residential building that you all would be operating in. Yes and I, read through your application, obviously- and it said that you all will be providing proof of support from some of the tenants in the building. Did my office send you not to my knowledge, I, don't know Cody. We received the questionnaire as submitted, but no kind of like affirmation from any of the tenants in the building. You know I'm looking through the file that I have with me. I, don't know if my office sent you know, exchange with the background. I know we have some signatures. You could just explain it. What is that? We have I, see that here it's a paper that says we, the residents and neighbors, are the above restaurant support and its application for nonprofit license. The hours of operation will be 11 P.M seven days a week, and we have one two: three, four: five: six, seven, eight nine 10:11 signatures from 427,425 3Rd avenue, so that's the big building above us and right next door, 200 East 30Th street, which is right around the corner: 154 East 29th, another 200 East 30th degree, which Lana the address. That's above us is 200 30th street right yeah. So we have one two three four from upstairs from both sides, so we do have some signatures of support I'll, be able to I'll, fax those to your office or to I'll email them to anyone that needs them. Okay, thank you. So much you're welcome genie. You had a question. Yes, hi. Just a quick question: I'm just looking at the picture of the of the restaurant from the street level. There's a lot of sidewalk space: are they using it at all for outdoor cafe because it's on the corner? So there's a lot of interesting, real estate to to work off of Lana. You guys doing the outdoor seating right now, I'll answer that sure we applied for the outdoor license. We are going to put tables and chairs out there on the sidewalk and, yes, we will utilize the space. Okay, that's all just wondering if you're going to do that, because it looks like great real estate for you to do that to help out with your business I. Thank you and it will help definitely to bring more patrons and think that there's right now, 25 limit inside the store, so at least painters will have the availability to sit outside in the fresh air. Great, thank you thanks and so do you have a plan for that setup? Is it just on the sidewalk or are you planning on using the roadway? Well right now, right now the tables have to be against the building line. So most you could do. Is one table every six feet along the building line. The streets are available, I actually have to just check the parking regulations, because, depending on what the sign says, you can use them sometimes and not others, but the winter is coming and the city just added to the regulations on the roadway seating. So there's a lot of changes. You got ta everything has to be filled with sand or water. You have to add things so right now, not sure if they're going to be using the roadway, but definitely looking to use the sidewall. Thank you does anyone else on the committee? Have any questions? Okay, hearing! None! Are there any questions from the public? Ah, not that I see. Okay. Does anyone on the committee want to make a motion motion to accept I'll? Second, that, okay? So now we will take a vote approving the application for a dozen bagels or bagel Cafe by roll call. So when Cody says your name for your vote, please unmute yourself and answer in favor Dan Divine in favor, Jeannie D'onofrio in favor, Charles Fernandez in favor, page judge in favor nine in favor, none against unabstaining, none not entitled that hundred thousands, great, so Cody from the office will be following up with you all, thanks for taking the time out to explain a little bit more. Thank you very much. Thank you very much should I email this list to the office in the morning, yeah. If you don't mind that would be helpful for our records. I'll see that all right, I'll be at about the 8:30, so I'll make sure it gets done whenever you can. Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you both take care. Thank you. Everyone! Thank you! So much bye, okay. So the next item in the agenda is new wine. Beer and cider liquor license for a restaurant known as Hunan Village at 339 Lexington Avenue. Do you have any?

Good night have a good night, have a good one all right! Thank you, okay, great. That is all of the licenses that we have for today. So thank you all for your questions. Now, I'm not sure if you all remember from our last full board meeting Daniella Schill came and offered some information about State Senate Bill s720a, which is a bill that would establish a statewide restaurant meals program as part of the supplemental nutrition and assistance program. Daniella I will let you take it away now, if you're ready yeah. Absolutely. Thank you. So much for having me come by I didn't prepare a presentation. I wasn't sure if I had to, but just to speak a little bit about the program. So the restaurant meals program is an optional provision under the federal snap regulations and if states decide to enact a restaurant meals program within the state that allows for elderly, disabled and homeless map recipients to use their benefits, their existing benefits at participating. Restaurants. So essentially, this just increases the amount of options that people who already have many vulnerabilities can have when it comes to using their benefits and especially in the time of the pandemic. This can provide a lot of help to restaurants as well, because they can have and add a source of revenue from different. You know types of people, so if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them. Please. Let me know great thanks Danielle. It makes sense to me and it sounds like a great idea: I'm just wondering what its status like incentives. Is it who's sponsoring it does it happen, yeah it's currently in the Social Services Committee in the state Senate, so I figured that having some support from local community boards could really push the issue forward and you know provide some support for it and I. Remember you saying that you lived in our district right yeah, so I've lived here for about four years: I attended, Hunter College, so I've been living in kids space for quite a while. It's amazing I also was a hunter college student, so oh wow in common good people and hunter for sure, but I'm wondering I just asked because I want to know if you have talked to any other boards or are you starting on your home base, yeah I just started here: I haven't spoken to anybody else. Just figured I'd start with. You know the people I know best yeah. That makes sense to me. Well thanks again for coming and I'm going to let the committee ask you some questions as well as see some cancer. Let's start with Kevin, if you don't mind: Kevin hi Danielle, what was the opposition to prepared foods before this? It sounds good, but what was the opposition I? Don't know? Why wasn't a part of the program before? Was it yeah? It's a very obscure provision for the most part, I think it was done for nutritional reasons where there was this idea from federal legislators that if you give people who need snap more options when it comes to prepared foods, they'll just use it on fast food and obviously that's not a very good reason to prevent people from using their benefits, the way that they see fit, and especially, if we have more community and local restaurant participation, it doesn't have to be just you know, using your benefits at fastest places. Thank you, yeah. Absolutely good question. Next up is Dan couple of questions. First, how did you become involved or interested in this yeah? So I'm currently a graduate student at the CUNY grad center. So we've been focusing all semester on advocacy efforts and we wanted specifically to focus on food advocacy, because food insecurity is so high currently due to the pandemic, and this was an issue that I saw was coming up in the state, Senate and I figured. This is something that can really make a very big difference in people's lives. So if this one passage of the legislation, can you know make such a big difference across the state? You know I figured. It was something that was worth my time got it and then, following up on that, you mentioned that this would be reserved for I, guess the elderly, disabled and homeless. Can you give me kind of a little better sense of why it was determined for those groups and then out of the total amount of people receiving snap benefits? What do those groups represent? Yeah, so I, don't really know the exact history of why these groups were chosen. I think it was due to vulnerabilities, like specifically with homeless people. It can be difficult to have the space to prepare food or store food for preparation with elderly and disabled people. Receiving snap can be difficult to. You know, prepare food for yourself without the assistance of others, so I think that was a specific provision why it was targeted towards these populations. Ideally, if I were you know, drafting policy I would want to apply to everyone receiving snap. But you know one step at a time. I think is better than nothing and as for our specific district I don't have the numbers for community board six. It was kind of difficult to find, but in state Senate, District 27, which is encompassing most of our community board. Around 22 percent of the population, is over. The age of 60. 29 is under the poverty level, so quite a few people would be eligible and if I had better data, I would let you know, but I think quite a few thousands of people would be impacted in our district alone, got it and then I guess just the last question is that as I understand, snap is a federal program and I? Don't I forget what the acronym is for New York state, but can you go into a little bit more detail about the difference and why you know, and if the, if it's a federal program, how and why New York state is able to make specific alterations to the benefits? Yeah? Absolutely that's! Actually, a very good question. So from what I understand about the history in the 1970s, this provision for the restaurant meals program was given on the federal level, but it was optional for states to implement it and for quite a few decades no one did anything and then in California the Cal fresh program decided to participate in restaurant meals and it had a huge success rate, and this was in the early 2000s and they just recently became a statewide program rather than county specifics within the California district. Rhode Island, followed, Arizona, followed, I, think there's a pilot program now in Illinois and Maryland. So slowly but surely many more states are taking on the optional restaurant meals program because it's showing benefits and I think it just didn't really become a federal thing because it was optional rather than mandatory. Thank you absolutely Jeannie. Did you get your question answered? Actually I do have a question so I know it's in committee right now, Danielle. Thank you for coming. First of all this evening. Absolutely thank you. Yeah I know it's in committee now, but when it's expected to go to the on the floor, I'm looking at the calendar right now online. Like the you know the bill and that's number one and number two: what can we do to be of help to you? I'm not sure when it's going to vote honestly, I am still in the process of advocating for it. So I'm not exactly certain when it's actually going to be heard, I think right now, it's just about you know, gathering support and from the community board a letter of support or something that shows that you know the force of the people is behind. This type of legislation could definitely be some help. I'm planning on meeting with legislature, legislators personally in the coming weeks. So if you have any testimonies or anything that you would like me to pass along to them when I meet with them, that would also be great help. So just let me know. Thank you absolutely thank you. I'm sorry Daniella hi! This is Sema again just outgoing genies. You know thanks for joining us, do you you might have said this, I'm sorry if I missed it, do you know who sponsored the bill. I believe I have to look it up, I believe it was in the Social Services Committee. It had I, think seven co-sponsors I have to look at the specific name. Okay, it's okay! I can look it up to it. Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. I think state Senator, Roxanne, yeah, perfect, I, don't see any other questions from the committee and I also don't see any from any attendees, but I'm going to give you all a second to raise your hand. If there are any questions. Okay, see, none! Sorry, I do have a question. So, what's the timeline of getting something to you, Daniella from us from the community board, maybe within like after thanksgiving within like within two weeks, if that would be possible, like just some kind of letter of support or even by the middle December, really depends on your time. I don't want to put any unnecessary pressure on all of you. I understand how busy everyone is. Okay, thanks, so typically how things work? Should we decide to support your efforts, we'll draft some, a resolution within this committee and then moving forward our full board meeting again at last one, but the next one is early December. So the board would vote on the resolution there and then that would be kind of your official letter of approval from us that okay, yeah that'd be perfect, but before that happens, I wonder if anyone wants to make a motion on the committee. I'd like to make a motion of support. Okay Kyle makes me a second genie. Will second, that, okay and now we'll vote together again on supporting this bill right. Kyle Kylo played in favor Claire Brennan in Favor Dan Divine in favor, Genie D'onofrio. In favor, Charles Fernandez in favor, page judge in favor, Anton Muller in favor, Kevin O'keefe in favor, see Michelle in favor all right. That's also nine in favor not opposed no staying, no, not entitled. Thank you. Thanks for joining us I'll play I'm wondering if anyone on the committee wants to write this resolution. I'll write it you appreciate it and I can help if you need it perfect. Thank you Claire. This sounds really great and necessary, so that is all on our agenda. I'll move to my report, which will be brief. First of all, I just want to thank you all for welcoming me as chair. I'm honored to serve in this role and I really appreciate your patience with me, just getting to know Bossa a little bit more and my efforts to become more familiar with the process and how everything goes, but I previously was in transportation and in housing as well. So a lot of the issues and kind of ways things go mimic each other from like transportation and here on a personal level, I actually work for the department of transportation and we're in charge of open streets. So I've done a little bit of work on that, but here I'm just a citizen leading the committee, but speaking of open streets, Anton and I were talking earlier this week about. You know what we can do and work on as a committee and just thinking ahead into the winter and the status of open streets in general. Our city is like really fragile right now, as we all know, and no one knows what the future brings, but I think that obviously we are committed to supporting these businesses and you know want them to stay open as much as possible safely. So you know thinking about outdoor dining in general and the you know: potential use of heat lamps or additional kind of furniture on the streets, Anton and I were wondering if you all, could kind of take this next month to look around your neighborhoods and the establishments that are by you and kind of just note down some observations. So next month we can kind of have a discussion on open dining, it's ever-changing for sure. So what is today might not be tomorrow, but I think that certainly into December. Hopefully, we have a better idea of what the winter brings, so we can kind of talk about, maybe some restaurants that are doing it really well and are organized and if there's any out there, that you know where the sidewalks blocked- or there are some concern concerning conditions, we can kind of walk through that and just share thoughts and ideas. But that's really it from me again really excited to be here and work with you all moving forward. Does anyone have any old or new business to discuss? You can raise your hand now and Kyle, hey everybody, so my new business is that I'm old business I just want to you know, first of all congratulate Claire on a very well-run first meeting for Basa. The only feedback I have is that now that you ran this meeting so quickly. That is the expectation for the committee members going forward. So you've dug yourself in all. No I'm just kidding no I just want to thank everybody. On this committee. It's been a real pleasure to serve as your chair for the past several years, we've put together a really dynamic committee. That's been on the forefront of a lot of these issues, which has been shown through this whole pandemic that we were leading a lot of discussion on economic recovery on the store fronts, of course, outdoor dining and partnership with transportation. So it's just been really wonderful to be part of that, and I am sad to be leaving the committee meetings, but of course, I won't be too far away as the chair, but yeah just keep up the great work and I'm going to miss you all in our Thursday night meetings. It really has been wonderful and yeah. I'm glad that we were able to end on such a wonderful meeting, so just wanted to thank everybody, the committee members and keep up the great work, and I'm so proud of everyone that everyone is in other leadership positions on the board as well, which I think is just a testament to all the great work that you do on this committee. So thank you, everybody and hey Kyle. Thanks for showing me the ropes, it's been a pleasure being with you this last almost two years. Thank you. Yes, I have big shoes to fill and Claire it's going to be great working with you. Congratulations thank you. I appreciate it. I see Kevin's hand up next, oh, but you have to unmute yourself now. I could talk I'll echo. What we said about Kyle and Claire I just want to make sure it's 36th street between first and second, the open street. Is that something that can tuck into discussions on Basa because that's being looked at, you know by parks and looking at by transportation. But you know all the more involvement cross-sectional help we can get to address. That would be wonderful, yeah, I, agree, I, think we can talk about that in the conversation that we're going to have next month for sure wonderful. Thank you. Thanks! No problem, okay, I, don't see any other hands from our committee, but I wonder if any members of the public want to bring anything up or ask a question. Okay, seeing none I am going to ask for a motion to adjourn I believe this is the shortest CB6 meeting. I have ever attended so motion to adjourn I'll make it my last thing final moment: this doesn't require a second. So if there are no objections here, we will adjourn the meeting thanks, Claire bye. Thank you.
