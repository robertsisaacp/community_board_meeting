Okay, with that said, let's jump into tonight's agenda. The first item on the agenda is ups and downs. Incorporated is requesting an extension of term of a previously granted variance for the continued operation of the eating and drinking establishment. The townhouse at 234 east 58th street, which is an r8 zoning district. All right would the representative from ups and downs like to begin their presentation. We've got fred, although okay, so fred, you need to unmute yourself. Can you hear me now? Yes, okay, so good evening, my name is Fred becker, I'm the attorney for ups and downs. This is an application for an extension of variants that allowed an eating and drinking establishment at the subject, location on the south side of 40 seconds of east 58th street between second and third avenue. What you have here is a situation where it is an Rh zone, despite the fact that almost every single use on that block is commercial, a variance was granted back in 1984. It has been renewed since that time, every 15 or every 10 years it most recently expired in July of this year we extended the application we filed an extension of the application timely. The townhouse bar is a long- established, gay bar. It is of quiet nature. I do not believe there are any complaints. At least I am not aware of any. Our request is just to continue the facility and the operation, as we have been doing for the last 10 years, with no changes to the floor plan to the hours of operation or anything else, and hopefully we'll be open again one day and that's it we're requesting another 10-year term by the way. Okay. Presentation finished, I'm sorry Presentation finished. Okay, great thank you. Does anyone from the community have any questions? I just have one quick question. I just wanted to confirm that we have not received any complaints from this location either directly through the board office or through three one. I do not know if cody or someone is able to tell us if yeah, that's, okay, we've had no no complaints about this establishment previously, either in either way that you've suggested 311 or direct Adam. It looks like Lou is asking for the floor. Actually Anne, Hanner and Hannah are hand raised from the in the platform. I'm sorry I skipped over here still doing and then Lou. Okay. You know Sandro kind of asked one of my questions, whether just to confirm there were no questions. I have to say I looked you guys up online first, you know before the meeting, and I see you get very good reviews on Google maps, which is nice, but it has zero presence on yelp like they do not. They know you exist and I that was just a little bit of a red flag to me. So I unfortunately can't speak to that. I mean I do not know why. There's no reason like there's no change in the ownership and operation has been the same for the past 35 years. Basically, the owner of the building has been the same all along. I guess it's just everyone knows it's there and that's the way it is. Lou move a resolution of no objection to the to the application. Second, that excellent all those in favor Adam. Do you want to you want to do it by roll call or I'm fine, just doing a voice vote. I guess, can we just do any objections, raise your hand via the chat function or just say: if you have an objection like the way you did right or agenda and stuff okay. So if we have any objections, please raise them in the please raise your hand via the Zoom bar okay, seeing none. This resolution passes, who would like to author at this resolution I'll be happy to Sandro. Thank you, raise your hand in real life and what was the count on that on that reso? You know it's unanimous or cody. Can you fill that in? If I just say unanimous in the minutes, we've got ten members and no one. No one, okay demonstrate it in the opposition. You'll. Keep me honest on this excellent thanks. I tried to be efficient with that, but I think actually we spent just as much time outside of the roll call. So you know see what do we can do anyway. Thank you very much fred for your presentation and thank you. I look forward to authoring this resolution and support okay. Thank you. Everyone stay safe, be well bye-, bye, okay, with that said, let's move to item number two, which is the standing item in our committee, which is an update on the eastside coastal resiliency project. I believe, there's a presentation that they'll be the team will be sharing with us, yeah Adam, I'm going to share my screen, so I'm just doing that right now. Wonderful, thank you and in the meantime, can everybody hear me? Yes, we can great hi Adam hi everybody. This is Q amiri from DDC Cultural resiliency unit, while desiree pulls up the presentation. I'll kick us off here. We are approaching our construction phase for this part of the project pretty soon, and we wanted to give you folks update here tonight. We do not have too many details as of yet still because the contractor is still submitting their schedule and all their documents and everything that we need to review, but wanted to give you the information that we have available and we'll come back obviously, next month, with a lot more details to be able to answer a lot more questions so for tonight we have a couple updates on the pre- construction phase that that's almost behind us now for this particular area and what's next for construction phase and my colleagues from our agent TV Liro team, John, Lynch and Desiree Gasol will walk us through that and a couple of overall reminders sprinkled throughout this presentation. So with that John I'll hand it off to you and you can walk us through. What's next, okay sure my name is John Lynch, I'm the project manager for hntb liro, assisting DDC in the administration of the construction for these four projects- we're looking at here. So we have about 15, slides I'll, speak first, then desiree to community engagement and then we're going to introduce our community construction liaison so should not take too long. Most of you familiar with the four projects right now we're just about to enter construction on the first project, Pa2 in the north, from 15th street to 25th street, and then we have the pa1, which is the Big East River Park Further south that's going to take bids into early November. So then it's got to go through this process. I'm going to walk us through a little bit and then parallel conveyance. We anticipate that going out on the street for bids and then being awarded and starting in the spring. We can go to the so just we're a lot farther along than we were some months back so for Pa2, also called sanres M2. It's they're interchangeable from 15th street to 25th street. We have an ntp date for this. That's going to be November 16th! So right now the contractor selected and they've started putting in their submittals things like their baseline schedule, their site safety plan, anything that we can review so that we hit the ground running on November 16th. We go to the so. The first area is to be worked in with the aster Levy park in the solar one area master levy, because we're allowing them into one of the three parks at a time with some overlap and Nasser levy is the first one that will be worked on, and then we move to Stuyvesant cove, which will be in done in two phases, so the whole park is not out of service at once and then down to Murphy brothers playground. The reason the solar one area gets worked on first is because they were planning to construct the building there. We wanted to get the heavy construction of a flood wall out of the way before they construct a new facility in that site. Okay, we can go to the great quick update on pa1 or San Res M1, that's the big park to the south from montgomery up to 15th 14th street. So this one, as I said before, where we've got we're taking the bids on in early November and so then we'll move into the contract registration phase and then it gets awarded and then notice to proceed. So that's should be by the end of the year or early 2021.. You can go to the so yeah. The thing we want to note on this slide is that the park's going to remain open for all 2020 and then obviously when it gets done, it's done in phases so that at least about half the park is open at all times for the public to use. So I'm going to take over from John here. So just a reminder, we presented this at the last presentation, but there is a community outreach process. Again, it's an elected official, then the community boards and the cag the advisory group. Then we'll have a series of public notifications and then just ongoing updates here at the Community Board meetings and the cad meetings, all presentations that we present at community board meetings and cag meetings and then any future presentations to the public are posted on the new website. The new website is the same address as the old website, and it is here and then there's a link again at the end at the end or you can google New York City DDC ESCR for esker, so I'm very happy to announce our newsy skill for Pa2, Nadine, Harris and nadine. If you want to take yourself off of mute, you could say a few words just to remind everybody. The community construction liaison is the presence in the community. She'll be the boots on the ground. We will work through the Covid-19 restrictions that we have right now, but nadine will be at all of the Community board meetings and she will be the face behind the web- based public inquiry tool from the from the website from moving forward. So nadine, if you want to introduce yourself the floor, is yours hi good afternoon, everyone I'm Nadine Harris, I am the liaison. As the Xero mentioned. I have been a liaison for 16 years, going on 17 on several different projects throughout the five boroughs of New York City. I understand the project is very it's a. It will be a challenging project, but we are we're all going to work together to make it happen in a safely manner. So again, I will be on site physically 20 anytime. You need, you can always reach me via email phone, and I will be there to answer most of your questions with the construction team, the contractor and the resident engineer as a whole. So I will pass that down to back to desiree unless anybody has any questions for me thanks nadine and I think we'll take questions at the end. So if anybody has any questions, just hold them hold up a little bit. Thank you. You're welcome, okay, a little update on our section, 3 and mwbe resources. We have updated this page on the website tomorrow evening is part three of the hntb partners. Webinar create a compelling RFP narrative. The registration link is here and again it is on the website again. This is just a very general overview of the community engagement strategy. It has a general timeline of the projects as we anticipate them and then the other kind of items that we have mentioned, which are progressing forward and also especially as Pa 2 kind of picks up here in the next month. I just wanted to note that we do have a community advisory group meeting next well, on November 5th is the next one. If anyone is interested in knowing when that is, and for more information again, you could visit us at the new website or the revised website, which is www.nyc.gov forward, slash esker, and that is the close of our presentation today. Like you said at next month's presentation, we will have more information on Pa2. Thank you excellent. Thank you. Thank you all and welcome to Dean. We look forward to seeing you in future meetings. So thank you my I guess my initial. My initial question is so with updates in the next meeting regarding Pa2. Do we expect to hear more about some of the potential mitigation efforts for once construction starts to begin in full in 2021 yeah? This is John. Are you talking about like environmental mitigation? I'm sorry mitigation and so much that, like when the park is closed, other aspects or basically I think in previous resolutions CB our this committee and the and the board put forth a host of different ideas and other sorts of things for mitigations. For when the park is actually closed, I not available atom mitigation as in like during construction like the construction, fencing project and things like that or interim wreck. What could you be just a little bit more special yeah look interim wreck yeah. So when the park is closed, where can people go to experience, open space, sure and aldi you're on correct? Yes, I was just going to jump in hi everyone all the Chan from New York City parks. I think I had some of my colleagues were present at last month's meeting, we're happy to give an update on some of the items. I think there's been some discussion about Waterside. I think folks are aware of some of the new turfs. That's supposed to be coming in that will be installed next spring. Definitely yeah we can. We can do a more formal presentation on that and just while we're at it parks also recently revamped our own parks esker website, and we can make sure we have a link and we can share it with you tonight as well. It's Www.Nyc.Gov parks Esker, and I mentioned that because there's actually a tool on our website. That is an interactive map where you can choose by the type of recreational facility you're. Looking for you can look for you know: basketball, courts or softball fields in the General Esker project vicinity, and that's one of the tools that we're launching so that folks know where to go. If they're looking for parks that are open, you know right now. It shows all the parks open since the escrow project has not yet started, but once the construction starts, we're going to be coordinating with the DDC web team to make sure that our interactive map tool shows you know which parks are closed and where you can go so we're definitely happy to come back next month and give a more comprehensive update on that sort of recreation aspect of like what happens during construction. Great. Thank you. That's all I have so we'll go we'll go to the committee members we'll go with Sandy and then we'll go Larry. I wondered if you had an update on solar one. You mentioned that you're actually trying to accommodate their construction. I know we heard from them at our last meeting that they were not sure of the timing of the construction. Do you have an update on that yeah? We had a meeting with pdc and solar one. Maybe it was two weeks ago now and just because there was some, they did not know exactly what was going on and we told them that we're going to maintain access to that building. We thought at the time when we put this contract together, that this was going to be two contractors in there. At the same time, they'd be building a new facility. It does not appear that they're going to build the new facility in the near term, but it may happen down the road. So that's the reason why we're building the wall first, and so we have spoken with solarwind and we're going to maintain access to their building from both the north and the south. While we build the wall on the West side and then just from the north, when Steichov Park gets closed further south right, so we'll make sure that the we accommodate solar ones operation, they continue to stay in that building and will you have to reroute the bike lane or any of the pedestrian passage in that area? Yeah? Well, when you park, when we close the park, yeah, no four solar ones, the Wall adjacent to solar wind. What about they won't yeah, I mean there'll, be a wall there. I'm sorry, are you re- routing any of the existing? You know the pedestrian way past the building. I'm just wondering how much of that area gets closed down for the construction, we'll have to work that out with with our contractor, for their operations and and with solar one, because they have to be able to use that building and get to it to continue operating so and I'm thinking more of the people who use the Waterfront Walkway and the way there is that going to be closed or not? Well, the bikeway, it's gets closed yeah. Where do they go yeah? Where has that been rerouted? To I'm sorry did we not know like this was when they were doing the closure? This is what we were unhappy about whatever like eight months ago right and these are the general mitigation efforts that sort of my initial question was sort of alluding to so yeah, so any sort of update everybody has to go all the way over like way like off, like everybody all bikes and pedestrians, and come back up on like 21st street right. Oh the current. The current plan is to reroute them to First Avenue, which is, after all, only a third, a mile or more yeah down 23rd, Street or 25th street and then down there and then back to the river somewhere. I mean I know that Cd3 has Avenue B being used as the jogger and bike path, but that's only up to 14th street, so I mean has not worked out. We do not have to. We do not have a plan Adam, I'm sorry to jump in, but I just feel like we're asking questions about something that it's like. There is no mitigation plan like the mitigation plan is first Avenue and we kind of know that yeah we actually have a copy of the plan that maybe you could explain a little bit more to us. I'm sorry, that's a question for the EDC right, the DDC. Does anyone happen to have that with that they could share Sorry John? Are you going? Are you I'm sorry, everyone Sandy? Could you repeat your question? I was having my connection was in and out. I could not hear you clearly. I'm sorry I'm wondering if anyone can put up the plan for how to reroute around the solar one construction site that you're going to start working on how you're going to reroute, bicyclists and pedestrians through that area it will be rerouted. I do not know if we can answer that right now. We do not have our DOT colleagues on the line either. Unfortunately, John are you? Do you think you'll be able to answer that? Or can we get back to Sandy and everybody else with more details? I think the we would. I think we need to get back with more details, but what I would say is that when Astor Levy was is being worked on and solar one there, the park itself is the Stuyvesant park to the South and Murphy brothers. Playground will remain open, so those would still basically they'll be utilized by the public for the first over a year. So exactly how people would get past that area we'll have to work with our contractors while they build their while they build the wall to maintain because there's basically pedestrians right along the waterfront and then the bikes a little interior to that right, but that that's not you know after lester levy is the first part we're working on and the wall next to solar one. So I would envision maintaining access, but by the public through those areas by bike and by foot until Stuyvesant. Cove park is closed, which does not happen until over a year into the project right. That would be great if you could just share with us exactly how that's going to happen. As you can see, it's a big concern for us. Okay, I understood that. Thank you. Thank you. Larry the floor is yours. Okay last week I attended a meeting of the Stuyvesant Cove park association, which was attended by representatives from solar one, and they mentioned the the sequencing of the construction of the wall, but they also pointed out that the the city, whether it was DDC or or another entity dealing with budget, has put the brakes on their constructing their building, even though it's fully funded, and it did not seem to make any sense to them, and I wanted to alert the Community Board to that that issue and it's a particular concern, I think, to the community. If the construction on solar one is delayed for a significant period after the retaining wall or the flood wall that is being erected next to it, has been completed to get solar one completed and open up that whole area of the park as the work proceeds down to the southern end of the park, I think, is a very important imperative and the the folks at the city who need to green light solar one have to have to understand that. I do not think they do. On a lighter note, the folks at Stuyvesant Cove park association very much want to put on entertainment during the summer in parts of the park where construction is not scheduled for next summer, maybe toward 20th street there's a little area where it opens up, and so please be in touch with them and help to facilitate that. I do not have any other questions about the sequencing of the construction, but I do want to ask you about security and whether you're going to have cameras and the like to prevent theft in the lay down areas, and also the the possibility that you might have encampments growing up as the currently is a homeless encampment at the south entrance to Stuyvesant cove park at Avenue, Scene, East, 18Th, Street, and and certainly we want to discourage that sort of activity which could be a hazard and also present some security issues yeah. So this is John again. Will our contractor profedo contracting has noted that there are some squatters living in the areas under the Fdr drive and in terms of security. Once we have a firm plan on which areas are going to be fenced off and worked inside, we'll have to talk to our contractor about security. We have not specifically mentioned that we need cameras, but they're certainly going to want to safeguard any materials that they bring on site to for installation as well as their equipment. So that's a good question and we'll work with our contractor to address security concerns and the homeless people issue. I guess okay, circling back to the the first issue, which involves the scheduling of construction of solar one. Who can address that? I think that's more of a question for EDC. Is there an EDC rep with the team tonight? No, I do not. It actually may be a DDC question. I think DDC is not going forward with many projects that were in design. I can. I can speak to that a little bit, not too much, but just a little bit to my own knowledge. Yes, there are there's a large number of city projects that went on a temporary pause when the pandemic started some of them resumed. Some of them may be coming back soon. As far as project funding approvals go, the DDC is not an operating agency and we do not have authority or control over that we for any of anybody out there. That really does not know our role, we're essentially a client rep to we're representative to the city as a whole to all these study agencies as the project managers for the city. This solar one project funding is an ongoing discussion and everybody on my side of the team at this in the city family. We all share the same concern and we're coordinating with city hall, with our mayor with our colleagues at the mayor's office, with our colleagues at EDC the last week the week prior to that this week we have a lot of discussions and coordination calls going on. So if I can just ask for everybody's patience and just hang tight, I we do not have any updates yet I'll try to get more information if I can, but next month, we'll come back. We'll be sure that our colleagues at EDC are here with us. So we can jointly give everybody an update, but between now and then I'm sure some more information would probably come up that we could share with you folks. I know that's not very helpful, but just wanted to say it's a it's an ongoing discussion and we all share the same concern. I do want to see if you have any kind of a reaction or a response to the the idea that the sequencing of this project in terms of currently the south end of Stuyvesant cove park, is being made available for public use, with the idea that the construction will be completed all aspects including solar one before they have to close down the southern end and if that remains basically an open sore, then none of the park will be available, and this I'd like to see, if you have any thoughts about how you might want to address that John correct me. If I'm wrong, I do not think we would have a moment. The park is phased. The northern part with this area in solar one we need to get in there to essentially construct the wall. The flood wall in that area, and because this, the new solar one project, is sort of influx at the moment, not having a con, confirmed or finalized project schedule and the contractor that just came on board. Profado they've been doing their homework, they're kind of getting ahead of the game, and the plan was to get them in and out of that area as quickly as they can, so that whole area will be available for the second project for the solar one project that will come up whenever that is yeah. I'm just looking to see if anybody can advocate for and getting the whole ended so that this entire northerly segment can be completed as originally anticipated to make it available to the public for recreation use when the southern half of the park do not agree to speak to destruction. What's that, were you going to speak? I'm sorry you're looking around, I was, I think, yeah. So the idea is that the we thought that solar one was going to build a structure next to the existing one. So we wanted to complete the flood wall within the first year of construction so that they could finish their design and build their build their building as it stands, we're going to attempt to accommodate any utilities that might go through our wall, so that way they build their building whenever it is in the future right. But to answer your question on what whether that area would be available, it's going to become a construction site for a new building at some point, but I do not think we know when so trying to find that out. Working with you know, DDC and EDC working together to try to coordinate that with the closures that are in this contract. We are we're going to close half of Stockholm Park at a time, so half will be available and then and then they flip to the other half, which is where the new park will be open. So it's a good question. The other question is: how do we deal with all of the landscaping? That's going to happen around the solar one building if it stays and stays where it is? So when do you when you do that and then say? Okay, we do not know when the new building is going to come. So we want to. We want to put in amenities in that area. So that's a good question in terms of input on how we face the park, we included suggested construction, phasing which is half the park at a time. But if there's a if there's one half that we want to keep open, you know longer, you know, that's something that you know we would. We would welcome input from the community because I do not know I mean I've walked the park. I do not know which part is the part you want to keep open longer or would rather have it finished first and open, but we're at the point now where that discussion can take place because it's not dictated in the construction documents, but we are going to tell them do the north par first or the south part he's going to suggest something that we need to approve. So I do not know if there's an answer to that, but it's it makes sense to split it down. The middle at 20th street and do half of it at a time. So, okay, great, thank you John. I think that's something we'll be discussing with you in the near future, so we'll go ahead and take one last question from Anne and we're going to move the agenda and floor is yours. Thank you Larry. So this is really just a follow- up, because I had not realized that the I knew the funding was there for the new building. I had not realized that the construction had been put on pause and the sequencing of this is so important. I have to say I was trying to take notes on what you were saying about this and I feel like there was no there like. There was no answer and I think you know there's nobody here from Udc who has more control over this than probably any of us would really like, but I think it behooves us as a community board and as a committee to make sure that we do that. We really keep the pressure up to make sure that the construction and the sequencing remains the same so that we do not have a double head on the very limited amount of open space that this community and especially waterfront that this community board has. So I hope that you know John and your you know. Colleagues here are hearing us loud and clear that this is not something we just want you to come back like come back next week next month and tell us like oh yeah, we're going to have another answer on this next month like this is really important, so it more of a comment than a question I know, but I think I'm saying what everyone's thinking right: yeah Adam, I just can't just clarify one very small piece of that, and I just want to make sure everybody does not misinterpret what I what I was just saying earlier, that I was just saying. As at DDC and our agency, a number of our projects went on a temporary pause, not this project. Our construction is not on pause, we're moving forward as we had planned the as John mentioned. There was a suggested schedule, suggested phasing plan that now the contractor is reviewing and submitting their final plan to us for our approval. So all everything is in motion and happening. I think that's with regards to the. I do understand that I'm really referring more to the pause of the construction for the solar one building and making sure that this sequencing is in place and what I think the board and the committee need to do is really make sure that you know not just everybody here, but that the city knows that we do not like this like this needs to keep moving forward. It can't, I know, there's a lot of budget re- juggling now, but as Larry says, this is already paid for we need to keep it on the right priorities. Okay got it. Yes, yeah just wanted to make sure I figured that's what you were. You were saying, but yeah I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page sounds good. Molly has her hand raised and after that, we're going to we're going to move the agendas the next time. Okay yeah. I just wanted to clarify. So thank you Ann for restating that very clearly and Q, and I hope that you're all talking with EDC is that correct. There is some coordination with solar, one and you're talking about everybody's talking on a weekly basis, almost three four times a week. Yes, because, like all city agencies and the elected officials, we all need to be talking because exactly what Ann said it needs to be it's a priority and it you know it does not make sense to have them be separate, and I know it's not a DDC issue. It sounds like it's more EDC and funding and those types of things, but it really is you know it just. It makes sense that they're urgently, like kind of requesting our help, and we want to help so whatever we can do, but it just makes sense to coordinate those efforts and there is some urgency there. So no absolutely and we're approaching sort of the beginning of this construction phase, which means a lot of the details and information is becoming available almost on a daily basis. Up until this moment, everything was proposed schedule draft plan and, as we move forward, our coordination will get tighter and tighter. Obviously, this is a much bigger group coordination effort with EDC with our colleagues at City, Hall and Mayor's office with solar ones, friends and colleagues, so there's a bigger group coordination that we have been having with the city agencies behind the scene and now that we're moving forward into construction, it's going to get tighter as well, so now that we have more concrete information from the from the contractor moving forward all right. Thank you. Thank you very much to the esker team for present for this presentation. Thank you for the answers. Thank you for your time. If you guys, when you get a chance to send sort of the the bike routing mitigation, that would be great. We look forward to sort of seeing you guys next month, we'll be in close contact with the board to kind of help shape what we're hoping to see as a committee for when you present to us in November. So with that, thank you and we're going to go and move on to the third item, which is a discussion about the waterfront. You know which Ann and molly talked about. You know it's a critical resource. You know it's under. That's goes without saying you know it's the land use and Waterfront committee and so kind of pivoting from ESCR. You know one of the big things that you know we've sort of been championing here in Mali, specifically and sort of how do we activate our waterfront space? You know there's a lot of it right now. You know the what comes to mind. Is the water club, the coned, the Con Edison, pier waterside, pier whatever we want to call it and other elements along that stretch. You know that receive heavy use, I'm not sure if you've been on it lately, but it seems like pedestrian access, joggers, bikers, etc is much higher than what it's been. You know in years past again, this is anecdotal and also it's warmer outside than in years past, but still this is a critical amenity for our community, a community that has starved for open space. You know and sort of how do we sort of preserve that during the important escrow project you know, and how do we expand upon it going forward, and so earlier this week I sent around some photos of a giant sinkhole, that's sort of emerged in the 34th street exit off of the Fdr gene brought this to our attention so to Molly. I went out and saw it for myself. You could fit a golf cart. You know it's pretty sizable and it's and there's been a significant sort of rerouting of the exit from through the water club and what's interesting about this, is that you know you see sort of just sort of the space. That is just what are what are we doing here? Is there a better use for this space, as opposed to sort of an empty parking lot, for you know, is there something? Is there something better for that, and so with that said, you know one of the things I just want to kind of just I do not want to spend too much time on. I just kind of just want to plant the seed for sort of future action with this committee, as we start to think you know, they're going to be critical investments along the waterfront in terms of what do we do, you know how do we better prepare ourselves for resiliency efforts north of the ESCR, what happens to when the fdr reaches the end of its critical life? You know based on the sinkhole and based on underneath the pass in between glick and the and the service road it's already there, and so, as governments start to sort of make those large those large decisions. What can we do to advocate? You know for bigger and better things that serve us instead of just potentially just the status quo, because we're talking about billions of dollars of investment, so sorry for the Soliloquy, but molly did you want to add to that or speak to anything of this? Well yeah? You know I was actually just I'm going to mention. I I've mentioned this already to all of you, but October 28th. So next, so this Wednesday- it's already coming up so quickly Wednesday evening at six o'clock, we're doing a a meeting led sponsored by rebuild by design and led by that group. But it's the community boards, six, three, two I'm creating four one and four. So it's the whole. You know ESCR lmcr group and we've been talking monthly and what they want to just it's a really great presentation that rebuild put together with the city, so the junior Bavishi from the mayor's Office of Resiliency will be speaking and you know showing the whole connectivity, but so they asked us to just talk about and I'll just you know be brief at this meeting. It's not me talking that much, but just lessons learned- and I think our lesson learned is what we talked about just tonight on. This call is a mitigation, and you know heads and bike mitigation, but also park mitigation that they promised us. You know, and they have this flyover bridge. That would be amazing. If that actually happens, it's apparently, you know, has a dollar amount fund funding amount put to it already: 50 million dollars or 53 million dollars. But when we're talking about our waterfront it, you know the ESCR stops at 24th street, so north of 24th. You know, I think, some of the hospitals. I texted Sandra earlier just to kind of remind myself that maybe someone here can say the bellevue: do they have a resiliency plan in place? I know the Va Hospital. Has these large walls that they've already put up Nyu langone? Is you know, do they have a resiliency in place now? I think they do, but we have that sinkhole atom, but we also have three other sinkholes north. So they're, you know in a two three block area of our waterfront. The infrastructure is crumbling, so there are yeah. There are all these issues around our waterfront, so ESCR and then again above 24th. So we just need to be cognizant of all these issues and we need a master plan. We need something a big idea, so we should really be starting to talk about that. I know we are. You know with the water club it's a 10-year lease still for this abandoned restaurant on our waterfront. They have 10 more years with this EDC lease and it's just an empty building and parking lot. Thank goodness! It's there! Now we have, you know, there's rerouting of the exit the fdr traffic there, but it's we have a lot of challenges, so we need to really start thinking about what we want to see on our waterfront. So that's all there's so much more of it great. Thank you, molly and again, to remind everybody. I believe cody sent out the invite for that discussion for Wednesday night. So if you have not signed up for it, I highly encourage you to do so. Molly is a panelist, but also it's a very interesting topic and I think there's a lot of great lessons learned. So we'll do Larry and then we'll do Ann Larry. I just drove by that problem area on the Fdr drive near 34th Street in the I could not see what the cause of it was. Does anybody know if it was a broken sewer, main or or what DEP? I think gene talked to them and I talked to them the guys out there working on it and they just said they were there trying to investigate. They did not give me a lot of information that was Friday when I spoke with them. I do not know if jeans or someone's talked to them since, but I know D.O.T and DEP are investigating, and so you know I was just saying open it up by end of day or tomorrow get it open. You know, because it's quite dangerous what they've done with this rerouting, but you know it's. It sounds like it's going to take several days or you know I do not know, but they're not telling us what the issue is so as of today, I have not heard unless anyone else has heard it's been. It's DEP, that's there on site. You know, I do not know gene, I do not know. If he's, maybe he stepped away for his name. His name is yeah and yeah. I just want to say I joined this board because of my concerns about the waterfront access and like the fact that we are basically like the last part of Manhattan and much of the city to have access, especially I live on 46th street, so it's even in Zebra, and that makes me think about the Un and I think in our big picture thinking I know. Basically, they have historically not been the best of neighbors, but I think, if we're going to think big, we really need to think about how we might engage them. I mean, if we're thinking about past the Fdr drive in a temporal sense. We really need to include them, and so I just want to throw that out. I think I'm going to be able to make it on Wednesday, so you know I'll. You know I'll chime in good, okay. Well, thank you all. So, ideally, I think we can continue this discussion, but also you know to push further resolutions about specific items and also sort of sort of continue a push for a broader master plan for this. So you know it's ongoing as always, and I'm really hoping that you know these sorts of seeds, can you know Blossom, Fruit, etc. So thank you for that. So the second that so in the last adam yeah, please there's a a member of the public with a question. Do you want me to read it aloud right? I'm sorry, yeah! I think someone mentioned oh yeah. That was me the end it reached into his natural life. Could you clarify it as I have a timeline yeah, I'm sorry this I apologize for the jargony stuff. You know this is sort of a thing like within planning or in engineering and whatnot is that you know a structure has a useful life. Let's call it 30 years, 50 years et cetera, and then basically, you either have to keep repairing it or replace it, and so after that sort of that period of time. So basically there are some substantive construction that is going to have to take place of the Fdr as it continues to sort of age. So that's what that means. So sorry for that, I we have a habit of urban planners engineers. Et cetera being very jargony, so thank you for calling us out on that, so we just have to speak italian English, sometimes so all right. So the fourth item again, this is just sort of this- is sort of a broad sort of point. This is just a discussion of humanitarian inclusionary housing in community district six. You know, Sandy brought this to our attention and sort of having a kickoff of like what does this mean here in the district and so that sort of evolved in sort of discussing with the various chairs of you know. How do we sort of coordinate our efforts with both housing and with the 197A you know from land use in terms of mandatory inclusionary housing? You know the angle. The lens that I personally see is one of what does development look like in our district in the next six year, five years and then sort of what MIH is included within that specifically, a big topic. That's going to come up is the Soho Noho rezoning, which there's a meeting occurring right now. Our DCP reps are there to engage in sort of the first. I think one of the many outreach efforts underneath like sort of so that process is basically just starting and actually Kavitha. Is there too, to sort of gather information for the committee, and so one of the big things you know going forward is sort of how can we sort of coordinate our efforts and our resources amongst the committees to sort of tackle this very important issue? I know there's a lot of overlap. I know there's a lot of people on this committee who are on the other committees, and so how can we all sort of you know tackle this important issue together? You know basically sandy. Would you like to add anything to that no other than I was really hoping. We could get some sort of a presentation on Nih, because I know it is confusing and what potential sites there are in our community, because my understanding is, it is always associated with every zoning, so we're going to try and gather some more information and make this one of the it's just one way to achieve. You know more housing in our district, so it's one of the tools and we like I just like to know more about it: okay, all right, and so with that. I think that concludes all of the items on the actual on the agenda itself. In terms of bulleted items, the chairs, let's see yeah MIH, all right, it's the chairs report, for you. You've listened to sort of my soliloquies for the last two items. So I'll be brief. Here, molly forwarded to us, the Grand Central partnership was advocating for the continued use of the Park Avenue Malls north of Grand Central, and so this sort of piggy backs off of the presentation that was given to us last week in terms of the large grand central train shed, that is being reconstructed by a whole host of parties and essentially they were advocating for sort of their continues, but also their expansion. You know which you might remember some presentations from the Midtown East freezoning. You know several years ago, where D.O.T proposed some interesting and really cool uses for the pedestrian malls for the for the malls themselves and sort of how to activate them for the Park Avenue and for the city as a whole. Molly did you want to speak to any of that you're good there again, hi, no, not really the Grand Central partnership just asked. If we would sign on to support a letter and support to send to DOT- and I you know, I think you were all in a very positive about- we want to support them at CB5- it's not in our community board, but obviously it affects all of us. We'd have more open space and you know with all the their park plans for those islands are really quite beautiful and then I know Adam. Your big idea was like and then maybe eventually someday south of 42Nd Street on in Park Avenue is CB6. So we could, you know, maybe envision future something different, how we would treat our park Avenue and our islands in the middle there, our mall, what are their, I guess, they're called malls, or I do not know he calls them malls, but yeah. So I mean if we, if I think, if you're, okay, I we would just sign sign on to the letter, there's no need for a resolution just a letter in support of their plan. Yeah right mean that works for me, and that will be one of the last letters of support right that you'll get to sign yeah. That's it. I think that's a good sort of a nice piece of to go out with a bang if you will so excellent all right. Well, thank you, molly! So, in terms of old new business larry, you brought up an item about support of solar one. I think that that's a good idea- and I think maybe this is something we want to continue. We might want to explore in a resolution you know another meeting I was. I was going to suggest that we do that now. In light of the timing on this project and if there's going to be a delay till next month, that might be too late, okay, molly or do you have? Do you have more contacts in terms of the meetings that occurred with each other? I'm glad that Cube did say they were coordinating with EDC, because EDC said well, we need to talk to them. It was- and I think, Chris Collins, I'm not sure his title, the executive director at solar one. He was you know alarmed they were they had kind of come. You know onto the site already and started doing work that anyway, there was there's some lack of communication in the just in the last several weeks. So it sounds like they are all speaking now and maybe you know who knows there are a lot of different stakeholders so but yeah Larry, I agree, we should probably do it. I could I could write. I could write a resolution urging that the that the hold that's been put on the construction of this solar one project the be lifted and that that go ahead as originally planned- and I think our ask is EDC- is his elected officials. I think they think there's some funding. There's some funding issues, not just a Covid-19 pause. I think there's some. You know it's bigger than that. So there are. There are some issues, but it should happen all at the same time right. The this ESCR project should just move forward and reconfigure the whole park, and then you know a year or two later: tear it down again and build the solar one. It does not make sense yeah and particularly in light of the fact that they're going to do all this landscaping, which will have to be destroyed in order to do the construction of the new building, makes no sense, and I'm not entirely sure, based upon the representations that solar one made at the meeting last week, that there are substantive issues on the funding. Okay, all right so larry. What would what would? What would a resolution? Look? What do we want? Well, I think it really is upon information and belief that, based upon representations of solar one- and maybe I should reach out to Chris Collins, to just confirm what I thought I heard a they have represented, that they have full funding for the project b, they're supposed to build their new building in coordination with the construction of the the flood wall that is accelerated to the beginning of the project and C. This would be for the good of the community, because, when the northern end of the park can be returned to service for the construction on the southern end, that there won't be an open construction site and those other issues about tearing up what had already been done in the way of landscaping in order to facilitate a later construction of solar of the solar one building. Okay, and so I moved that, and we support the the lifting of the of the of the temporary hold on construction. Okay, lou you're on mute lou. If you just hold down your space bar, you can unmute yourself for the duration. Sorry about that, is there a possibility? We could, is there a time pressure on this, or could we hold this till November and have solar one come in and give us a fuller and more authoritative recitation? I personally am not opposed to that. My impression is that you know in terms of the fact that the construction on the the wall is going to begin, let's say in November that does not preclude solar one coming in next month and I could go either way, but I do think that if this is not resolved, we ought to have a resolution. I think inviting solar one to come to the November meeting and giving a full up to the minute recitation would probably be in the best interests of accuracy and completeness yeah. I would agree with that Sandy. I was just going to say that I believe there is some redesign that will be going on to obtain the budget numbers that they're looking for. So it may be even more of a time issue if they do not start immediately, it means they will lag behind. I agree sandy. There is a big time issue there. It can't wait to hold another month to come before the board, and I there are some. You know you I larry. If you know Chris, he would be happy to talk and I'm sure Councilmember powers and his office are very aware of the issue. So maybe it's a call with you know Adam and the a few folks on the committee and those other stakeholders. It's there is an EDC in lupin EDC. I do not know if there you could have another separate meeting with the committee or how that, if you know if Lou wants to be involved, but I mean I think that there's definitely some urgency here, not until you can't really wait till the end of November. So I guess I guess what we can do is that we can organize. We can organize another meeting with solar. Well, we'll solar one will obviously take the meeting we'll, but will the other parties be able to join in before full board? I mean that's sort of the question right. So are you suggesting that we have a special meeting of the committee with solar one? I I think, if you just talk, if you just talk to Chris Collins and somebody from council member power's office, they'll have all the information, but I did I did not want to you know. If someone else on the committee wants to join, I mean I do not want to complicate it, but it you know. If you're looking to write a resolution, I think they have all the pieces and will fisher at EDC. I'm sure he would be happy to join they're all very familiar with the issue, and can you know educate you on that? I'm sorry Sandy did you want to speak and then and sorry I volunteer Larry to work with you on this, because I think it's a very we have. We have to move it forward because it's not instantaneously, okay, so we'll. I think what we need to do is we need to have a second for the resolution and a vote second and seconded okay is so second and so all in I guess all in support of Larry's resolution to advocate for Larry. Could you could you properly phrase it? I know that there was a lot. I know, in short, it's support of solar one, but what are sort of like the well in support of lifting the hold on construction so that it may go forward the for the new solar one building in coordination with the construction of the flood wall by DDC as part of this eastside resiliency project right so in support of lifting okay all right, so I think cody. We should probably do a roll call of this, so we'll go ahead and into a roll call, and then I guess Larry and I will we'll think about it. What if we just do a non and a objection? If there's an objection, is there any objection to the resolution as proposed? I'm sorry Lou, I'm going to abstain on this. Okay, all right. Anyone else seeing none resolution passes. Jim joined us late, so that's probably 10 0 1 right cody we've got 11 in favor one. Oh, no, sorry, you're, right! Okay! I my math is bad. It was technical issues. It was not. Yes, absolutely also Jim. You missed compliment at the beginning, so so good to have you. It looks like there were technical, their technical Intros I'll be sure to catch it on the YouTube channel wonderful. So we will work on Larry myself and the board will work on crafting resolution, we'll present that to you before full board and then also we'll work on or the office and myself will work on to make sure that everybody gets the email with the invite before the next meeting. So with that said, do I have a motion to Adjourn? Do not move yep? Do you want to just say that a majority of the members responded to the doodle for the date for next month? Oh right, yes, absolutely so anyway. Thank you all for responding to cody's doodle we're coming up to close to Thanksgiving. I know it's always really tricky and I think almost all the respondents, except for maybe me, so it was only a me problem- all vote in favor keeping the next language meeting for the 23rd. Yes, okay, great, wonderful, okay! So again, thank you for that. Thank you, cody! So see you all so with that said, do I have a motion to Adjourn yep? Second excellent meeting adjourned. Thank you all see some of you Wednesday all right. Thank you thanks Adam. Thank you. Good night have a good night bye. Everyone.
