I look forward to authoring this resolution and support Everyone stay safe, be Let's move to item number two, which is the standing item in our committee, which is an update on the eastside coastal resiliency project.
So Most of you familiar with the four projects right now we're just about to enter construction on the first project, Pa2 in the north, from 15th street to 25th street, and then we have the pa1, which is the Big East River Park Further south.
The thing we want to note on this slide is that the park's going to remain open for all 2020 Then, obviously, when it gets done, it's done in phases so that at least about half the park is open at all times for the public to use.
It has a general timeline of the projects as we anticipate them And then the other kind of items that we have mentioned, which are progressing forward and also especially as I just wanted to note that we do have a community advisory group meeting next well, on November 5th is the next one.
It shows all the parks open since the escrow project has not yet started, but once the construction starts, we're going to be coordinating with the DDC web team to make sure that our interactive map tool shows you know, Which parks are closed and where you can go So we're definitely happy to come back next month and give a more comprehensive update on that sort of recreation aspect of like what happens during construction.
I know we heard from them at our last meeting that they were not sure of the timing of the construction.
We build the wall on the West side and then just from the north, when Steichov Park gets closed further south right, so we'll make sure that the we accommodate solar ones operation.
I'm just wondering how much of that area gets closed down for the construction, we'll have to work that out with with our contractor, for their operations and and with solar one, because they have to be able to use that building and get to it to continue operating Everybody has to go all the way over like way like off, like everybody, all bikes and pedestrians, and come back up on like 21st street right.
I'm wondering if anyone can put up the plan for how to reroute around the solar one construction site that you're going to start working on how you're going to reroute, bicyclists and pedestrians through that area, it will be rerouted.
Last week, I attended a meeting of the Stuyvesant Cove park, association, which was attended by representatives from solar one, and they mentioned the the sequencing of the construction of the wall, but they also pointed out that the the city, whether it was DDC or or another entity dealing with budget, has put the brakes on their constructing their building, even though it's fully funded, and it did not seem to make any sense to them, and I-wanted to alert the Community Board to that that issue It's a particular concern, I think, to the community.
The construction on solar one is delayed for a significant period after the retaining wall or the flood wall that is being erected next to it, has been completed to get solar one completed and open up that whole area of the park as the work proceeds down to the southern end of the park, I think, is a very important imperative and the the folks at the city who need to green light solar one, have to have to understand that.
Very much want to put on entertainment during the summer in parts of the park where construction is not scheduled for next summer, maybe toward 20th street there's a little area where it opens up, and so please be in touch with them and help to facilitate that.
I do not have any other questions about the sequencing of the construction, but I do want to ask you about security and whether you're going to have cameras and the like to prevent theft in the lay down areas, and also the the possibility that you might have encampments growing up as the currently is a homeless encampment at the south entrance to Stuyvesant cove park at Avenue, Scene, East, 18Th, Street, and and certainly we want to discourage that sort of activity which could be a hazard and also present some security issues.
I do want to see if you have any kind of a reaction or a response to the the idea that the sequencing of this project in terms of currently the south end of Stuyvesant cove park, is being made available for public use, with the idea that the construction will be completed all aspects including solar one before they have to close down the southern end If that remains basically an open sore, then none of the park will be available, and The park is phased.
The flood wall in that area, and because this, the new solar one project, is sort of influx at the moment, not having a con, confirmed or finalized project schedule, and the contractor that just came on board.
But to answer your question on what whether that area would be available, it's going to become a construction site for a new building at some point, but I do not think.
I do not know, which part is the part you want to keep open longer or Would, rather have it finished first and open, but we're at the point now where that discussion can take place, because it's not dictated in the construction documents, but we are going to tell them do the north par first or the south part He's going to suggest something that we need to approve.
I do understand that I'm really referring more to the pause of the construction for the solar one building and making sure that this sequencing is in place and what I think the board and the committee need to do-is really make sure that you know not just everybody here, but that the city knows that we do not like this, like this needs to keep moving forward.
We, look forward to sort of seeing you guys next month, we'll be in close contact with the board to kind of help shape what we're hoping to see as a committee for when you present to us in November.
How do we sort of preserve that during the important escrow project you know, and how do we expand upon it going forward?
With this committee, As, we start to think you know, they're, going to be critical investments along the waterfront in terms of what do we do, you know: how do we better prepare ourselves for resiliency efforts north of the ESCR?
You, know onto the site already and started doing work that anyway, there was I could write a resolution urging that the that the hold that's been put on the construction of this solar one project the be lifted and that that go ahead as originally I think they think there's some funding.
This ESCR project should just move forward and reconfigure the whole park, and then you know a year or two later: tear it down again and build the solar one.
Yeah, and particularly in light of the fact that they're going to do all this landscaping, which will have to be destroyed in order to do the construction of the new building, makes no sense, and I'm not entirely sure, based upon the representations that solar one made at the meeting last week, that there are substantive issues on the funding.
My impression is that you know in terms of the fact that the construction on the the wall is going to begin, let's say in November that does not preclude solar one coming in next month.
But what are sort of like the well in support of lifting the hold on construction so that it may go forward the for the new solar one building in coordination with the construction of the flood wall by DDC as part of this eastside resiliency project right so in support of lifting Is there any objection to the resolution as proposed?
