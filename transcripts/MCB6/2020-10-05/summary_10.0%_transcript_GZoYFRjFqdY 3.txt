The agenda for tonight's meeting was distributed ahead of time by the board office and appears on the screen before you.
You see the my proposal is to extend the as you see the curve, a little bit like projecting from Fdr, so people come here, Perusian comes here And, then the car driver.
Your sign is just green, but you never know This is from the street Sorry Pedestrian side, the yellow cab, and that blue car is approaching.
If this red thing, I do not know the color right now, but this is extended a little bit so car automatically recognize it and then slow, down.
I think that the committee members can definitely agree that this needs a serious upgrade It's another project to put online to get DOT to study the area we've been pushing for them to do something about this for years with no success, And so if this is a way to get them moving when the money comes.
I was there like about probably two minutes after they got hit by a car trying to cross from the river the Riverside there, And I actually ran and got police from the ferry to bring them this.
This space is not It's about safety, and Last time we looked at, for example, another infrastructure project with like a nice bridge, which I think is gene, said it's very nice to plan.
And I think maybe that's exacerbated if you're trying to funnel the you know kind of all of the traffic into a central entrance and exit, and while I agree, it definitely improves the sight lines You know kind of fuller, design.
I, just also wanted to add a comment just to say that, in terms of what was mentioned earlier about potential occupation of the space and encampments, I think that our priorities are to design a space that is functional for the public and try not to get mixed up in anti- patterns and hostility.
Members Park and I actually have to tell you, because I do not spend a lot of time at that part of the of our community.
So I would actually record recommend that we do a resoluting that we do the issues of great park and deal with the safety, the lighting and make it a community park.
If there's any interim or upcoming projects for this particular area, and I, will let the community board know, And, I, think colleen with that conversation.
If, there's anything that can be added like immediately to help this situation, because a lot of the chats and questions are- It's, a dangerous situation, So Oh, yeah, I, know one constituent is advocating for a speed hump in the area, for example, just to give a taste of one of the types of safety improvements that are on people's minds.
So I'm, not sure if that's you know, writing a resolution to request more speed cameras or to support Brad Poyleman's act, which also extends the use of them on the weekends and outside of school hours.
I'm, pretty sure that we did write a resolution in the past asking more cameras, and I think the issue really is that we just need many more cameras in the district And, if I recall, I think we are limited by the state.
You want people to stop, speeding, They, actually make people slow, down, and I guess- I mean they create tickets for some people and the city maybe will make money right, but I think that if we want like enforcement of or make people slow down, you know I think I really think that's probably more of a police visibility matter like When you see the New York City Highway Patrol out on like, that's a very visible deterrent for people, I'm, just I'm, just closing like.
Okay, I see a member of the public, wants to speak on this issue and has some kind of antidotal information, so Last year, Second Avenue was so busy that I almost died on a crosswalk being crushed by an MTA bus.
Cameras, work, it's been proven, and the question is simply that we are literally seeing people getting hit every single week in Second Avenue, and enough is enough We really need those cameras and just to the point, there is a parked cop car on 39th and second regularly cars just speed by it.
They asked if one could be installed, there, but I think the issue was that we want them.
I wanted to make a motion that we do a resolution that asks for both speed, but I mean the previous one was for red light.
Okay, so molly offered to write the resolution It seems like there's some easily googleable information that could support you, but I think Colleen might be able to help as well.
That was what I wanted to comment, so that is mostly direct, Amazon and fresh direct, and you know unloading It's just free parking for a lot of people It's not used for traffic, so The St Martin's park , it's our Parks Committee, is dealing with the whole redesign of the park.
You know truly like a nicer activated space there rather than just a street.
A member of the public wanted to speak on this issue.
I. Think some members of the public have some questions.
Be the first meeting with public safety added to the name of this committee.
