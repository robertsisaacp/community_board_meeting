And I appreciate you guys, but I you know I'm willing to do it if you need it. So that's all I was going to say yeah. That was awesome, so I can take them. If you know what I'll take the minutes, do them yeah I just offered myself. So that's not forcing me thank you and, as always, you know you can kick him to me. Not as always. This is my first day as chair, but you can kick it to me and I. Can you know do anything that needs to be done to it to make sure it's in good form, no worries. Brandon. Can you send me I? Guess the list of all the attendees yeah I can do that. I can do that and send the minutes template as well. Thank you very much. I will now go and mute and the recording has started, and so has the YouTube live stream. So Kevin you can feel free to start the meme. Whenever you'd like great welcome to the December 1st meeting of the CB6 parks, landmarks and Cultural Affairs Committee that committee name may change I see our CB6 chair. Kyle is on board and maybe that's something that we'd love for him actually to address later. If we get the chance, my name is Kevin O'keefe and I am the chair of the committee. This is the first meeting that I am cheering. The meeting is called to order at 7:05 pm tonight we are joined by community associate Brendan Birth. Now, members of the public, you can raise any questions or comments that you have through the Zoom Q&A feature.

So please keep your questions and committee comments. Succinct and Germaine to the discussion tonight's agenda. First up is certificate of appropriateness for 238, East 15th street, to restore the front facade as well as to have a new rooftop addition to an existing townhouse. We would love our presentation, who will be making that presentation? Yes, I will and if you could state your name for the record. Yes, my name is Katarone, I'm the architect for the project at 238, East, 15th street. I'm also here with my partner David, who who's attending as well hi, David you're muted. By the way. So can we start the presentation now? Is it you may yeah, okay, we're looking about what five minutes or so is that yeah we'll make it quick? Okay, can you hear me now I? Did it? Yes? Okay! Thank you! Okay! So, basically, as you mentioned, this project has two aspects: one is the facade restoration and the other is a repetition, just quickly go over it. So this is the 1940 tax photograph and basically, what we're doing this is. What's there now and we're going to restore all of these original window surrounds we're going to replace the existing aluminum windows that are there now and put back into place wood windows of historical character, and we will point the facade, the brick facade and, let's see and we'll restore the existing cornice. So those are the basic elements the street facade. It's another view. This is the location within this. The Stuyvesant historic district, we're really literally right across from Davidson Park. This is the our building within the block diagram. These are just aerial views. To give you a better sense, Stuyvesant park literally across the street. This is the premises is looking the other way. This is a the street elevation just to give more context. There are some surrounding townhouses and then some other post-war buildings on the block and a church on the corner. The plot plan- and this is the outline of the roof edition that we're going to propose. Okay, this is the front elevation, the street elevation and, in addition to the street, facade restoration. This is the roof edition that we are proposing and I just want to point out. One aspect: the existing windows at the top floor are have been squared off and aluminum windows inserted within these originally arched windows. So we're going to restore the arch as well as restoring the surrounding the window surround details. One thing we are going to propose is to raise the window height just on the top floor by about 12 inches, so that that's one subtle change that we're proposing on the street facade the roof edition. Is it's basically a simple rectangular box with the elevator bulkhead, it will be clad in zinc, primarily cable wire guide rails up on top. Let's see it's just a rendering of what we're proposing just one more thing about the windows, so all the historic photographs that we found so far show a one over one configuration. So that's what we're showing in our proposal. However, the staff at landmarks has mentioned that it may have been actually a four over two or two over two configuration, so we're just going we're basically coordinating with the staff members on that and whatever they feel is the most historic window type. That's what we'll end up putting in so just give some information on that. This is the rear facade. It's the existing rears facade is basically painted brick and we're just going to repaint the brick there and zoom in and then we're adding the roof edition again. This is the zinc glad box, basically and on the lower levels, the parlor floor, we're introducing french style windows or doors basically and on the lowest level, we're going to introduce these sliding glass doors that will connect with the backyard. This is a rendering of what we're posing. This is kind of what is there now society elevation? This is the roof plan. So what's there now is basically some steel damage with old HVAC equipment and an old elevator bulkhead and some skylights. So what we're going to introduce is the roof edition with a new HVAC equipment above this is the elevator bulkhead, and this is a skylight to an atrium down below it's a demolition plan. This is the old elevator bulkhead this section and we are also proposing in the backyard. This is probably the best diagram for that, so we're going to propose its excavation partially of the backyard to meet with the lower level of the building. So this section is starting to show that this is a rendering of the roof edition from both the front and the back. So this gives you an idea, three dimensionally. This is basically a diagram showing where all the photos were taken, but I can explain what sorry. According to our survey, we can not see the roof edition from across the street. It's not visible, however, because we are fortunate enough to be in front of this park if we do actually walk into the park. The addition is viewable is visible in some vantage points, so just go through each photo one by one, so this is a little bit into the park. We still can't see anything at this point also here this is a little bit into the park. This is a little bit further back and you can start to see if you really look carefully you'll see the elevator bulkhead peek out a little bit here, that's what that is, and there it's probably the roof edition may be visible as you go further away, if you know probably in the winter, when there are no leaves during most of the year when the trees are full. It's you know it's not that visible. So that's- and this is now looking from 2nd, Avenue and 15th. So this is 2nd avenue in 15th street. This is that church down the street so again very difficult to really. At this vantage point, you can't really see anything. Yeah I think you have to go further back really to be able to here. If you go back, maybe a full block east of Second Avenue and you squit your eyes. You you'll be able to see a little bit here, let's see and here as well so again, gotta really zoom in most of our roof edition is actually hiding behind this stair bulkhead of this neighboring building. So it's not very visible and here's just a few additional photos from the park again a little bit deeper into the park. I think it may be slightly visible in certain vantage points here, just a little bit. If you really zoom in there's a little bit here of the mock-up you can see- and this is the actual mock-up itself. So it's fully built with the new elevator bulkhead and from various angles so, and this is a view from the rear yard- and you can see a little bit of it here- here's a zoomed version of that the rear facade of the roof edition is set back three feet from the face of the rear wall, and this is the just existing conditions of the entry area which will remain in place. This is actually something we filed with the year with the community board a number of years ago to put in a handicap ramp and we're just going to keep that the way it is it's just more details of the windows. These are the historic photos, more details of the windows that we're storing in the front. The back will keep we'll replace the existing aluminum windows with new double hung, aluminum windows for the most part and here's a few photos of the existing rear facade, and this is the what we're proposing to excavate. So we're going to excavate, maybe half level down on the backyard where this hatch, roughly where this hatch portion is- and this is a rendering of something we're proposing for the back I mean. That's it that's David, anything you want to add or yeah I think from our end. This is what we're proposing. Thank you very much. Thank you for a presentation committee. Members. If you have any questions, you could certainly indicate by a raised hand and while we're waiting for any questions, I believe this was the catholic sisters of the immaculate heart. Is this the same town house? Yes, the they were actually our clients many years ago and then the building was sold to someone else in the week all right. So now we have a new client. All right. Congratulations did they place any restrictions on in what could be done? Was there anything any clauses that you're concerned about during part of that sale or did you I mean we're not aware of any restrictions? I mean the building use will be changed, the Cfo is being amended and it will be changed to convert from a convent to a residential building right. As far as we know, I know, there's glass, stained windows and other some other very unique features and those are still there. Those will stay. There are some in the back. There was some but to our knowledge, they're, not his like. Historically, you know part of the building. It was something that was put in by the convent. Much later. Let's see I think we might have a photo here but yeah. This is this window here. Oh there we go, yeah I think it's hard to see, but these two windows had some stained glass. But again these were not really original to the building, understood, I, understand I, don't see any Brendan, no I started to interrupt, but I do see. A few community members have their hands raised. I see, Jeanne Dinovio has her hand raised. Oh there we go I. Thank you for the presentation. Just two quick questions. One did I see in the slides that there's going to be a pool in store installed in the basement level. Yes, there will be a swimming pool, fascinating the seller in a seller. Okay. That was part of your. Is that why you need to do some excavation outside of the building? That's right, yeah I mean this yeah. The swimming pool is going to be here, and this is the excavation okay, but you know the rear yard. Excavation is something it wasn't really. The reason why you know the swimming pool was not the reason why we did this excavation. Our excavation was really to connect the rear yard into the space yeah okay indoors and outdoors and I see you've done a lot of studies on views from the streets and whether or not it can be seen from the park and all that do you also do studies from the buildings nearby from the residents who live in the building next door. Does that do you have any renderings of that or how that will affect the views of any of the buildings next door or behind I know the park is great, but well I mean basically we're our the neighbors that we're facing on the other side of the rear yard, they're, basically, buildings that are facing 14th street and a lot of them are at least some of them are commercial in nature, but this is probably because we don't have access to our neighbors yard, but this is kind of what it might look like from the back. Okay says that would be in effect the tallest building on that, in that section it won't be I thought there was an apartment building like right next door, that was, there is an apartment, building, just one door down. Let me show you the photo. Ah here we go so this is our building here, and this is that big apartment building here so except for these four town houses, the rest of the block is really just these big apartment buildings. Okay, thank you and I, see that Mark Thompson has his hand raised mark yeah thanks. It's good to see you guys back as the address from a few years ago. I was like oh great. We knew you were going to come back and do something with us. That's great. Just one quick question is the rooftop edition. Is that just a bulkhead for the elevator or what's the use up there? No, it will be a room, an occupiable living. You know a room for the residents so for the roof: terrace yeah. Okay, that's fine! Yeah I! You know, I walked over I live right by here, so I walked a few times and it's you know difficult to see anything on the roof and I. Think that part of the problem is. There are too many trees in the park, which is great, but you know I, think you're, rendering a show that it's kind of hard to see. So that's a good thing, I think also just Genie for a quick point. Landmarks doesn't usually ask applicants for views from neighboring buildings. They just went from the street yeah. Thank you for that. I was I, didn't know, yeah. Maybe it's something that maybe they should be doing, but they don't. So it's really just from the public thoroughfare, so yeah, but thanks guys thanks, Mark Martin, Barrett, you're up okay, a couple of questions, any changes or cleaning up of the front door of the building is the say the rental is that the same as what it had been because the adjoining buildings are a little bit more developed so yeah, I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear clearly, but were you asking are we? Are you doing anything with the front door of the building like the door front door yeah? Is that what you're asking? Yes? Actually we are I forgot to point that out. Let me find the appropriate drawing here. We go so right now. The front door is it's kind of a little bit odd because you have these grand, you know porticos and whatnot, and then somebody's stuck in this small door. Obviously not historic, and what we're proposing to do is to put in a you know a more historically appropriate door. That's of the appropriate height I mean I. Think the other one was literally like a six foot. Eight door that they threw in so yeah. We want to restore the front door back to a more you know, historic condition. Was there any study done in regards to the new HVAC unit, that's being put on the top of the building in regards to sound and vibration? That would affect 240 east, so we are going to propose screening around the units and that will help to baffle the noise, and here we go so there will be screening all around here, and this is also adjacent to the 236 side, so it will be on the you know further away from before you thank you. Hi Kevin you're, on mute, yes, I am I, don't see any more questions to the committee, any public questions from the public. If not, we can move on and see. If anyone would like to make a motion I'll make a motion to accept is presented. We're doing this as support motion of support the application. This will be a motion of support. Okay. We will now take a vote on the motion of support by roll call. Okay, when I say your name, please say whether you are in favor are against, will abstain or abstain for cause. Kevin O'keefe in favor Jeanne D'onofrio in favor, Marty, Barrett, okay, Matt Bondi in favor and Tom Allner in favor Rajnayar in Favor, Ray Schmidt Patel in favor, Sean Sherman in Favor, Mark Thompson in favor, Ronnie, White, I, don't think Ronnie has joined Us Gary Pappush in favor. The resolution passes. Thank you for the presentation. We wish you the best of luck. This will go to the General Board meeting. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay, we're going to move on to a certificate of appropriateness for renovations at the let's house, at 211, East, 48th, street I. Think Alex and Wayne Correct will be making the presentation correct, Wayne, I think you're on mute, I, don't know if you want to take it Kevin real, quick, I apologize. This is Sean Sherman I was a couple of minutes late and I just wanted to make sure that I was supposed to take minutes. I want to make sure nobody else was assigned because I've been taking them, but I wanted to make sure we didn't have two people taking them. Yeah Sean thanks for jumping in and asking we covered a little bit. Rachel was volunteered, so she can pass you the baton. Actually, no, we jumped right. Sorry, we jumped a couple. People you can take over. The beauty is, of course, is this is on YouTube. We have a recording that glad to take over. Thank you very much. Thank you. Sorry! So Alex you're going to share your screen right, yeah, okay and we'll get started thanks, everybody for hearing us and hope this is interesting for you yeah all right. So does everyone see the screen yeah, all right so yeah good evening, just to introduce ourselves? My name is Alex Nitrikovsky and, along with Wayne Tourette, we're the architects for this property and we're also here representing the owner of the property, I'm going to apologize in advance for the length of the presentation going to try to be as quick as possible and kind of move through the slides. But as some of you likely know, this is a kind of unique property and there's a broad scope of work here. So understanding the different bits can be a little bit confusing just to kind of outline it for everybody. The proposed scope of work is for a rooftop addition, a rear facade extension and the lowering of the rear yard. There's also some exterior restoration work and an interior renovation scope, but I, don't think those are of the specific concern for this review so and of those items we've been coordinating and working with LPC on the exterior restoration work, so I'll touch on it briefly, but I won't go into too much detail unless there are specific questions. We've also been working with LPC on just understanding the history of this house. We've been trying to track down some of the original fabricators for it, and we've been working with the Lascaux Archive at Syracuse University to track down original drawings and articles and letters related to the house. So just as a quick overview for those of you who are not familiar, the property is located on the north side. Sorry on the north side of East 48th street, you can see it marked in red here. In the aerial view, you'll see that it's part of a row of townhouses in the middle of the block. It's bracketed by a large office tower to the West at Third Avenue and to a large apartment building at the eastern corner, and then here are two views showing the historic 1940s tax photo as well as the present day photo you'll see that not too much has changed between those two times. I'll give just a quick historic kind of background. So William Wiscons was one of a number of prominent European born architects in the early half of the 20th century, who moved to the Us and led to the spread of european influence modernism. Here this house is probably one of his most well-known works. It was this in a series of other townhouses that he did around Manhattan as well as a couple of early modern office buildings that he designed. So this particular house at 211, east 48th, was built by Las Cas, both as his own private residence as well as his architectural office, and it was an opportunity for him to design for his own needs, as well as to showcase his work to potential clients. Now, as you can see in these photos, which are from the 1930s architectural Forum issue, the house has a distinctly modern design, but the actual structure here dates back to the middle 1860s, which is when this entire original row of townhouses was constructed. So what Lascaux did was in the 1930s. He performed an extensive renovation on that 1860s townhouse, where he removed the front, facade and built out the house an additional three and a half feet to the front property line, and he introduced this kind of crisp, stucco and glass block facade, which is what you still see today. He also replaced the common brick facade on the rear, with a more modern, glazed brick and he enhanced it with a curving protrusion at the second floor, which was the master bedroom and lastly, he took over most of the rear yard. By extending the ground floor or basement level almost to the very rear lot line within 10 feet of that rear, lot line to create a large studio space at the basement and to create this kind of two level outdoor terrace. On top of that basement level, I'll take you through a few more drawings that help understand the project. So this cutaway section also from that 1930s Architectural Forum article, shows the organization of the house we'll highlight a few different parts. As we move through it in orange, you can see the ground floor studio which is built full. It's behind a glass block facade which is recessed slightly from the street, to create a small area way that you step down into and then enter the studio. There's reception and storage spaces at the front, a large open studio at the rear, which is lit by glass block skylights that are inset into the rear terraces. And then this kind of interesting split level configuration at the very back where going up a few steps, brings you to a library and meeting room going down. A few steps takes you into Las Casa's office, which was an extension of the studio and which opened to the shallow rear yard that remained after he built out this extension here in blue. You see the upper portion of the house. This was the residence and this kind of constitutes much of the original bulk of the original townhouse. So again, there was a modern stoop that was constructed, which created this very recessed very deeply. Recessed entry brought you into a dining room and a kitchen on the first floor, the second floor had a master bedroom at the rear, which was in that curved kind of piano section and a guest room at the front. The guest room is where you see the operable windows that are set back into the glass block facade and then the top four was one continuous, open living room which was lit by windows at the front and the rear, as well as the skyline on the roof. So again, these are the different parts with the original plans. You'll also note here in brown, the various outdoor spaces, so these two terraces, the shallow rear yard, the small area way and then the roof which, in the original design and its current configuration, was never meant to be kind of an accessible or an amenity, outdoor space, it's populated by the skylight, a mechanical bulkhead, which was added after the fact and then various mechanical equipment on dunage and it's currently only accessed by a small roof hatch and ladder. So moving ahead, you'll see the existing block elevation here. You'll note our building here to the lower left, it's one property over from the large office tower at the corner, and you can see that the row of townhouses at the center of the block, which includes the Turtle Bay Gardens historic district at the East end, has a fair bit of variety to it. There's a inconsistent kind of cornice line, the house, the height of the house, is approximately the same, but it varies from property to property and there are a variety of rooftop additions that have already been added to a number of these townhomes. This shows the same view, though it introduces our proposed rooftop edition here. There'll be larger drawings that show this in more detail coming and it shows again the scale of the house with the rooftop edition relative to the other properties on the block and now a little bit of a more detailed view of that. You can see that there's four somewhat prominently: visible, rooftop editions on the block at 221,225, 233 and 241 east 48th street, and the photo here is taken from our roof looking east and it shows the scale and prominence of these rooftop editions as they're visible from our own roof. So moving into the specific work that's proposed, the fun facade is largely restorative work and, as I mentioned, we're working directly with landmark staff on that there's kind of cleaning and refurbishment and potential replacement of some of the glass block. Where there's been water damage and cracking of the block. There is a scraping and repainting proposed for all of the metal elements at the front facade, so the front doors, the railing, the gate, there's some damage to the stucco, it's in fairly good condition, but it's got kind of dirt and staining from gears of wear and tear there's some areas of significant cracking other areas that are in pretty good shape, so we're going to investigate restoring that stucco and then repainting it to match the current historic color and then beyond that, there's the existing kind of accretions of the roof. So there's the original skylight, which is just visible here and the non-original mechanical bulkhead that was added both of these are proposed to be removed as part of the renovation at the rear of the building is where some of the more significant work takes place. So there'll be additional slides that describe this, but essentially what we're proposing is to extend the rear facade of the building further north by six feet. This is accomplished by carefully dismantling and deconstructing the existing glazed brick facade salvaging that brick and then reconstructing it six feet further to the north, to match the exact same layout and configuration that it has right now, the only other difference being that we would replace the existing non-original aluminum windows with new steel windows to better match the original design. There's also some additional work at the rear yard and the real Scott and the rear skylights I'll get into that in the further slides. So here you see the proposed views of the front and of the rear. So, as I mentioned, the front remains relatively unchanged to the existing house. It's just the restorative work. That's been discussed. The rooftop edition is set back 12 feet from the front facade. There's a section coming: that'll show where that lands relative to sight lines from the street. But the addition itself is a relatively simple volume. It'll be finished in the same stucco as the main house to better blend with it and it'll have a single large opening at its center again recessed back from the front facade. The only other element that changes at the roof here is that the construction of the rooftop edition will also require us to raise the neighbors chimneys by code, and so those will be raised to three feet above the roof of the new addition at the rear facade. Again, it appears largely as it is, except that it's pushed six feet forward of where it is now and it's reconstructed with the existing brick. That's salvaged new windows to match the existing layout and configuration just in steel rather than aluminum, and a similarly designed rear facade of the rooftop edition, also set back from the rear facade to minimize its sight lines when you're in the rear yard and again finished in stucco to match the front facade moving further ahead, because the property is a little bit complex with these different terraces and setbacks and yards there's. A few other facades to consider I won't go into too much detail unless there are specific questions here, but at the actual rear facade of the building, which is the rear of the basement extension. We are proposing to repoint the existing common brick facade. It's a bit of a patchwork of new and old brick, but nothing particularly special about it, we'll clean it up and re-point and restore it again. Replace the existing aluminum windows with more historically accurate steel framed windows and the other major piece of work, which will become more visible in another section, is to lower the existing rear yard. So what's partially visible here is that the rear yard as it's currently configured is this kind of split level configuration there's a small landing when you come out of the lower level of the basement and then a series of steps that bring you up to a raised planted area? None of it's particularly usable and the raised planter is beginning to fail, which you'll see in upcoming photos. So our proposal is to excavate and eliminate that planted area and to bring everything down to the lowest level of the rear yard, as it is right now and make it one large outdoor space accessible from the lower level of the basement, the existing window and door at the basement level would be reconfigured into one large opening with sliding doors. Lastly, at the kind of intermediate facade between the two terraces there's, some restorative work to the glazing here, which is to remove non-original glass block and replace it with windows to match the original configuration, restore the steps and the planters and then also do some work to the existing planters here along the sidewalk line. So these two planters, which are original to the house, will be converted to skylights in order to bring additional light and they will be operable skylights to bring air to this basement studio space, which is now going to be made into a habitable space. Again. I'll have a section that'll better describe that. So here you can see the proposed section of the building or sorry the existing section of the building and as I was mentioning the split level studio space at the back was designed as an office and is currently still fit out as an office space. The intention is to make it a part of the residence as it's currently configured. It doesn't get any legal light and air the existing rear yard and the windows facing onto it doesn't qualify as a legal yard and the existing glass block. Skylights though providing legal light are not operable, so they don't provide any legal air. So our proposal is to take the existing planters at the lower terrace and convert those to operable skylights and also introduce an additional skylight which will be operable at the upper terrace. You can see this in the proposed section, so there'll be a skylight built along the rear parapet, which will be an operable skylight for light and air, and so it'll become a guest room here and then the planters will be converted into skylights to bring light and air into what will become a den at the lower level. Here. The rest of the House organization remains largely as it is. The only other major change is the extension of the rear facade by six feet, which is noted here, but rebuilt in kind. This extension will eliminate one of the three glass block skylights at the lower terrace, so two will remain and one will be removed and then the addition of the roof. So again, you can see here that the roof is set back from the front facade such that when it's viewed from directly across 48th street. The addition is not visible, atop the building and it's set back from the rear, facade or the new position of the rear facade such that when you're standing at the rear of the upper terrace. The addition is not visible over the rear parapet either. In addition to that, we're proposing to lower and rebuild the existing roof by about a foot in order to minimize the vertical impact of the rooftop edition when it's placed onto the building, these are blow-up views of the existing and proposed work at the rear yard. So again, there are currently three glass block skylights one of them will be removed when the rear facade is pushed out. Here you can see the split level configuration of the rear yard. You come out onto this area, there's a series of steps that bring you up another series of steps and there's a small planted area up here. All of this would be removed and excavated and everything brought down to the lower level. These are the two existing planters to be converted to skylights, and this is the proposed location of the new skylight, and you can see those here in the proposed view. So again, the old position of the rear, facade versus the new position, the two remaining glass block, skylights, the new operable skylight up here- and the new lowered rear yard. So here for context, are some photos of the existing conditions. You could see the two levels of the rear yard here. The glass block skylight set in here, as well as the non-original glass block, monitor and planter. This is the glass block that will be replaced. These are the two small planters off to the side here, which will be converted to operable skylights. This area, where you see the barbecue grill in the drain, is what will be reworked into a new operable skylight at the upper terrace over here, and this series of photos along the top is the shallow rear yard and the existing common brick rear facade. This is the elevated planted area that we're proposing to excavate and lower bringing it down to this bottom level. Here you can see where the brick retaining wall of this planted area is beginning to fail and then again a blown-up view of the existing and proposed rooftop work. So this is the non-original mechanical bulkhead at the front, facade the skylight and the existing sloped roof. There's additional dunage here, which is not shown in this drawing and mechanical equipment. All that will be removed, but you'll see it in the upcoming photo, and these are the three chimneys that are currently shared with the neighbors. All three of these chimneys will be raised as part of the construction of the rooftop edition they'll be raised to three feet above the new roof level. So again, a blow up of this area. You'll see the setback at the front to create a terrace and to minimize the visibility of the addition, the same setback at the rear to minimize that visibility and create a terrace back there, and this dashed red line representing the existing roof level versus the proposed roof, which is one foot below the overall addition is nine feet above the existing roof level, and so now here's some photos of the roof. This is the tallest chimney and the existing mechanical bulkhead, which wraps around it so that bulkhead will be removed. Here you see some of the existing mechanical equipment on dunnage, all of that to be removed and the existing skylight to be removed. Finally, just to kind of wrap up the scope of the work. This is a cutaway 3d, drawing of the existing building so you're, seeing the demolition work at the roof at the deconstruction of the rear, facade the work at the rear, terrace and the work at the rear yard. And then, in the proposed view, you see the new rooftop addition here: the reconstructed in kind, facade, pushed back six feet the additional skylight here and the lowered rear yard and then finally, to move through some mock-up views. So this legend here identifies the different positions of the photos. The first photo is taken from directly across 48th street. What you could see is you do not see any of the rooftop edition. You do see the tops of the raised chimneys and this is an existing mechanical unit which will be removed as part of the proposed work. Then, as you move to a slightly oblique view from the West towards third Avenue, you begin to see the uppermost portion and western corner of the rooftop edition and then again some of the raised tops of chimneys and this existing condenser, which will be removed as you move further west towards third Avenue, the rooftop addition becomes more visible. This is by nature of the way the block is built out. The office tower on the corner is set back significantly from the street wall and there's a plaza along 48th street here. In addition to that, our building is built out proud of the rest of the row, so our sight lines and our measurements are taken from this proud position relative to the other neighbors. So here you begin to see more of the western face of the addition, as well as the southern or front face, and the raised chimneys, you can see. The existing mechanical bulkhead is already visible here and this mechanical unit, and you also begin to see visibility for some of the other rooftop editions which are further down the block. These westernmost views, which are taken from the far side of third Avenue, the northwest and southwest corners, are probably the most visible again. You see exposed western and southern faces and the raised chimneys. But once again you also begin to see southern western faces of neighboring rooftop editions further down the block. As you move in tighter the view becomes more cropped and then, as you begin to move to the east, the view is relatively limited by the cornice line of the neighboring buildings. The next series of photos show that you really just see the top of the raised chimney and a portion of the southeast corner of the rooftop edition, so this is from two more positions: further down East 48th street, moving towards second avenue and then. Finally, this is the addition, as it's constructed on the roof. This is a mock-up of the pushed out rear facade, so the green band here is meant to represent the new position of the rear parapet, and what you can see here is that it's set such that it blocks the view of the rooftop edition beyond and in the following slide. We did a quick Photoshop photo montage of projecting the existing rear facade if it was reconstructed and brought proud to this new six foot position again, you see that it blocks any view of the rooftop addition. You also see that its relationship to the rear yard is not significantly changed relative to what's existing. Obviously it is six feet closer I'll skip through these slides quickly. This is just to talk about the restorative work, so we're looking at different options for the glass block. As you can see, there's blocks throughout the facade that are in different states of failure and so they'll need to either be selectively replaced, or else somehow remediated in place there for the rear, brick, which will be carefully deconstructed. There's two types of brick at the rear: facade, there's a lighter kind of glossier, brick on the actual rear, facade and then sorry and then there's a slightly darker, more matte, brick on the side walls, so we're working with different masons and different brick fabricators to find matching bricks in the instances where we'll need to replace bricks during the deconstruction process. And then here again you see those existing planters and then finally, some of the miscellaneous work at the front facade. So the existing stucco, which I was saying, is a bit stained and has some cracking on the sides here. There's some peeling paint that the bulkhead below the glass block on the ground floor and we're proposing to scrape and repaint the original steel window frames on the front facade, as well as the other metal work on the front facade. And so these are just some references for that plans of the existing plans of the proposed you'll note that the overall organization of the house is not significantly different than what it is in the existing form, with the exception of the basement being adapted for residential use and the fact that we're gaining an additional six feet at the rear, facade and the smaller bulkhead at the roof, and that's it I. Thank you guys for your patience to kind of listen to the history of the house and understand the organization behind it. You know. One thing we do want to say is that when Lascaux took over this property, you know 70 years after it was first built, he undertook to expand and renovate it to reflect the architecture of his time and the personal needs of his own family and his business. He did this by surgically cutting and adding to the existing structure, graphing new onto old and now 90 years after that moment, the current owners are perform are proposing to restore elements of this house while at the same time respectfully updating and adapting this house to meet the current times and to meet their own needs. Thank you very much. Thank you. Alex and I. Don't think you ever have to apologize to this group about sharing history. We appreciate it. There's plenty more. We can get into so I also just want to say that an older architect than Alex I really appreciate. La Scaza's work, I think he's a little bit underrated and when we took on this project it was kind of with reverence, so everything we tried to do here was trying to channel the scars into this renovation to accommodate the new owners, but thanks for listening sure, I always thought it was interesting that he made do without windows and wasn't that because of the air conditioning that he had established there I know that had only the four windows that we see on the upper floors. Yeah that's correct. It was one of the first houses to introduce air conditioning at its time, and so that's yeah. That's why you don't see many operable windows on the front for sound at least the rear, for that has a fair number of operators. Any questions from committee members raise your hand on zoom. If you do don't see any yet wait a little while okay questions now or forever hold your piece not see. Any I will ask if there's any public questions from the public there are not so I will ask if anyone would care to present a motion. Sure I'll present a motion in support of the application. Thank you mark I'll. Secondly, Second Dean seconded okay, so I will conduct the roll call of votes and say whether you are in favor against abstain or abstain for cause. Kevin O'keefe in Favor, Gene, D'onofrio, favor, Marty, Barrett, Matt Bondi in Favor, Anton, Mallner, I, don't know if he can hear yeah I. Think Anton you're on mute, I believe doesn't look like he's on mute, I'll get back to Anton in a moment: Raj Nayar, okay, Rachel Patel in favor, Sean Sherman in Favor, Mark Thompson in favor, Ronnie, White, I, don't think Ronnie is here: Gary Pappush in Favor, Dean Stephanies in favor, Anton Mallner. Maybe Anton can just give us a thumbs up or a thumbs down. Since we can't hear him yeah or yeah I mean maybe thumbs up for, like rate, maybe raise your hand through zoom if until I just gave a thumbs up just give it a thumbs up. Okay, so he's in theater the resolution passes. Thank you very much. Thank you guys. Best of luck to you. Thank you. Okay. We will move on to our presentation. It's for a temporary public art installation by an artist who is with us today, Jim Rennert, it is proposed to come to Dag. Hammer should Plaza take it away. Can you all hear me great? I'm Elizabeth Masella, I'm just gonna introduce the artist and the gallery who is partnering on the exhibition. I'm the senior public art coordinator at NYC parks, I, believe the last time I was presenting to Cv6 was right before the pandemic foreign artwork. That was recently installed at Dag Hammershow Plaza by an artist named Noah Bornstein called peace gorilla. You might have seen it that went in right before Thanksgiving so tonight, I'm here to share some information with you for another exhibition coming to camera, show we're looking probably sometime in the next month or so. This will be on the second Avenue side of the plaza there's kind of a raised platform there. Where we've had many exhibitions in the past, the exhibition will consist of four large sculptures. Each of the sculptures is I believe over a thousand pounds, so they'll be quite heavy. They don't require any bolting to the existing hardscape, and you know at a thousand pounds, they'll be very difficult to move for our program. Just to give you a brief overview, we permit temporary public artworks in parks. Citywide we're a small set staff of two people. Temporaries can is anything that is temporary is on view for up to one year. These works will probably be there through the end of the summer, artists or their galleries, or their representatives are required to maintain exhibitions for the duration. We've had a very successful run of exhibitions at diagnose Plaza, where vandalism hasn't been an issue, but if it were to be an issue we have worked with cavalier galleries before and we trust that they'll take care of anything that might arise during the exhibition and with that I think I'll turn it over to Cavalier galleries and the artist to share a little bit more about these sculptures intended for Doug Commercial Plaza and about the artist's work alrighty. So my name is Henry I work with cavalier galleries and I have here with us our gallery, president Ron Cavalier, as well as Lindsey Ebanks, our gallery director and, of course, Jim Rennert. The artist himself and Jim I think you'd like to tell everyone about yourself. If Brendan, if you could advance the slide, please Jim hit Alt a okay I got it. This is me when I first started sculpting and casting in my driveway out in Utah I at 34 years old, on a whim, but some clay and found out I had a bit of a an ability to sculpt and I, decided that when I found out everybody couldn't do it I better. Do that and so I taught myself basically how to sculpt and then went to a very close friend of mine, who was an art professor and asked him if I should go back to school? And luckily he told me no and said: I just need to keep sculpting. So I asked how to cast, and he introduced me to a foundry, so I sculpt in clay and then cast that in bronze. There's a whole process, which is the ancient lost, wax method of doing that. I learned by going to the foundry and for some reason they allowed me to go in and work on. My own projects and I was able to learn every facet of the casting process and cast my own work for several years. Maybe six or seven years until I went back to the foundry, because I couldn't keep up with people that wanted to work, but my work originally was very decorative. It was had a lot to do with skiing and a lot of the athletic things that I like to do. The first gallery I was ever in is in Park City Utah, I'm now in I think 10 galleries from Whistler Canada to Palm Beach, of course, Park City. I'm still in that same gallery. I've been in that gallery for 30 years now, I think and then Ron Cavalier picked me up in 2005 and really changed my life, and so I'm deeply indebted to him. We as I continued to go, I came out of the business world and so a lot of the concepts that, whether it's momentum or business as usual, which is a tug-of-war piece that I did momentum being a couple of gear pieces but or these pieces that we're presenting now all has to do with making a living or working in life to make it and to be successful. So I think that these pieces have been very well received and then even doing them on the larger scale, with under the direction of Ron, really pressed me to start making large works, and these large works have been really accepted. Well, as everywhere we've displayed them, so we're very excited about having the opportunity to have them there. I've been in originally union square for a year and then I have that piece that was displayed there now on 34th Street permanently installed in front of the anthem building at 222, East 34th street I have a another one other piece on display in the city right now at 55th and 6th, and that's the listen piece where the man is trying to tell everybody to be quiet in New York. As it was said in the paper which made me laugh because I wasn't trying to do that at all. I was just trying to express the concept of how important it is to listen and then communicate together. What are you showing them? I? Don't know how to do that. Oh no, I'm, Brendan or I can actually show on my screen. If you scream, you want to share something on your screen, Henry how to share the presentation from my computer. Oh yeah, I've stopped to share on my screen and you can show on your screen. Instead, if you'd like there, we go perfect. So that's listen on 55th and six right now. It's 13 feet tall about, and it makes quite an impression when people walk up really fun. I can't quite see the one on the right. Is that thing big in front of, let's think big anthem yeah my match before I might hand the presentation back off to you, I, don't know! What's on my internet connection right now, and then we'll tell you which slide to go, do Brendan. Sorry, that's fine! You'll need to exit out of your presentation. It always bumps me out, but there you go, I'm back anyway, I. Just I'm really grateful for the opportunity to show these and in the park there I think it's a beautiful setting, I think the work will you know just really set it off and or the actually. The presence of that park will really set it off, which I think will be really well received. So anyway, that's a little bit about me. I, don't know where you want to go from here: Henry! Well, you wanna. Maybe talk about the works a bit so go to. If you go to the third slide Brendan we have two of the works there commute and teamwork too, you could maybe want to tell us a bit about them. Commute is a piece that I originally did. That was six inches wide, and this piece is a little bit larger than life on a bench and it basically is you got a guy there waiting for the train. That may never come because he's in a park instead of by the railroad station and then the one on the right is teamwork, two, which was the second concept about teamwork, that I put together, but this one has a female figure: pulling up a male figure, so I tried to incorporate a little bit more, including female figures in my work over the last couple of years, and this is one of the pieces that I think will look really nice it's about. It's also about 13 feet tall. If I remember correctly, it's a whole new addition, too I believe we almost sold out all sizes, the original teamwork by now yeah, and then the we have the other two works, which I believe are two of your show-stopping monumental pieces. Well, the one on the left is timing. That concept everything that I do has a concept behind it and to me timing is everything whether you're in the right place at the right time, you're trying to be somewhere on time. I mean has everything to do with how you how successful you are in trying to pursue your dream? One on the right is inner dialogue, that's in front of the Boca Raton, I'm trying to think of the Boca, Raton, Hotel and club, or something like that. But that was on display there and that's a lot more about. Like I said it's inner dialogue, it's a man, communicating with himself always trying to reflect on whether it's his conscience or his choices or whatever he's doing, and how he's trying to do. Those and I thought that was a very relative concept and that's what came out of that and next along we on the along I, believe we show the placement of each themselves right by that consulate to Jordan and Saudi Arabia. So just all in a nice little line commute a little bit closer to 2nd Avenue. Just so hey it's a nice inviting place for people to sit because the bench is quite functional. It was quite popular with many people in Nantucket this past summer. Also that way, it's not really overshadowed by the other groups, though it is, it does speak for itself and then the we do have illustrations of think big, which you mentioned. We did from 2014 to 2015 and it was very popular that was with the parks department as well. There's you, of course, back then I was a younger man. A little chubbier too one on the left is his perspective. It was the second large piece: I did that's a six foot six version of it. I did an eight foot version of that for a law firm in Oklahoma City, one of the interesting things about Oklahoma, City and I. Didn't know this until we were involved in this project, but every piece, no matter if it's on your front yard and you own the property. If you own the building, it does not matter, it has to pass through the committee of the art arts and in Oklahoma City, or you can not put it out. They will pick it up and take it away and that I, when we did the groundbreaking or the placement of the installation of the sculpture, I mean I, was able to speak and thank those people for giving me the opportunity to actually have that place in their city. I can't see the one to the right, though it's blocked. Oh, that's the function of zoom right now. No, it's still think big, but just from another angle, okay, that was on that was when it was outside the gal around 57th street and then next one. We already did view briefly. The along was listen, which is out now and also think big outside the anthem. I, don't call if it's the same one that was basically purchased or if it was one of those cats. The one thing big is the same one that was on in it's the cast bronze that was in the union, Square right, it's permanent home, now, yeah and all right. So now we can move on to a little bit outside New York. On the we have your recent multi-work monumental solo exhibition at the End Norton Sculpture Gallery in sculpture, garden rather in Palm Beach, so yeah that was a great show. I had 14 large works there and really had a great reception. They had more traffic through their with my work. They hadn't mentioned this to me, I'm saying this not boastfully but gratefully that it was really well received and they had like three times the patrons or the public come through their sculpture garden. With this exhibition than any other exhibition, which I thought was really great, we did have a. We did have with Covid-19 shut it down halfway through, but it was still a great experience and, like I, say I'm looking forward to placing these in the park here so and hopefully the mayor comes to that too I mean you met the mayor in that upper right photo. We have right there and this show is kind of the natural outgrowth of that show as well. It's a desire to bring some of it to New, York, City and next along in the we have. This was a special commission done out in California's, steadfastness or patriotic piece, which you can maybe tell us a bit more about at the Pacific palisades yeah. This was a guy in and the developer out in California. He was on his I, think 20th project and he's done malls and little shopping centers, and this happens to be right there in Pacific Palisades and they reconstructed the movie theater back to what it used to be they've done away with it. So they rebuilt the movie theater with the same sign from the same architectural drawings. It's a very high-end exclusive place, but it's very. It fits the community there. So the stores like where maybe I don't know, Sabor or whatever would have a 10,000 square feet minimum there. They had five and he forced everybody to downsize and make it very comfortable. They have areas where you can have picnics and everything else, but when I was talking to him, he said he'd like something patriotic and because right across from him is the american flag, their flagpole of the property, and so he said. Can we have a guy saluting and I said well, I said that what if he has his hand over his heart, like pledge of allegiance to where that isn't necessarily military, but encompasses everyone? And he really liked that idea, and so that's the that's how it ended up with steadfast tall by the way yeah, hopefully one day, I'm monumental, he won't. Let me do he wouldn't let me do 13. He thought it was too big now on the which is pretty much the last one before our thank you. We have the perspective that went out to Oklahoma City as well and then really, which was in Winnetka before going out I believe to Naples or Palm Beach. You went back to Naples yeah we've done well in Naples, there's a there's another developer down there. That really enjoys my work and I. Think I have probably eight pieces on that. Fifth I think it's fifth Avenue that main street that they have there and I believe that's one of them that he installed the one on the right which is really but anyway, you can see. This is another eight footer in perspective on the left there for Kepler, Law, well yeah and you just keep putting new and more pieces all across the country. So, thank you. Jim there's some great examples of the work and well now we can move on to the next languages. Thank you, but then also that was up to any questions from the community board or the public I'll hand it off. Thank you, Elizabeth. Is there anything else that you wanted to talk about as far as placement safety, at the plaza anything else before we do open it up for questions generally, we've been exhibiting at least one, if not two or more exhibitions per year, at Dag, Hammer, Show, Plaza and they've all been very successful. We haven't really had any issues with you know: safety, vandalism. Anything like that and they've been quite varied over time. The exhibitions that we have had there we've also worked with Cavalier galleries before we've had successful exhibitions with them in other parks around the city, so I don't know if I have too much else to add I just should have had it at the beginning of the presentation that this is. We come to you just for informational purposes, because what we're doing is temporary, we don't require a resolution, but I believe the Parks Committee in the past has often offered a letter of support for us for our exhibitions. Thank you. We were aware of that and we thank you all wonderful presentation, Jim, it's great seeing some of your other pieces of work. Thank you guys. Any comments or questions from the committee raise your hand on zoom. If you do again, this is for informational purposes, so we will, if there's any questions from the public. This would be your time to indicate there are not so we do thank everyone for that presentation and that background and that information great, thank you. Wesley Hamilton is here from the from NYC parks with I believe a report. Hopefully you can hear me and that's going to be a tough presentation to just follow up on. That's really impossible. That's some always great artwork and I really look forward to seeing that in our park there. So thank you Jim for your work and always Elizabeth for you bringing this wonderful art to our park. So again, I can't really follow it up. I'll try to be brief, but thank you for that and thank you for everyone coming out. I hope everyone had a very good thanksgiving, I'm Wesley Hamilton, I'm the district park manager. I just have a few updates. Not really a lot has changed, but recently our maintenance crews did perform their snow dry run. I, don't even like to talk about snow, yet it's a little early but I guess it is getting close to Christmas. So it could happen at any time, but we checked all our equipment. We made a dry run to check to make sure there wasn't any obstacles or anything in our way and make sure all our equipment's running, so that was successful, so we're prepared for the snow and the winter comes as best as we can, depending on how much we get, but we're ready for that. Our permits in the parks are pretty much the same as it was last month. We are still allowing small gatherings. Events such as birthday parties, nothing that would draw in events, no music, no large entertainment, anything that wouldn't be authorized, but birthday parties are currently being authorized for permits. We also are still continuing to allow our youth sports and, of course, first amendment permits and anything of a religious nature permits are still approved, so that camera should all we're seeing events going on there. So, if you see those are still permitted, we've definitely noticed in our maintenance crews that we've had an uptick in graffiti and litter and some rodents and we're addressing those issues. The Bros hired a new exterminator, so we're increasing our amounts of applications and treating our sites. So if anybody has issues like that, if they see issues, please let us know we'll try to address them as quickly as possible, but we're moving forward in that area and we'll see coming up. We've also permitted we're going to be having our holiday trees or Christmas trees and menorah likes that many people are permitted for so you'll be seeing those being installed and going up in a few locations throughout the district parks, and that's pretty much. It I mean most oh I forgot. The big thing which is ass or levy park is has begun. The Esker East Coast resiliency project for those who aren't familiar. It's a EDC project concerning with the flooding of the area, so they're going to start at acid levy. They've already started fencing it off and starting demolishing certain parts of it, and if there's any issues with that, please let us know if the community has any questions, but that's moving forward and they're, making a great progress. I think we'll see them probably finish ahead of schedule, so they're moving forward on that most of our other capital projects, if any of them are going out to bid most of them are awaiting bid and currently under Covid-19 OMB has been holding up on releasing the information to go out to bid, but so that's where we're at on a lot of our projects that haven't that have completed the design phase, but have not gone off to bid they're kind of on pause, momentarily financially waiting for, hopefully, to make sure that everything is good. We will see after the Covid-19, hopefully but other than that. We have a few things that are still in design and pretty much where we were the saint Vardens I believe is still in the design phase that we had our meeting with we're moving forward with that as well. But that's all the updates that I have, if anybody has any questions for me, is I'd, be happy to try to answer them or look into them and get back to the board. If I don't have the answer thanks, Wes I do want to see I received, as Brendan did less than a week ago a note from Pedro and Council member Rivera's office. Pedro wrote this is about Albano Jr. Playground playground, which of course, is still under the auspices of the MTA. Pedro wrote rather good news. Today. The project is once again moving through the MTA channels and should be resolved still looking at three to four months for agreement to finalize pending an MTA board vote, but at least they will recommence the discussions internally and with parks they should be reaching out to Dpr soon and if they do not I'll be checking again with the governor's team. That sounds like great news, actually anything to add to that. That's exciting! That's very good news. Thank you sure. So. The other question that we, of course, is always going to come back is the garden at St Vartan, whether that has been further looked into to make available for more public use. I know: Steve Simon had mentioned that last time he was with us any updates or questions about that. Not at this time I mean I. Do know that Steve is our chief of staff. It was looking into it and he's considering all options, but I, don't believe they've made a decision on the garden area as of yet but I will follow up with Steve and if he has any new information, I'll happily update the board, I appreciate it. We do have some questions: Matt, Bondi, you're up. Thank you, Kevin, hey Wesley. How are you doing good man? How are you doing hiding? We were just wondering about the chain-link fences at the Sutton Place parks. If you could just update us eventually on that would be great they're still up there. I know it probably has a lot to do with the construction work in the backyard of one second place, which is incomplete and was delayed for you know because of the covered pause and everything else. So you can just let us know about those channeling fences. They've been up there for quite some time and I seem to recall it being a function of them needing to install a fence, but on the one hand, there's a fence there already on 56th street there is no fence on 57th street and I'm just wondering what's going on, so let me get a chance. If you could. Let me know that would be great, we'll do it. I know you brought that up last month and I apologize, but we're still looking into that and that's again, that's through the Sutton one property there. So it's a it's not my usual chain of information, but I'll. Try I'm trying to get a hold of them and try to get some kind of response for them. On that we'll I'll do that. Thank you. Martin Barrett has a question. Staying with Sutton Park the last couple of weeks. There were musicians, one was just a couple with a guitar is: are these musicians sanctioned or are they it's just pick up and they can do as they please? No I didn't catch the location, but we haven't approved. This was set now in Sutton Park right at the 57th street side. 57 it was, it wasn't a permitted action through park, so sound is amplified, sound can be enforced by NYPD and that's who approves any amplified. Sound even parks doesn't approve the amplified sound if it is in a park, and somebody does permit requests for sound before Pd will approve it that we have to co-approve it, but ultimately, sound is determined by Pd and they can address that. So, if you do have somebody out in the remarks that are amplified sound, you can't call the policing increasing and they can also address that as well as our pep enforcement, but probably quicker action would be through the police, acoustic, guitar or any kind of acoustic instruments are generally permitted as long as they're not causing disturbance to others. That would be a different thing, but if somebody is just playing guitar and they're, not really disturbing of anybody else or playing any kind of acoustical instrument, so the real key is the amplified music. But we haven't approved any permits of that nature at Sutton and at the Sutton Parks it was a great jazz court quartet. You know no, nobody was having a problem with them, as they were really doing really good music, but again I. It wasn't approved then well again, like I said no, it wasn't a permit from us, I mean if it's you said a quartet, but I mean if it's amplified, then that's supposed to have a permit. If it was a barbershop court, we're trying to say a quartet, then that you know that's just vocally singing people can't actually do that they can. Just you know. People can just come up in the parks and sing this. It's no different than somebody singing to their. You know in their headphones walking down the street, but once they bring in amplified sound through a speaker or using any kind of electrical device right or even like a radio, then that would require a permit to be approved. Of so and parks has not approved of any of those events in that area. Thank you. Any more questions, public or committee I do not see any Jim Renner concluded this evening. The timing is everything, so we will quickly. Move on to chairs report. A4 mentioned was a welcome addition to the committee with plans for environment to be added to the CB6 responsibilities. For this committee. I believe that the new chair of Community Board, six Kyle, is on the call and I would love for him to take the floor if he could share any more about the added attention to environment. Sure thanks Kevin and first of all, congratulations on your first meeting as chair I thought it went very well. You had a lot to cover, so just want to congratulate you on a well-run meeting for the rest of the committee. At the executive committee meeting back in November, we had discussed obviously the transition that everything is going through, but particularly with frontward-facing with the overall community, but also within the community board itself, to make sure that we were tightening things up, make sure making sure that we were focused on the right issues and we determined that we wanted to do a little bit of free organization in terms of names of committees, to make sure that we were very focused on the topics that we wanted to be focusing on. So one of those changes is that parks will now be known as environment and parks to ensure that there is a substantial focus on environmental issues as well. I've talked to the chair and vice chair about this as well about several different topics that could go under this. Of course, you know. Sanitation is a huge thing. That's going on, but with everything else in terms of traffic and pollution and obviously environmental protection and conservation is a huge issue. So we wanted to make sure that we were covering that within the scope of our work. That does not mean that landmarks and cultural affairs is no longer under the portfolio of your committee. It still very much is, and that will be included in the committee descriptions for this particular committee. So rest assured that will still be within your jurisdiction, but we wanted to make sure that we had tight names, that the names were reflective of the work and that it was to sing to end to the point and also again, very frontward-facing, so that if someone who was involved with the community had a particular issue on environmental protection issues, they would know which committee to go to as we've seen through meetings and also just being the former chair of business affairs and street activities, which was another committee with a ambiguous name. You know I was getting questions about environmental issues and it wasn't really a fit under that committee. So I hope this very simple reorganization, you know motivates each and every one of the committee, members and I know it already has with the chair and the vice chair to expand your portfolio and scope into including environmental issues as well, which is already very much in the work you do on parks, but also gives you the space and support to do other things as well. Thank you, Kyle. That's awesome and I certainly, hopefully speak for everybody that we look forward to that refocus. I have one thing to add. Last week, I was leafing through a book about the history of this city that shared a conversation from the mid-1800s. Now the chat was in our district between the landowner and Francis Hawkes, a noted writer and a historian and one-time pastor at the Calvary church. Now the landowner told hawks quote here: it is buildings, towers, palaces, many Mulder and crumble beneath the touch of time, but space free, glorious, open space will remain the blessed property of the city forever unquote. Now, in these times, we should consider exploring many spaces in this district to see if they should be accessible to district residents and other members of the public. This is especially true, of course, because of the East side, coastal resiliency project that Wesley mentioned that will close a lot of the public space during the construction. As Wesley mentioned, Mostar Vassar Levy Playground has already closed and will be for months. I have started research on a number of places and will be calling on each of the committee members to start with our January meeting to join me in this research. I'll give you a couple examples of the research I have heard from one CB6 member about the scaffolding that has long been blocking the open space at the Corinthian on First Avenue. Now the photo behind me, I, snapped on Saturday, was also from first Avenue. This is one block south of the Corinthian. It has been closed to the public for many years. The inaccessible St Martin Garden that I mentioned earlier is one block south of the green space that you see behind me by the way the landowner who spoke in the mid-1800s, the need for more open space for the city was one Samuel, B Ruggles. He was talking about a park he donated that is in its third century of being closed to the public Gramercy Park more to come. Starting with our next meeting, including some invites to guardians of these inaccessible open spaces sounds like an oxymoron inaccessible, open space, any old or new business. Just one thing quickly did we determine who is writing the resolutions on the certificates of appropriateness? Thank you. Brendan I should have asked that before, but want to get that straight before the meeting is over at least I am seeking volunteers. At this point, I will always be willing to jump in and to write or help write any resolutions or minutes, but I am looking for volunteers for the two resolutions that we passed today, any volunteers going once if you want to send me the stuff on the Scott's house, I can do that. One awesome. Thank you mark. As long as Brendan sends me all the poop I'll be happy too. Okay. Sure yeah, thanks I can work on the other one. Oh, who was that was rishma I, hey ray schmo, that's great and again, I'm willing to help you with that is anyway, but thank you that'd be awesome. Yeah I mean, since we have the YouTube it's pretty easy. When you have questions to just go back so right, you got it yeah. So again, if any members of the committee have any old or new business, please raise your hand at this time. If there are no objections, then we will adjourn the meeting seeing no further business or any objections to the adjournment. This meeting is adjourned at 8:39 pm. Thank you all. Thank you.
