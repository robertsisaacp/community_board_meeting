Whenever you'd like great welcome to the December 1st meeting of the CB6 parks, landmarks and Cultural Affairs Committee.
First up is certificate of appropriateness for 238, East, 15th street, to restore the front facade as well as to have a new rooftop addition to an existing townhouse.
One thing we are going to propose is to raise the window height just on the top floor by about 12 inches, so that that's one subtle change that we're proposing on the street facade the roof.
This- is probably the best diagram for that, So we're going to propose its excavation partially of the backyard to meet with the lower level of the building.
The addition is, viewable is visible in some vantage points, so just go through each photo one by one, so this is a little bit into the park.
Here's, a zoomed version of that the rear facade of the roof edition is set back three feet from the face of the rear wall, and this is the just existing conditions of the entry area which will remain in place.
So we're going to excavate, maybe half level down on the backyard where this hatch, roughly, where this hatch portion, is, I, mean, I, think from our end.
And I see you've done a lot of studies on views from the streets and whether or not it can be seen from the park and all that do you also do studies from the buildings nearby from the residents who live in the building next door.
There are too many trees in the park, which is great, but you know I, think you're, rendering a show that it's kind of hard to see.
But, as some of you likely know, This is a kind of unique property and there's a broad scope of work.
The, proposed scope of work is for a rooftop addition, a rear, facade extension and the lowering of the rear, yard.
He performed an extensive renovation on that 1860s townhouse, where he removed the front, facade and built out the house an additional three and a half feet to the front property line, and he introduced this kind of crisp, stucco and glass block facade, which is what you still see.
It's behind a glass block facade which is recessed slightly from the street, to create a small area way that you step down into and then enter the studio.
The guest room is where you see the operable windows that are set back into the glass block facade and then the top four was one continuous, open living room which was lit by windows at the front and the rear, as well as the skyline on the roof.
Also note here in brown, the various outdoor spaces, So these two terraces, the shallow rear, yard, the small area way and then the roof which, in the original design and its current configuration, was never meant to be kind of an accessible or an amenity, outdoor space, it's populated by the skylight, a mechanical bulkhead, which was added after the fact and then various mechanical equipment on dunage.
Note our building here to the lower left, It's one property over from the large office tower at the corner, and you can see that the row of townhouses at the center of the block, which includes the Turtle Bay Gardens historic district at the East end, has a fair bit of variety to it.
It shows again the scale of the house with the rooftop edition relative to the other properties on the block and now a little bit of a more detailed view of that.
You can see that there's four somewhat prominently: visible, rooftop editions on the block at 221,225, 233 and 241 east 48th, street, and.
Moving into the specific work, that's proposed, the fun facade is largely restorative work, and, as I mentioned, we're working directly with landmark staff on that there's kind of cleaning and refurbishment and potential replacement of some of the glass block.
There's the original skylight, which is just visible here, and the non-original mechanical bulkhead that was added both of these are proposed to be removed as part of the renovation at the rear of the building is where some of the more significant work takes.
So there'll be additional slides that describe this, but essentially, what we're proposing is to extend the rear facade of the building further north by six feet.
This is accomplished by carefully dismantling and deconstructing the existing glazed brick facade salvaging that brick and then reconstructing it six feet further to the north, to match the exact same layout and configuration that it has right, now, the only other difference being that we would replace the existing non-original aluminum windows with new steel windows to better match the original design.
The only other element that changes at the roof here is that the construction of the rooftop edition will also require us to raise the neighbors chimneys by code, and so those will be raised to three feet above the roof of the new addition at the rear, facade.
That's, salvaged new windows to match the existing layout and configuration just in steel rather than aluminum, and a similarly designed rear facade of the rooftop edition, also set back from the rear facade to minimize its sight lines when you're in the rear yard and again finished in stucco to match the front facade moving further ahead, because the property is a little bit complex with these different terraces and setbacks and yards.
Replace the existing aluminum windows with more historically accurate steel framed windows and the other major piece of work, which will become more visible in another section, is to lower the existing rear.
So, what's partially visible here, is that the rear yard as it's currently configured is this kind of split level.
Our proposal is to excavate and eliminate that planted area and to bring everything down to the lowest level of the rear yard, as it is right now and make it one large outdoor space accessible from the lower level of the basement, the existing window and door at the basement level would be reconfigured into one large opening with sliding doors.
Lastly, at the kind of intermediate facade between the two terraces there's, Some restorative work to the glazing here, which is to remove non-original glass block and replace it with windows to match the original configuration, restore the steps and the planters and then also do some work to the existing planters here along the sidewalk line.
This extension will eliminate one of the three glass block skylights at the lower terrace, so two will remain and one will be removed and then the addition of the roof.
In addition to that, we're proposing to lower and rebuild the existing roof by about a foot in order to minimize the vertical impact of the rooftop edition when it's placed onto the building, these are blow-up views of the existing and proposed work at the rear, yard.
So again, the old position of the rear, facade versus the new position, the two remaining glass block, skylights, the new operable skylight up here- and the new lowered rear yard.
This area, where you see the barbecue grill in the drain, is what will be reworked into a new operable skylight at the upper terrace over here, and this series of photos along the top is the shallow rear yard and the existing common brick rear.
And, then again, a blown-up view of the existing and proposed rooftop work.
This is a cutaway 3d, drawing of the existing building so you're, seeing the demolition work at the roof at the deconstruction of the rear, facade the work at the rear, terrace and the work at the rear, yard.
The reconstructed in kind, facade, pushed back six feet, the additional skylight here and the lowered rear yard.
This is a mock-up of the pushed out rear facade, So the green band here is meant to represent the new position of the rear parapet, and what you can see here is that it's set such that it blocks the view of the rooftop edition beyond and in the following slide.
We did a quick Photoshop photo montage of projecting the existing rear facade if it was reconstructed and brought proud to this new six foot position.
This is just to talk about the restorative work, so we're looking at different options for the glass block.
One thing we do want to say is that when Lascaux took over this property, you know 70 years after it was first built, he undertook to expand and renovate it to reflect the architecture of his time and the personal needs of his own family and his business.
It was kind of with reverence, so everything we tried to do here was trying to channel the scars into this renovation to accommodate the new owners, But thanks for listening, sure, I always thought it was interesting that he made do without windows and wasn't that because of the air conditioning that he had established, there.
The senior public art coordinator at NYC, parks, I, believe the last time I was presenting to Cv6 was right before the pandemic.
I. Think I'll turn it over to Cavalier galleries and the artist to share a little bit more about these sculptures intended for Doug Commercial Plaza and about the artist's work.
I tried to incorporate a little bit more, including female figures in my work over the last couple of years, and this is one of the pieces that I think will look really nice.
We've also worked with Cavalier galleries before we've had successful exhibitions with them in other parks around the city.
We come to you just for informational purposes, because what we're doing is temporary, we don't require a resolution, but I believe the Parks Committee in the past has often offered a letter of support for us for our exhibitions.
We thank you all wonderful, presentation, Jim, It's great seeing some of your other pieces of work.
Thank you, Jim for your work and always Elizabeth for you bringing this wonderful art to our park.
Our holiday trees or Christmas trees and menorah likes that many people are permitted for so you'll be seeing those being installed and going up in a few locations throughout the district parks, and that's pretty much.
Other question that we, of course, is always going to come back is the garden at St Vartan, whether that has been further looked into to make available for more public use.
You, know in their headphones walking down the street, but once they bring in amplified sound through a speaker or using any kind of electrical device right or even like a radio, then that would require a permit to be approved.
And I know it already has with the chair and the vice chair to expand your portfolio and scope into including environmental issues as well, which is already very much in the work you do on parks, but also gives you the space and support to do other things as well.
So again, If any members of the committee have any old or new business, please raise your hand at this time
