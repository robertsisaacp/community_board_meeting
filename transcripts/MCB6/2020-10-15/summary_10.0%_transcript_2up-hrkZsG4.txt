We're live here at Manhattan, Community, Board, Six's, October, 14th, And I'm molly hollister CB6, chair and We're joined by several public members as well and elected officials.
Well as many as we can obligations and everything we're trying to be careful, considering the pandemic, as you know, we're trying our best here to pass responsible legislation to continue the hearings to hold our agencies, accountable, making sure that we're providing constituent services and just addressing all of the concerns- I want to thank CB6 for bringing people together and having a really great discussion on housing, specifically around people experiencing as neighbors and as a city to kind of improve people's lives and the conditions of our neighborhoods.
I'd like us to be a little bit higher in the kind of ranking of the City Council, and I know that Katie's also going to go over a little bit on testing and tracing Thank you, sure, hollister, to tell you that it has been an absolute pleasure getting to know you over these years having you in leadership, having really honest conversations around issues related to racism and policing and housing and homelessness and having you lead this community board in a way that with dignity and with respect for all people.
Thank, you, molly Katie's, going to give the report, I think you're a great person and a fabulous chair, and I wanted to just be here to tell you in a pandemic, you can bump into molly on the street and it's an absolute good thing.
The first time and then extended It means that small businesses in our neighborhood do not need to have to worry about losing their entire life savings when it comes to being closed right now, and that was a really important one.
Here is going to mean we can figure out how to make it work best for our community and other areas, and also making sure these businesses will stay in business at a really important time.
Something we'd really ask you guys to take a look at as one way one tool to be able to help small businesses at a time where we really need it and one of the ways we're trying to be most creative to view this problem being in the most holistic way, so that all people in the sort of pipeline here when it comes to our city and the properties and the small businesses are all being part of that same conversation.
But, not far away where the mayor proposed to displace folks in a family, adult family shelter that had opened up right when I came into office and have been really a good partner in this community and a home for these folks as they look for permanent home.
You can't afford a department on that, so people stuck in shelter system when they should be in housing and when they're ready to be into housing, so we're really trying to expand that it's obviously a little fiscally challenging right now, but a few bills we've been working, on.
Right now, I'll be happy to just to send you more information to your staff, but I insofar as is extending the moratorium, I would exclude garage operators they're frankly making out like bandits now, because everybody that comes into the city now is parking.
I heard stories from like restaurant owners who had poured their savings into a business and wanted to make sure that they were not going to leave.
Everyone who's ever worked with you as chair, has such incredible fondness and respect for your sense of purpose, professionalism, self, deprecation and just overall, really good mindset about how important your work and the Community board's work is to making government work for the people.
After all, the foot traffic there has disappeared through no fault of these businesses and the MTA in the state of New York, I believe, needs to set at the right standard, much like police officers who wear masks the MTA being a landlord needs to set the right tone and relationship with their commercial tenants.
If you're a gay man, you can't do it because of the FDA regulations, but hopefully we can make that point with our give for a gay blood drive and then finally, I wanted to mention a new bill that I introduced called the fighting underground racing and our streets act or furious act which is going to expand our use of the city's speed cameras during off hours to hopefully catch those thrill seekers and jackasses that have been drag racing and street racing during the night, keeping us up, making our streets less safe.
That sounds like a lot, but we hope there's federal aid coming soon to New York, and we want to create the mechanism to share that aid with our impacted commercial tenants as well as small landlords.
Now, the most important of our election is just over a month away and please make that plan to vote mail early or in person just in time.
We also just had an election information session where we're lucky to hear from Attorney General James Democracy NYC vote, early, New York and the State Board of elections.
They're going to be basically cardboard, they're going to be colored, they're going to look like they did in high school or grade School, or what have you, but they will be safe, you'll, be able to drop an absentee ballot at any early voting poll site or any election site on election day.
I worked with Manhattan bro president Brewer and Council member Keith powers to ask the mayor to allow outdoor dining, rather than just having people drinking on the streets without any protections whatsoever, and so he did that.
I, just hopped on Google maps, so I can see that the big hole in the ground in the middle of the block, that block looks pretty built up so If you want to email me policy at benkaylos.com, I'll work with you, I'll support, Councilmember powers, office, and let's just the thing that will helpful to know.
We have worked for over a decade easily serving the communities of the side, and I know that you're we're going to continue to work together for a long time to come?
Somebody, remember, gottfried is really encouraging everyone to vote in person He's very concerned about all of the noise being made by some people to challenge the results if they do not turn out the way they want, and we think it's important that there's a clear popular vote mandate on election day, itself.
How to vote absentee just make sure you have all your options and on October 29th we have a manhattan- wide virtual tenant, resource, Fair, it's going to be in both english and spanish Sponsored by Council, Members, Diana, Ayala and Udonis Rodriguez, as well as HPD Hispanic federation, a couple other great organizations.
So, all so we'll borough, President Brewer is on A couple issues that we're working on one is that we all know about voting but, as others have pointed out.
There are 37,000 poll workers, some work where they can walk, but others, I think, are going to need the subway or some way to get there at 5 A.M, because the subways are closed from 1 to 5..
Second issue, is, I know this is way in the future, but I just want board.
I think that there has to be a plan for police community relations, and so he probably saw he nominated three people to do that, and my understanding is that the each borough was going to have hearings and so on, and so forth.
You are inspirational, also, and I want to thank molly and Asus, and everybody who makes this board work.
Just today, the Comptroller Controller Scott Stringer unveiled a comprehensive overhaul of Workforce development in New York City, including making CUNY community colleges free for all to build a more competitive and inclusive post- pandemic economy and to better align training with the jobs of tomorrow, with cover 19, displacing hundreds of thousands of workers and rapidly accelerating long- standing trends in E, Commerce, Telework, digitization and automation.
And I can I'm just going to end up echoing everything they said, but since I've been with the comptroller's office since 2017, even before your chair, you've always been a great go- to person for Community, Board, six, and Welcoming me welcoming me to Manhattan And I've, never worked in Manhattan before so.
And I know you're, not going anywhere, so I look forward to continue working with you , Someone confirm cody or Jesus, okay, good, all right, so we'll move the agenda to the any public.
A, Robert Fouche, who is a resident of the district, would like to speak about double parking on East 24th street before between second and first okay, There is a three minute time limit for publix public, there's a garage that you have to go into to access the garage on East 24th street for East Midtown, plaza residents, so there's been people double parking there And there were some cars that were from out of state that had out of state plate.
And, I know, there's a lot more cars in the city right now, We experience that all over the district, so we'll work on that for you, okay.
You know, send it out to other people, we're hoping to get a large crowd to kind of bring awareness to resiliency and communication and working together, community boards and residents.
The office has been working to improve community attendance and participation at our monthly meetings and to increase the number of district residents that are subscribed to our newsletter.
After, the fact, corrine and rich of our housing homeless and human Rights committee did a great job, organizing and managing the panel discussion on systemic solutions to the crisis of homelessness.
Committee did a great job fielding questions from residents at their meeting where they heard updates from city agencies on large district area, projects.
Also love to thank the board staff, as always for their hard work and Rick and to the rest of the elections Committee for putting together a very fair and organized process.
So tonight we're casting our votes, not just for the future of our city, but for our Community board.
As, chair of the committee, I pressed until acs got the funding it needed for programming and staffing, as well as created its own community advisory.
The link to the election of board officer ballot is right.
So we have a resolution that you have not yet seen And I'm going to ask if the board can, if the office can please put it up on the screen.
Excuse, me, molly, there's a second piece to the It. Is that I want to make sure that people have seen that because they were just looking at the table before this?
Think we're voting on the information that you shared and The resolution that saying we're in support of these budget.
You know they have sort of scaled back on their project that they had presented to us early in the year before Covid-19, and so we still need to press our electeds and other community groups to help raise awareness of how to improve and activate the east side and how to get funding for these.
Thank you for all of that, all those open communications, and, I, think, I, think that everyone was being quite reasonable and it knows a lot of work.
We discussed this, and this is what was you know, our intent with this, so we put forth encouragement at the Senate level or see our Us senators and also encouraged our state and city locals to work in conjunction with that, but also to have a safe fail plan in case the federal funding does not come through.
That's the first item questions you have your ballot, so I'm used to saying all those in favor, but I mean people are saying: bundle, So yes, please vote on resolution 4a and we can.
We have some time to build up and really figure out how we want to put this together, and that includes calling in you know the Broadway League, for example, to talk to us about what their specific needs are outside of funding and then with the reopening of movie theaters.
And I know that you've been working pretty hard on a lot of these resolutions.
We want to make sure that the big ask about you, know federal funding and then also putting it on the right.
We just want to make sure that we're thinking about all of these different businesses and the employees and workers that work within those industries as well.
I mean I, do not know if anyone has been to the Times Square area, The resolution we've put in a lot of that statistical information as Jim just mentioned, 15 billion from Broadway alone, hundreds of thousands of jobs related to that Venues, theaters, off, broadway, off off- broadway that are included as part of this as well that we just want to make sure people are not forgetting about it and taking action on it.
There's no major report again just want to thank the board staff for their support.
So I want to thank rich, my our the my vice chair for his work and cody, who you know helped tremendously.
We are working with the housing rights initiative to identify some buildings in communities, district, six that are out of compliance and also talking more generally about the problem.
All right, so we'll move to Kavitha, Matthews 197A working group, tour, hi, everybody, It , was, I, know that a lot of people in my building and community joined too.
We heard a lot about senior housing, supportive housing things like that, we're looking for more input, and we have ways to gather that in the website, which is really just a sub- domain of our community board.
I mean it's not in the resolution right, but for the for the new budget cycle, something like that, I think, should be included in the in presumably the capital budget.
So we have the air table posted again for a second round of voting for the position of board chair only so please vote.
I just would think we need to check with Charles to make sure his vote stands or if he wants to make any changes.
But we want to know if they're going to vote or not Both people are still here, come on raj.
One opposed one abstention, one, not entitled all of the resolutions passed all right, great work, everybody!
