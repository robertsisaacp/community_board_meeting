Welcome to the October 14 2020, meeting of the Community Board six budget and governmental affairs, Committee.
These are the priorities we discussed at the last meeting, both for capital and for expense, you'll notice that there are some additional items that have been brought to us by the district office.
It's, safe haven, I just have concerns chair that you know we have expressed a want, a desire in our in our budget priorities for more affordable housing and more additional housing for homeless.
Beyond you know a bed and three squares, whatever it's the policy's horrible We keep subsidizing it in our district, I think, we're certainly worth discussing at the housing and homeless committee.
The rationale is because there's too much of an emphasis on the homeless without any kind of solution, We do have items for supportive, housing.
And I think this is a budget issue, So you're speaking to the stabilization beds, item absolutely, which is really what we should be looking at and not the general discussion of homeless sheltering the homeless, which is a separate committee.
