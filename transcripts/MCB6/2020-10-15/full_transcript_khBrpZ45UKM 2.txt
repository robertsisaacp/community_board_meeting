The minutes are adopted. Okay, some ground rules. We've got a very short meeting tonight. Let's try to stick with the with the schedule. Stick with the timing. I promise I will, which is saying a lot and please do not use the chat for anything other than if it's a committee member and it should be brought to. If it's business, you should be raising your hand, chat might be for something supportive, but if it's committee business, you should raise your hand and we should discuss it. Members of the public may make comments in chat, but we may not be able to get to you, because we only have 30 minutes for this meeting. We'll do our best, though, to get to any questions that are raised. Okay, so the first item of the agenda is the priorities list that was distributed in advance. These are the priorities we discussed at the last meeting, both for capital and for expense, you'll notice that there are some additional items that have been brought to us by the district office. I put those where I thought they belonged. They are by no means, that's by known means a given. You can move those around they have to. They are both in they're, both an expense one has to do with trash cans, and one has to do with graffiti okay, so, but you've all had a chance to look at these. Is there any comment? Further comment on the priority order: we're not looking at the topics themselves, looking at the priority order: okay, so if everybody's content with the order given question yes, what is more stabilization beds? Ah that was brought to us by the housing and homeless committee. Stabilization beds are for people who are found on the street who are able to be brought into emergency housing, but for whom there is no bed, and the idea is to bring them in so that you do not lose track of them so that they are under some care and then other housing be found for them. The it's kind of a in district, the auto district. The committee is asking for something near the district, because there's no real identification of a location for these in the district. The idea would be something a little bit it's kind of online, of the safe harbor on 17th street. It would be that kind of person who they've been able to finally get into housing, but there may not be a bed for that person, so they will the safe harbor the safe harbor on 17th street being the former safe haven. The hotel, it's the former Maple Thorpe house- oh that one yeah, but it's called safe havens, safe Haven. Thank you. That's right! It's safe haven, okay, I'm just I just have concerns chair that you know we have expressed a want, a desire in our in our budget priorities for more affordable housing and more additional housing for homeless and there's. I have two issues with that. First of all, is the vet in the vector that we discussed at our last meeting the vector of the spending, as opposed to the specificity of the of the spending more versus a specific number of our burden, but I also have an issue generally with the notion that none of this stuff ever seems to end up north of 59th street and from fifth to the river, the only shelter that I'm aware of in that entire area, which, as we all know, is pretty much. The atm for com for political campaigns is the shelter at the the park. Avenue, the army, armory yeah, which houses only women and only women over aged 45, okay, and I think that, in terms of fair share distribution, we've had them. We've you know we, the upper West side, they've been moved down here. The people down on Wall, Street, William Street, I understand, is, are also objecting. I mean, and community district 6 is becoming the place to House homeless and we should not have to care take more than our fair share burden. That's a violation of the city charter, as you know, and we really need to. I think we need to be a little bit more. They think we need to push back more and that we, you know it's just getting ridiculous. I mean this, and this is a committee issue more than it is a budget. You know priorities issue, but in terms of in terms of what we keep doing it, it's absurd yeah the district office has looked at, has some figures for us on fair share and we are. We are currently apparently within our fair share, the district that it seems to be taking. The most problems is actually five, our neighbor to the West right, where a lot has been put there right. However, I'm not sure there's anything we can do about eight about saying we have to be an eight well, the problem. The problem is that the people in east Midtown, like Murray Hill in that area, yeah, okay, all of the homeless, that they have in that neighborhood are adjoining the homeless in the mid-20s on in district five, so that the folks in that neighborhood are being basically overburdened. I mean we keep providing homeless or homeless shelters. We do not do anything in terms of getting be able bodied off the street. We do not provide them job training. We do not provide them support in terms of social services beyond you know a bed and three squares, whatever it's the policy's horrible and we keep subsidizing it in our district yeah. Unfortunately, it's not something we can deal with tonight. No, I understand, but I think your point will be. I think, we're certainly worth discussing at the housing and homeless committee and we'll be voting against this budget tonight. The priorities right and the- and I mean you're perfectly- that's perfectly fine yeah, but may ask you. The rationale is because there's too much of an emphasis on the homeless without any kind of solution, yeah no solution, plus we're overburdened. I mean put some of this stuff up where the donors live. Okay, Rick, Bryan, Van, Newenhoven would like the floor. Ryan you have the floor. Yeah, I'm sorry! I just I lost track. I was wondering if there was a budgetary item about what we're talking about. Is there anything about the ordering of it or is there anything about what we're asking for that's in dispute or is it just? Is it just like we're talking about the item itself? The item itself, the concept itself? It's not there! It's not about it's, not one of the items on our priority list as such, because we do have. We do have items for supportive housing. We do have items for affordable housing. We do have items for special services for homeless children, so we have. We do have a number of items for homelessness. It's true. I do not, but I think that's as much as we can say right now I mean we've got there's no separate item. That says we took off an item right. So can you hear me? Yes, okay? So I support this item because I think it's important to move a budget that talks about stabilization because that's really embeds, because that's on the road to deal with homelessness and people with mental disabilities. I think the issue that is raised is really a committee issue yeah, and I think this is a budget issue, I'm fine with it, because I really feel it's part of the overall therapy that is really needed. So you're speaking to the stabilization beds item absolutely, which is really what we should be looking at and not the general discussion of homeless sheltering the homeless, which is a separate committee item. That's correct! Okay! Is there any other comments? How many are the stabilization beds? Is there? Is there a quantum for it or, ah correctly they were really talking in some number less than 10.? Okay? I can't I do not want you to hold me to that, but I'm pretty sure. That's what it was here in the in the written materials that Karen has prepared I'll, try to locate those that and get it get the information to you Jim. Thank you, okay, seeing no seeing no other comments on the items and their priorities. If someone who's, let's see, let me take a look at the. I do not see anything in chat from any of the. Are there any committee? If there's anybody from the board who's on the call who would like to make a comment they would be. I do not want to make a comment, but could you go back to the capitol you had two new items? I guess have a question about it: okay, can you what committee did the public bathroom facilities come out of housing and homeless and also the housing for the seniors, housing and homeless? Yes, the seniors housing is actually a split. It was formally included in supportive housing, but they fall under two different items on the in the canned language of the district needs. So we're separating out the the two items and the one item into two: that's the does the 197A Working committee get to submit items they could have okay, because that seems like that would have been one of their items. Okay, are you suggesting that maybe I should get in touch with them and get their input? Well, when they're, when they're discussing the Mount Sinai site they're discussing senior housing, that's good, we'll I'll get into that's. I can't remember the woman whose name is fever: okay, Lisa kavithavisa, it looks like bran, I'm sorry, it looks like B dismant would like the floor and then, after that, Brian Ben, Newenhoven, Okay b you're up. No, I think I did not put my hand down so that was from Bb4. Okay. Thank you, Brian yeah. I was just going to move to adopt both the capital and expense orderings. Okay, is there a second okay? Can we go to a vote? Please, and I will go back to Brendan to carry out a roll call vote we're going to are we going to vote on both together as a single? A single motion. Excuse me. Excuse me Rick, can you hear me? Yes, I can oh it's evil. Lasseter. There was some problem. I was muted out for attendance, but I just wanted to make sure you could hear me for the meeting now. Thank you. Okay, good make sure she's noted as being in a being present. Yep will do. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, okay. So, on the vote on the priorities for capital and expense Brian, if you could, I'm sorry not bro Brendan, could you take care of that? Please? Yes, so just a moment: okay, Rick Eggers, yes, race, mappatel! Here! Oh yes, sorry! I got confused here. Yes, Jim collins, no, on the vectors without quantums B desmond, yes, hey judge Paige been raising it for three years. Yes, okay, Karen Moore! Yes, could you tell me what Jim can you tell me what you mean by vectors for the minutes, in other words, saying more or less whatever more meaning the direction of the spending versus the actual amount of the spending? And that's I've been doing it for I've been raising the same issue at least two and I think three years. Okay, thank you and we're listening: Jim Gene santoro, yeah, Sure, Brian, Van Newenhoven here and yes, claudelinfield, yes, Eva Marie, Lasseter, yes, okay with nine in favor, one against no abstain, no none not entitled the resolution passes. Thank you we'll now move to the the rest of the resolution. In effect, what we've got is kind of a transmittal portion of the resolution. This is not all done every year, but in the in years past, meaning three or four years ago. We always had some kind of formal resolution and then attached the list to it. Has everybody had a chance to look at that resolution? Yes, that draft. Do I have any comments on that draft hearing? None. We can go to vote on the resolution. Approving Manhattan Community board, 6 budget priorities for fiscal year, 2022 the narrative portion and I will have Brendan- take the role for that. Okay, so like before. When I call your name either say in favor against abstain or not entitled Rick eckers in Favor Raymond, Patel, Jim Collins. I have to vote no because the first resolved the result. The Manhattan community board six approves the priority list, so no b dismantled in favor page judge in favor Karen Moore in Favor, Dean santoro in Favor, Brian, Van Newenhoven in Favor, Claudel Winfield in Favor, Marie Lasseter in favor, okay, with nine in favor, one opposed, no abstentions, and no nobody not entitled the resolution passed. Okay. That concludes the prepared portion of the agenda. Is there any older new business that needs to be addressed tonight, turn off your phone, whoever it is? Okay, it's you not likely. Okay, if I see no no further, do I have a motion to adjourn. Definitely, for me. Second seconded all opposed. Thank you very much. We're done and I will see you again in half an hour thanks Rick. Thank you and thank you. Thank you karen. If you have any questions, just get in touch with me and I'd be happy to help out I'll love I'll pass them by you tomorrow. Oh that's,.
