The minutes from the October 21st meeting were distributed to executive committee members ahead of time by the board.
You'll, never be able to express appreciation and, as this being the first executive key since your term ended, you know, I, want to welcome you to being a participant.
Part of this was required by people moving off and on and some chairs that needed to be replaced, and this really allowed us to have some time to re-eval, recalibrate and re-evaluate the organization of our committees and based on some of the feedback not only from the board itself, but also from people who interface with our board, whether they be the public or other community.
I had some ideas on first of all, pulling out some committees and creating new committees and then renaming some of the committees so that they more closely described the work that the committee is doing, but also with public interface, so that people know where to go and which committees to go to, and so the first two committees that I'm thinking of creating, which are basically just pulling out from two other committees, is with the transportation and public Safety.
I would like to pull out the public safety Committee from transportation and create a human rights and public Safety Committee, so that we can more closely focus on those specific issues and particularly in relation to one another human rights, public safety.
There are many voices in the city already, so you know asking the committee to focus on education.
And then kind of processing, the recommendation, or at least a suggestion, I, actually think like social services, human rights and senior services.
The hope is as well that a lot of these committees end up doing joint work as well, so human rights being a broad subject, obviously goes into housing as well goes into.
Public health goes to education as well, and really kind of creating that environment that creates more partnership amongst our committees as well and engagement.
I kind of agree with Sema about the human rights and public safety feeling a little bit off.
At the same time, a standalone public safety without some kind of, and something else can very quickly turn into a committee that is maybe a hyper focused on safety and not able to, and not looking at the broader picture.
If it's just public safety, that it will just kind of attract a certain way of thinking that I'm not comfortable with either all right.
I, don't think the human rights public safety is the most logical, combination, there's just too much going on there.
The committee meetings averaged two to three hours, because transportation has a lot to do in its own terms, and public safety wound up being pretty much an afterthought.
But having that the title and then with the budget having it be known as the budget district needs, which I think are more closely aligned with the actual focus of the committee as well.
I mean that's one of the things I was thinking about, like especially with human rights and then public safety.
You know within a lot of people's mind a police issue, so really thinking about how connecting those as well, and that's also.
Why I wanted to bring it up for discussion as well to kind of think this, through as an executive committee.
It's also going to cover cultural affairs, so your committee will still oversee that, doesn't necessarily need to be in the name, I think in the description so just really hitting on the idea of environment.
You know: correspondence about a landmark issue so still having that within the committee as well is important, but just thought to be more succinct and to the point.
We are actually going to be getting a new liaison to council member Powers Office, so you may be seeing them at your meetings.
Recently, housing had a meeting and one of the things that folks said was that hey this thing on the agenda, we didn't know about it.
You know whoever wants to attend the whole board, and especially the newer members, to kind of get an overview of that, because that's going to be really important in the ongoing work of 197a.
Give us a presentation about the bigger picture, our district in particular, how it fits in and call it something like getting around town in the 21st century, because a lot of our work over the next year or two is going to be basically rearranging street space to allow for people to move in a very different way.
It says here our agenda is still in formation which it is, and we will know more of the licenses that we have to talk about if any approaching, as the meeting comes closer so that those will be some items.
Probably, but just thinking into the time that we are in right, now, a lot of unknowns out there, but potentially maybe indoor dining, might need to be closed again and if so, there will presumably still be outdoor dining.
I think in my new business I'll bring that up to ask folks to be prepared to kind of have a discussion on outdoor dining, the status of it in our district, but other than that.
We won't make it really long, but I think observations like that and asking the committee to bring kind of more specific, intersections or places of note to discuss, and then we can see what happens from there or what might need to be done.
I. You, know I'm going to talk to my architect, friends about like how these are being thought.
Okay, moving on to the next committee, which is housing, homelessness and human rights, to see if there's no meeting for December.
Much, like the preceding committees, I, think we're going to lay over all of our agenda items which right now is nothing to January.
I just want to make sure that you know the office did a lion's share of work on the district needs and ended up having to submit it.
I just want to take a couple of minutes before we end to talk about how we use executive committee, meetings.
So I wanted to just you know, connect with all of you as the executive committee to see you know what role this plays in your work and what you would like to see going forward or what things you don't want to see going.
Don't know exactly what you're talking about you can kind of talk, often about what you're thinking about, as you know, as a chair, but you know, if you're ever having a meeting, that's discussing board business that does need to be transparent and Jesus.
Or you know, resolutions or stuff like that, should be transparent in public and Jesus.
Those kind of things, don't need to be necessarily open to the public, but open meetings law would definitely require anything having to do with forming policy, including before a resolution is actually presented to a committee that gets a little fuzzy, but some would say that even those kind of discussions have to be subject to public scrutiny, but in general we end up playing with that.
It's the same as public safety, it's the same as education, and you know it.
You know meetings that there was some way where we could meet the needs of the office for clean agendas.
Was our budget committee issue to discuss, and so we don't want to do that kind of thing.
That's on the agenda rather than discussing whether, like the agenda, has everything it needs it in whether we should just move on with the you know, the scheduling and the date and get on to the next committee.
The agenda was the all the things that come up with 197a are parts of something that a different committee does right.
I mean I, know like Abby is in health and education.
