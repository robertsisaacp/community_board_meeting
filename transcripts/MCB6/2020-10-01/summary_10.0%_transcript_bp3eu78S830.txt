We also want local officials to be updated on things that we find out and that little survey or mailchimp form allows us to track all that information, and then we can also gather some community input about what people think is needed on that.
He had a lot of questions I know, but he was able to put together at least a working website for us, and now we can Do not think we can change major elements at this point, but small things text you know, updates or if you notice, something's, not working like a link.
The, latest news, I know, was not updated and the latest news I thought we did talk about just kind of tying that in I way to the bellevue site, all right and then adding our own stuff exactly or maybe really.
, I'm, not sure ever made it into the text talking about maybe more about sustainable, green space, and you know prioritizing things like that on the site.
You know where it becomes a 197A working group meeting, and let me know what you think, that this could be more of a little bit of more outreach to the community and say we want your feedback.
I know what I'm talking about by the time we're actually interviewing and get a little more information and make sure that we are prioritizing community outreach and feedback so that it does not look like we're working kind of in this siloed way , We'd like to be able to engage more of the groups, the interest groups and the and the individuals, the residents around the area, okay.
I think you mentioned that if anything that should go, the 16th street should kind of be prioritized for green space.
So I mean what I just want to find out is: What's the best way to end up getting you know to gain waterfront access and or green space to make it more of a public.
Wonder if we you know, I'd, have to look specifically at the presentation that they gave and the maps of what's happening in that area in particular, but during the phasing of that project might present an opportunity like good timing, to address what's happening on 16th street.
So I think it's kind of like an ongoing discussion, but if I think we did this earlier, but if we wanna I do not know if we need to take a vote or just discuss you know, is there merit to further investigation on at least those two streets on I?
You know I, do not favor making the remapping the street I'd like to see the whole thing green right and by this discussion Is it worth Further discussion, not necessarily voting for remapping each of those?
On, the other issue, I, think we should continue the conversation on those two streets, because everyone needs to know what other people may think.
