You can raise any questions or comments that you have to q and a feature room if there's time following the work engage, discussion, we'll field questions from the public and we do need a volunteer to take minutes so have any volunteers.
We also want local officials to be updated on things that we find out and that little survey or mailchimp form allows us to track all that information, and then we can also gather some community input about what people think is needed on that.
The, latest news, I know, was not updated and the latest news I thought we did talk about just kind of tying that in I way to the bellevue site, all right and then adding our own stuff exactly or maybe.
, I'm, not sure ever made it into the text talking about maybe more about sustainable, green space, and you know prioritizing things like that on the site.
Think in the next, like the daily news, or somebody in the next few months, we're going to start getting the work I know what I'm talking about by the time, we're actually interviewing and get a little more information and make sure that we are prioritizing community outreach and feedback so that it doesn't look like we're working kind of in this siloed way We'd like to be able to engage more of the groups, the interest groups and the and the individuals, the residents around the area, okay.
I. Think you mentioned that if anything that should go, the 16th street should kind of be prioritized for green space.
So I mean what I just want to find out is: What's the best way to end up getting you know to gain waterfront access and or green space to make it more of a public.
Wonder if we you know, I'd, have to look specifically at the presentation that they gave and the maps of what's happening in that area in particular, but during the phasing of that project might present an opportunity like good timing, to address what's happening on 16th street.
I, guess public street or not, so I think we should definitely look into that.
You, know I, don't favor, making the remapping the street I'd like to see the whole thing green right and by this discussion Further discussion, not necessarily voting for remapping each of those?
Okay, so funding is there So I think what we should do really is connect these conversations with the land use committee on the streets and what's happening there and Whether, there's any use for our group, our working group to further investigate it.
On, the other issue, I, think we should continue the conversation on those two streets, because everyone needs to know what other people may think.
