That happens at the beginning of the committee meeting the care of the transportation committee claire. Well, we can get started now. Yeah, particularly thank you brendan for recording this meeting and welcome everyone. It's really great, to see some of your faces and hear others voices. Thank you for joining us tonight. Welcome to the september 2nd 2020 joint meeting of the cb6 transportation committee and the cb6 health and education committee. My name is claire brennan and I'm serving as the chair of the transportation committee tonight. John keller is the chair of the cb6 health and education committee and he'll be co-chairing this meeting with me. Thank you, john. This meeting is called to order at 7 003 pm tonight we are joined by district manager. Jesus perez and community associate brendan birth members of the public. You can raise any questions or comments that you have through the question and answer feature of zoom. If there is time following the committee's discussion, we will field questions from the public. Unfortunately, no one has volunteered to take minutes for tonight's meeting. So if someone from either committee is willing to volunteer to take these minutes, please raise your hand through zoom. I am not seeing any hands raised. You can get it over with the first meeting of the year. I can take it. Thank you, anju appreciate it. So andre will be taking the minutes tonight and brendan. You can make a note and claire. I will commit to doing it next month. Thank you, anne. That's helpful just to make sure, because I'm also I'm new to cb but also new to the committee. Is there a format that we use, or can I just take it from before? Yes, what happens is that the board office will send you the minutes or not the minutes, but send you the minutes template the usually the day after the meeting, okay and not verbatim, you know more general notes for folks who are interested in what happens. Maybe so now we'll take attendance and also welcome to the committee and to the board in general, and thank you for stepping up brownie points. So now we'll take attendance by roll call and jesus will conduct the roll call all right everyone. Can you hear me all right? I will call your name when I call your name, please say present. You will have to unmute yourself. Remember that claire brennan here, thank you. Gene santoro, virtually here all right. Thank you joan barenbaum present. Thank you b. Disman present. Thank you, charles fernandez present. Thank you, andrew gross president. Thank you. Molly hollister, molly hollister use of colored use of colored, okay sandy mckee present thank you, phil napolitano, phil napolitano, all right, matt roberts, matt roberts, larry, shire resin. Thank you and seligman yeah. Thank you! It's brian van newen, brian ben you win hogan present. Thank you, ronnie white ronnie, white, bob cohen, bob cohen james wilson. Thank you ray knowles ray knowles all right. We have quorum for transportation, I'll move on to health. John keller here. Thank you. Abigail cruzmark! That's right! Thank you! As your body, as your body, lb barroso present. Thank you dan divine dan divine, rich mints. Beer present all right see my shaw present. Thank you! Sean's sherman here. Thank you. Madeline sims madeline sims andrew charese here. Thank you, claude l, winfield yeah virtually thank you. Neil barclay present thank you and we have quorum for health as well. Great. Thank you jesus. So we are still doing these meetings virtually obviously in order to conduct an efficient meeting, we have a long agenda, but I just want to lay out some ground rules for us all. No one can speak until granted the floor committee members. If you have a question about committee business or wish to make a motion, please raise your hand through zoom. I think we're all familiar with this function by now, but if you click the participants icon, the participants panel should appear and you should find the raise hand function there. If you still have technical difficulty, you may click the chat, icon and relay your difficulty to the board staff and they'll help you out. The chat function should not be used for committee business or questions about agenda topics. All such remarks should be made on the record. By raising your hand, through zoom chat should only be used to alert us to any technical difficulties you are having or to state in writing information like an email address that was already stated aloud on the record during the meeting. Excuse me when a committee member is given the floor to speak, I will identify you and you can unmute yourself so that you can speak. We are required by executive order to create a verbatim transcript of this meeting. So please keep your questions and comments. Succinct and jermaine to the discussion. So brendan has the agenda up on the board right now and the minutes were also distributed ahead of time by the board office. If there's no objection, we will adopt these minutes transportation. Committee members. If you object to adopting the minutes, you may raise your hand through zoom right now, seeing no objections. The minutes from the july 6 meeting are adopted. They will soon be available on the cb6 website. So please remember the ground rules and I think sam now you can take it from here and again. We really appreciate you joining us tonight. Okay, just to quickly interrupt is the agenda adopted? Yes, oh sorry, yes, oh sorry, the agenda for tonight's meeting was distributed ahead of time by the board office and appears on the screen before you. If there's no objection, we will adopt it members of either committee. If you object to a job adopting the agenda, you can raise your hand through zoom right now, seeing no objections. The agenda is adopted and now sam, you can take it away. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you for inviting me here today, I'm here as a citizen, I am not representing any agency or any company, and this is something that I've thought about. For many years we have not built any bridges to Manhattan central business district. Since 1909 december 31st 1909 was the last bridge. The Manhattan bridge queensborough was also in 1909., so I've been thinking about this well over a decade, especially, and it's interesting that it's the health and education along with transportation, there's a healthy form of transportation, active transportation. I've been thinking about pedestrian bridges during the slowdown. My company had as slow down as many others have had. We figured rather than furloughing people, let's put people to work on some fun projects, so this is that project. So this is pedestrian, bicycle bridges and I'll run through this, in probably less than 10 minutes and happy to answer any questions and henry hamill will work on this project and he'll be assisting me. So next slide. Please and the team that I was able to enlist during this time included t y lin, which is perhaps the leading bridge design firm in the country, if not the world and the nyu school of engineering, the innovation design hub as well. So I had partners, a number of engineers have worked together on the plans you're about to see next and bicycle riding to no one's surprise has been rising well before the covet outbreak, and we've been thinking for a long time how to get more people on bikes. We have 3.8 million people pre-coded and entered central business district daily, just under 1 arrived by bite to the cbd across the east river. It's just 0.6 and there's no way to get across the hudson river directly to the cbd, so the it's zero percent. Next slide, and so we began thinking how do we get people from Queens to Manhattan cbd? How do we get maybe people from Brooklyn from new jersey, so we started out with six bridge locations and we ended up focusing on one. We didn't have the resources to study six different locations, but we studied them to some extent, but I'll focus on the one that touches in midtown Manhattan next, so the three that we focused on from new jersey from Brooklyn, touching down at governor's island from Queens connecting roosevelt island and next slide next, one just the development potential to the cornell technion campus. Next, this is just a cross section. We think 20 feet would be adequate, that's wider than the hudson and river way it could be wider. It could be. I wouldn't recommend too much any narrower than that seems to be fine with some locations, but people can stop and enjoy the views of viewing airy next, and this gives a view from Manhattan. The structure was developed by t y lynn. This is a design that is used to hang pipes and it hasn't been used necessarily for bridges or for people, but it turns out to be an incredibly cost effective way of doing it, and they also include the deck itself becomes a structural element of the bridge. If anybody's interested in the structural engineering, we could have a separate meeting about that, but that brought the park down from when I was working on this previously from over 200 million to about 100 million and depending on the ramps on the Manhattan and the queen side and connection to roosevelt island, we're looking at probably 150 million dollars next- and this is what it might look like now, just imagine from midtown Manhattan, you could take under a 10-minute walk and be roosevelt island or continue on and be in long island city. You could bike ride across in five minutes and it'd just be an extraordinary connection. We have a viewing platforms at various locations and what a view it would be from about 140 feet up in the air. This is another view from queen. What that would look like. You could see three towers. One at the Manhattan one in the Queens and one at roosevelt island next, and so how do we touch down? How do you touch down in midtown Manhattan? Well, about 20 years ago I appeared before community board six to talk about rebuilding the fdi drive and rebuilding the fdi drive. There was a lot of concern for port six and many others. What would happen if we necked down the roadway at times to just a single lane in each direction, and the community obviously did not appreciate that and asked if we could come up with another alternative and we built the outboard roadway. You could see it under construction there and those of you may recall roughly 20 years ago, if you were driving northbound on the fdr drive in the vicinity of the u.n, you would suddenly be diverted to this roadway out into the river and then you'd come back at around 61st street and that allowed the city to work on the fdr drive itself to close an entire roadway at a time so that at first they close the northbound roadway fix that roadway. You still have sick planes of traffic and then they open the northbound roadway to southbound traffic and you again had work. They worked on the southbound and you had six lanes, so this was done before it was done for cars and then it was, to my dismay, was removed. I always thought this would be a great promenade for the community and a way of building a continuous promenade around Manhattan island. It doesn't have to be this wide, but this is one possibility and I'll show you another possibility, and that is next slide. You use the 48th street ramp to the fdi drive on northbound. That ramp is a terrible, a poorly designed ramp. It comes in the left lane, which is a problem unto itself, and you have a blind merge. Then the traffic in that lane has to move over at least one lane, because there's an exit to 61st that follows it, and that creates a weave condition, numerous crashes and it reduces the capacity a great deal. So one possibility is to take that ramp out and by the way, when I say possibilities nobody's doing anything at the moment. This is a citizen just throwing out some ideas. What really has to happen is some government entity has to run with this and fully open it up to community discussion of many more alternatives that I'm showing here next slide and just to wet your appetite a little bit. Pedestrian bike bridges are being built around the world since 2000 there have been scores in the largest cities around the world. These cities are realizing. This is a great way to move people. This is in paris, which has several pedestrian bike bridges. You can see how beautiful it is. The next next is from london, the millennium bridge, taking pedestrians across the next one I wanted to just show you is a movable bridge which appears in france and bordeaux. If we can't build a big suspension bridge, as I showed you, a movable bridge may be possible as well. This allows cruise ships to go beneath it, not that we have cruise ships on the east river, but you get a little taste and I'll show you two more bridges again just to give you a little taste of what's been done since 2000. This is in amsterdam or a bridge over 2600 feet. Long and next is just the helix bridge in singapore, and I have many more, but I thought at this point I'm happy to answer any questions you may have and henry can leave up the slides if you want to go back to something. Thank you so much sam okay. So we will take questions from committee members. First and sorry, I'm just getting used to this, but I see andrew's hand is ugh. So andrew you can unmate yourself, claire thanks and doing a chair and yeah really fast feed is the feed is wrong. Jesus brendan. Can you find out what's going on? Something strange here, looks like someone's air conditioner. Thank you. Thank you james anyway. Sorry. My question, sorry to I've lost my train of thought who where's who's our speaker to sam sorry, yeah. I think this is fantastic and very cool. I just I have to just say like as a first matter of business for us to recommend a spend right to the city of like 100 to 200 million dollars. Right now, and in light of what's going on just seems to me like a hefty, a hefty ask, you know- and I love this- I think it's great for the future of the city. I mean is this something that you guys are I mean, and maybe it's to the to the board, but I mean is this something that we would recommend right now or is this something that maybe we could stipulate at a time when financially we can handle the city can handle doing something like this? I just I'm yeah, so you know good question. A project like this from concept to approval is five to seven years on average, so the money is not really needed in any large numbers until about 2027, and if you take a look at when the city did its most planning, it was during the great depression when we were in worse financial shape than we are right now, one of the keys to the success of robert moses, getting things built, whether you're a fan of moses or not or somewhere in the middle on that was he had projects ready to go once whenever the money came and I'd love to see the city and the state do that right now- and I know colleen is colleen- is on the line. D.O.T is constrained from even doing planning if money is not identified in the future. That's not d.o.t is doing planning money should be for long-term projects. This is a long-term project. So this is the type of thing that and we will see some kind of financial relief bill. We will see an infrastructure bill at some point. Whoever is ready will get the money and I think that new york should prepare itself should always be preparing itself for whenever that comes up, but right now, big money is not needed for this project right sam. I appreciate it just to rebut. I would just thank you as we, whether or not we advocate if we do, if we do perhaps to include a clause about how this would be financially for a later date, yeah sure, and if I can answer one other thing long island city is huge development going on. I don't see the city or the state having to pay for this entirely and I think the upfront work, maybe developers could pay for it. They would get an enormous benefit wherever the touchdown is in long island city. So I think for financing infrastructure and I've been involved in building a lot of infrastructure around the city. It's important to think of all the funding sources and not feel like this is a hopeless moment, and we cannot think big and, I repeat, the biggest thinking occurred during the most dire times in our history. Sam thanks, okay, thank you. Sam and andrew sandy had a question, so I just want to really reiterate what sam said that we need to plan now, and I think this is fantastic. It's a great thing for our particular neighborhood, we're already. You know the touchdown point for the cars we want to be the touchdown point for the pedestrians and the bicyclists, and I wholeheartedly support the 48th street location. I think you're probably aware that they are building currently down to 53rd as part of the as part of the east side. Greenway, so 48th would be a nice place to help extend that infrastructure down. It would actually work together with it. I absolutely think we should support this and when it comes to that point, I am going to vote for a resolution and support. Thank you. Sorry, no question just a support. Thank you thanks! Thank you sandy and next I'll call on gene his hands up too, and also this is a reminder if you're not called on, please keep yourself muted. Thank you. Gene. Take it away sure, take it away aware! No, I'm I just. I would like to second everything sandy said and point out too that what sam said about the private developers investing in larger public infrastructure is something that we at cb6 developed a model for with midtown east, which is in process now. So every builder, in that section of town, has to kick money in for public infrastructure goods, whether it's widening sidewalks, additional waiting rooms for grand schedule, whatever before they're allowed to put a shovel in the ground, and this is a kind of a model that we could apply to this going forward. So, while I understand andrew's idea about the money, we all know that that's not it's not going to be good times for new york city. We are talking about seven years into the future and planning now and thinking in those ways are how we can possibly get there and that's a thank you again, sam for coming and showing us this and thanks gene. I appreciate that and one other thing about the money is while it sounds like a lot of money, they're still in the 10-year budget of the city and the state, well over 20 billion dollars for roads and bridges. Thank you, and did you have a question I do, but I'm not sure there were people ahead of me, I'm just I don't. I don't want to see order yeah. So I also love this idea and especially if you know, as you guys have pointed out, you know if we can get developers to do it like we did. You know in east midtown, I honestly if it comes and I'd be happy to have a rezo I'd, be happy to support a reso in advance. However, and I totally agree with the idea that you know like the best time for planning is in the you know like in the darkest days, but honestly if it was if this was an item on a capital budget, and I was prioritizing it, I would be prioritizing the east side esplanade over this I'd. Much rather close the gap on the side. Greenway- and I mean sam- you even you know, raised the issue about the you know the odr and there are still a few pylons left. I think, but you know that's like I. If we have money and it's a lot harder to get the developers to pay for that, and the un certainly isn't going to so so you know, I guess, I'm happy to support it, but just not if it, if there's kind of any chance of it being at the expense literally of the greenway. The other thing I have is like it's just a little bit more of a technical question and I use like the 48th street ramp is mine, so I get that the problems with it, but I wonder about would if it would in any way reduce the cost and sort of make it work better. Where there's already they're already the development of the 53rd street the sort of fly over there is there any way that could be incorporated, probably not at this late stage. But it's just an idea. It's a thought. You know that that's all good and I absolutely and I support the greenway around Manhattan island- I've been working on that since the 1970s. So absolutely that should be given priority, but I don't see this: is it either, or I see this being a way of also helping build the queen, the greenway and all the more reason than for it to be at 48th street okay, because that would require the extra or it would strongly encourage the growth down that far all helpful. Thank you, sam yeah you're welcome. Thank you thanks ann brian hi, so, sam, I have a question for you in earlier news coverage of this proposal. One of the things I noticed was the roadway with just jog my memory. It's proposed to be 13 to 15 feet wide. Is that correct? No, it's! We have 20 feet truck. I'm sorry! Can you go back to the yeah, so we have patience? Fine, okay, I guess the question was: would it substantially have to change the engineering and the cost behind this bridge if it was something like 26 to 30 feet, something along the lines of the walkway over the hudson, and I asked that not to debate the point, but just to say that you know we've seen nothing but terrible results from a lot of this mixed traffic stuff from bikes and pedestrians on stuff. That's generally a lot narrower than this, but I just want to make sure that if we build, if we do, recommend something like this we're building for the future. But if there's a big constraint over available materials and whatnot, you maybe tell us about that. If, like if 20 feet, width is a real constraint that prevents the project cost from doubling or something like that. Let us know otherwise you know, would it be feasible to do this at like 26 or 30. yeah? I love the question and the answer is it probably would not increase the cost dramatically? In other words, a 10 increase in the width is not going to add 10 to the cost. It'll be a fraction of that, because the towers would be the same. It's really just more roadway, we're not married to any dimensions. I feel this is the minimum dimension and it's more generous than we have on the hudson river bike path, where you have mixed paths, so it would be fairly generous, but would I like to see it 24 26 sure the issue becomes? Do you then have a pinch point where you touch down say in Manhattan or in Queens, to be able to maintain that 26 foot width, so the wider you get, the greater the width of wherever you're going to touch down will be needed. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. Larry had a question. Yes, hi sam. I really like this concept and I also really like the idea that there's a possibility to tie this in to the east side. Greenway. However, where the two intersect, I think, there's a opportunity to avoid conflict among pedestrians and bicycles by arranging for the bridge to approach Manhattan at a different level than the greenway, and that there would be a way to go from one to the other via ramps, and this would maybe even be elegant and attractive, as well as enabling people to remain safe by keeping them out of conflict with each other. That sounds like a very creative design feature I hadn't thought about it, but at some point, as you're approaching the order's edge, maybe the bike lane is at a different level than the pedestrians. You separate them, and you come up with some elegant solution. When I look at what they've done in around the world and where they have connected bikeways and pedestrian ways they have used, some very beautiful designs could be a helix design. It could be some design that an olmstead would come up with, might be a tree-lined path for the pedestrians and the bikes following another path, a great opportunity here, I'm glad you brought that up. You can call it a flying junction. I like it. Okay, I have to remember larry to give you the credit larry's flying junction. Okay, thank you. Larry b had a question next, yes, thank you. I don't know if you could hear me. I want to echo a couple of things that sam said when we had the last economic stimulus. Money went for ready, shovel, ready projects, and so I think, if you look at the future, there will be some money federal money for infrastructure, and I think this fits with the whole idea of the reconcept of new york and how you make new york very modern and how you bring beauty. So I support the concept. I do agree that there's a lot of work to do and a lot of planning. This is a show proposal and, as you hear today, people will offer many other solutions, but I think I would support a resolution for the concept and think it's important for new york city and its future bring up a good point about shovel ready and I was really disappointed, not in the obama administration, but in how new york city was not ready and a lot of the shovel ready that we did spend was just repaving streets that were in pretty good condition anyhow, because we weren't ready with any innovative designs, new streets, new bridges, new plans. So all we got was a lot of asphalt, yeah. So sam I work for the federal government. I understand how projects are implemented. So that's why I'm supportive and planning terrific, not nice, but thank you claire, there's a question from a member of the public. Yes, I see that so. Mr steve, oh wants to know what the touchdown on the roosevelt island section of the bridge would be what it would look like. Okay, two possibilities, one: if the structure is elevated, it would be you know pretty difficult at that point. We'd be 135 feet up in the air, so one possibility is to use elevators by the way. That's how people got connected to roosevelt island from the queensborough bridge. I doubt it maybe larry's nodding. I don't know if too many people remember that, but you used to drive to the middle of the bridge and there was an elevator that actually took your card. These would be more modern, swift. Much as you see on second avenue subway. Another alternative, which is you know more complicated, is somehow use an outboard, a long, roosevelt island solution. A third is to use the solution that I showed you in bordeaux and build a movable bridge. The coast guard has been frowning on movable bridges, but we have 25 in new york city, and I think it's certainly possible it's not as graceful looking. It doesn't provide the skyline or the views, but that's why I like what bu is talking about as a concept? That's all we're I'm really talking about is the concept that people want to paid attention if we didn't draw something up and try to get pictures in the media on it. Thank you see no more questions. I am going to call questions now and it seems like there was some interest in writing a resolution in support of this presentation and this work claire sandy. My sorry, oh sandy has her hands up sorry about that ong sandy and sorry, I'd like to move that we vote in favor of the proposal and I I'd be happy to write the resolution, but I I'm definitely in favor if we could vote on that as our committee I'll. Second, that sounds good. So now we will take a vote. We have a debate on the potential reso. Oh, what was that sorry yeah? I just wanted to this brian. I had my hand raised in the side, but if some, if anybody else had their hand raised before me, they can go ahead up to you we're going we're voting right now, though, on right support. I just wanted to make a motion for a amendment or basically a point to be mentioned in the reso. If we vote for it, then we can discuss the reso, maybe don't we have to decide if we're for or against? First. Yes, the result, essentially the resolve clause needs to be that's. What's that's the motion and the resolve clause was stated as a resolution in support of this general plan. So as far as where, if brian is interested in perhaps proposing a whereas clause or something like that, I mean I was going to propose something as an amendment to actual resolve clause. But basically I was going to suggest something in the resolve to suggest the 26 to 30 feet, width of the of the bridge and and that's about it. I guess we could acknowledge in the, whereas this is just a suggestion that we can acknowledge that the sticker there is a sticker price on it, but that, even if we would prioritize other infrastructure in the neighborhood that we that we assume over a long time frame that planning and construction dollars become available at some point that we could plan ahead to get and we could also bring in diverse sources of funding. But for now my motion is just to change your resolve to ask for the 26 to 30 foot width of the central path, so this is b. Can I have a point of clarification sorby, I thought what we were doing we're not going to hammer out details. I would support the concept with the understanding that a lot of this has to be worked out. So I'm not too sure any resolution when we say plan or whatever we don't really have a lot of details, but you want the concept to move forward and I think that's different than saying a plan. I agree, you know we're not here to micromanage or micro engineer the bridge, we're here to push the idea that this thing can and should be built and that in now between now and 2027, there should be some serious research and time devoted to that idea. I understand that, but I think that the width of a the width of a path is a center. Can I finish: let's have one person talk, you know so to try to micromanage the exact width, height, depth, curvature and otherwise. Aspects of this particular endeavor is way in advance. What we want to do is get out there and say this is something that can be done and should be done and how it can be done is the province of new york, city's d.o.t and the other city agencies. This is what sam has just been saying. Okay, I'm done! Thank you. Okay, I did not suggest changing the height the construction, anything in the bridge other than just to suggest a central span width, because I think that that's an important property of the bridge. It massively impacts how it's used functionally, and it speaks to many issues that we've had in slightly narrower bridges and pathways in the region where the state and the city have been extremely short-sighted and given, basically, the width of a single traffic lane to a multi-use path for bikers and pedestrians, and then decided to punish the bicyclists when the very predictable conflicts happen later. I just want to add if we're having open discussion. Sorry we're voting now. If people would like to help me write the resolution, I'm all for that brian. I can certainly work with you, but we need to vote. We've actually said we are voting in support of this proposal, the details we can work out in the resolution, but we're voting yeah. Thank you sandy. So now we'll take a vote on supporting this proposal by roll call. So when your name is called for your vote, you can unmute yourself and a nay abstained or not entitled, so jesus will take the role and tally the results all right here. We go claire, brennan yay. Thank you! Gene santoro, yay. Thank you joan barrenbaum yay! Thank you b disman! Yes, thank you, charles fernandez, charles fernandez. Yes, all right! Thank you, charles andrew gross, in favor, all right. That's in favor I heard molly hollister youssef khalid sandy mckee in favor. Thank you, phil napolitano, matt roberts, larry, shire yay. Thank you and seligman. Yes, all right! So thank you, brian benue. Yes, thank you. Ronnie white, bob cohen james wilson, james wilson, okay, we'll come back to james reynolds all right. So yes, james wilson. Yes, thank you. James reynolds all right with 11. james, please mute [Laughter]! Please all right! I got him: okay, with eleven in favor zero against zero extensions, zero. None titles this motion carries okay, thank you, everyone and thank you sandy for agreeing to draft the reso and brian, I'm sure you'll, send productive notes as well. Moving on to agenda item number two actually, but before sam leaves, can I just ask a real quick question? Sorry, no! That's! Okay! I did have my hand raised though, but I'm just curious if you've spoken to the folks on the queen side and what kind of response you've gotten there so far very positive, we have talked to some developers and we've talked to some people from the community. We haven't had a community board meeting yet, but so far pretty positive. Great thanks would you be able to send a copy of this presentation to our office to aid in the drafting of the resolution? I just interject just to interject. I actually do have a copy of the presentation. I can send it to sandy who will write the resolution, wonderful as well as to andrew, who will be working on the minutes. Thank you, okay. Thank you all thanks again, sam. It was really great to have you here what a treat okay, so agenda item number two again, thank you to the health and education committee for joining us. We're going to be discussing a possible resolution regarding school play streets in our district, including a specific proposal for east 56th street between second and third avenue, I'm not sure, john. If you want to take this agenda, let us just we could do it together and certainly with sandy's help who was so involved in it. This started out as a proposal by 59 to have a play street was put forth by adele schroeder. The principal ps59 is a complex with two other schools, including the high school of art and design, who also support the proposal and matt bondi who a well-known member of the community board was very active in driving this. He wrote the resolution and made this happen with sandy and claire's support we reached out and got the support of council members kaylos and powers, because ps59 straddles. If anybody knows that area, both council zones and sandy went to the department of transportation and to the local precinct rather and the local precinct has agreed to it, so we have the assumption that the loading dock at for whole foods there is accessible. So we have all of the players in place here. It's a lot of people put a lot of work into getting this reso rozzo already. I know other schools want to do a similar resolution, for I guess, 116 and 281 also want to do play streets, and I guess salk wants to do an open street and I will be completely honest and say: I'm not completely clear the difference between a play street that open street, but we have a shovel ready as it were resolution it's up for the ps59 request. That's I'll! Stop there all right, so this is colleen from DOT. If can I just clarify the play street in the open street? That would be great okay, so the play street would be more of a permanent thing that you are requesting, which would mean that you would have the street closed off for certain hours during the day, and you would have your staff manage the site they would have. You know to have barricades at both ends, and also you would allow you know, emergency response vehicles to go through that street or if a resident needs access to that street or if there is a local delivery. So that would be the responsibility of the school. The open street concept or open school is what principals are applying for, and that is for the outdoor learning due to covet. There is a link that we have been sending out to schools or principals for specific schools who are requesting that so that it so that they can complete a survey. Okay, great and I think adele schroeder is well aware of the need to you know, maintain the barricades we, I actually, my kids went to ps50 died and we've tried to get that. We've tried to get the street blocked multiple times and had failed and we're back at it again, but this time with the added incentive of you know the restrictions of Covid-19, the desirability of having kids not on top of each other as they try to enter the school building and all of the other issues that you know are now plus. The fact that 56th street, thanks to the residency of our president, is now blocked between fifth avenue at fifth avenue. So 56th street is no longer a complete through street, but this was rejected in the past and we tried to. We were told that 56th street was a thoroughfare that could not be blocked. Well, it's actually blocked now, so we feel we have a much stronger case to argue for this yeah and colleen again from d.o.t. I do recall in the past that the local presence was very supportive of this and that they did work with the school to allow for closure intermittent well, actually closures in the morning and in the afternoon dismissals for half an hour because of the busing. There was a lot of buses that came to pick up students there, and that was rejected. We wanted originally, we only. I don't want to rehash history, because everybody's tied is valuable here, but originally we just wanted it, for you know, drop off and pick up, and that was rejected as well, and we were very not happy about that. But that's so that's ancient history, correct sandy has a question and it's actually not a question, but it's a clarification that definitely this is a request for a play street and I think there are several other schools within the district who are looking for a similar, a similar goal to close the streets for certain periods- and I guess we ps 59- is a separate issue, but the other, the other schools. We thought we might write a resolution in support and just ask for expedited approval. Apparently, one school has applied and they've been waiting for over a month for a response, so I guess colleen. We might also ask you how we could help expedite these. These requests yeah. You know what sandy there's so many schools that are applying for this. So I mean, as they come in we're trying our best to respond to every school and keep in mind that the whole concept of play street and the reason why schools are applying for great play streets is because they don't have the additional space. For example, they don't have a gym in the school. That's why they're applying for like a play street play street is intended for students to come out for recreational activities during the day, because the school doesn't have a gym. So if the school needs the space, only as a staging area to enter and exit the school is that not a play street an appropriate application would be a play street or an open street. It would be more of an open school yeah, but I believe ps59 is very interested in using this. For I mean because the space inside the building is so constrained, they're very using this, for you know, recess and other activities of their kids. There's that there's that and if I can interject there's also the fact that we are living in the age of Covid-19 and the facilities they have are going to be overstressed by social distancing, that's going to be required when the children use those facilities and so the street, which wouldn't have been necessary under the previous dispensation in terms of space. It's going to be very it's a different situation now they're going to need that space and it's a very good part and had a question for sandy. Sorry, I'm sorry just to follow up then colleen should we recommend they apply to both programs. I would recommend that you apply to both. Yes, thank you, yeah and tandy I'll, forge you that language and the link, so you can share it with the school. Thank you, you're welcome and yeah. This makes sense when I was actually gonna say you know what jean said about the you know: kids and teachers needing all the outdoor space. While it's available, you know, while the weather permits and this street does seem like a pretty good one. My own one question that I just want to make sure it's kind of been considered is that I think there's a pretty big city bike station on that block, and I don't know if that could be a problem of like kids, playing and people jumping on bikes, and I will not say anything that would anyway. Just you know encourage the removal of a of a city bike station, but I do think it's something that it at least needs to be like that interaction. It needs to be considered. So, yes, I think that's a good point. It's always going to be there and, as brian pointed out with regard to the earlier resolution, these are issues that are always going to be with us, but I don't think that those obstacles, no not a bit just a consideration. Yeah andrew thanks, I'm just thinking about this in a in a kind of a long-term holistic way, and I'm you know- and I always want you know, kids have the ability to you know have outdoor time and space, but, and I'm also just thinking about like the responsibilities of the department of education, what they should, probably you know be doing or advocating for on their side. I guess my question is this: are we looking at this as a long-term, permanent solution to turn? You know, like you know, every time a school wants to create a play street and shut down a street you know are we are we sort of going into this precedent we're going to do that every single time permanently or we are we thinking about this numbers of Covid-19? You know, is this more of a temporary solution to allow the students to be outside because covet is preventing them right now. You know I'm just I'm just sort of. I guess I'm differentiating between. Are we looking at this short term or long term with that precedence issue so andrew, it's colleen, so the play street would be more of a long term. It'll be permanent, whereas the open school is temporary because of cobit understood. I'm sorry, I thought I thought play streets were done on a an academic year and it was sort of an automatic renewal, but if there's problems it can be rescinded. They're done with they are allowed. When school is in session. That's correct! That's only when school is in session, but and yes they can be rescinded if the school is not complying, that's correct! So sorry, just can I ask a point of clarification. What are we in this resolution? Then? I just want some clarification. Are we supporting then a place a play street for this school? That would only be during the hours of the operation of the school permanently, or is this something that's only during covet? I just I just wanted to just want to clarify what we're asking for the school's application asks for a permanent play stream. I mean adele's application. Let me just find it here. I'm looking at it to be sure nope there's nothing in her application. I have a copy of it, which has been shared with others on the committees. That would say it's. Temporary okay sandy also had her hand up again andrew. I don't think it's an ideal condition to have the children playing in the street, so I actually had the opportunity to speak to matt about this resolution and it's really only meant to be a temporary solution while they where they can use it as staging and where their gymnasium is being used for other purposes. If sandy, if I can just reply, I think that I think what you're describing personally makes a lot of sense to me. I just don't again, I just don't know if that's, if that's reflected in the wording here, you know. I agree in essence with what you're saying I think it's a matter of trusting the school and the principal and the parents to know. What's the appropriate solution for this particular school yeah, I think that's, I think, that's a very good point I mean adele has been principal of the school schroeder has been principal in the school forever. They have a very active. You know parent leadership, they're gonna. They want to do what's in the best interest of the kids. You know and that's I think, as sandy just said, we need to have a certain amount of trust for that. I think hi, claire cb6 member matt bondy helped draft this resolution and interrupted us yeah, and I had a similar question to him. So matt asks why is that a restaurant can close traffic lanes with near immediate approval, but schools have to wait months for approval when children are at risk and need space to exercise and arrive and disburse safely from school. Why were businesses given expedited access to open streets and schools are having to wait months? I think that might if colleen can answer that question for us hi so keep in mind. We have to follow the directives of the mayor and we did the open restaurant in june, and that was to help the businesses you know rebound from the loss that they were incurring due to covet and what we've allowed for them to do or have is the outdoor dining in the curb lane and on the sidewalk spaces, not every restaurant that applied qualified for this, because either there was a bike share station or there was a bike lane or there was a bus stop. So we were not able to help every restaurant statewide to implement this now with the school. The open schools, the issue with that is that we have been getting a lot of requests just like with the restaurants, and we have to do our surveys and analysis to determine which schools are feasible in order to allow for any closure whatsoever. It's not as easy to close a street down because it affects the network of the traffic and surrounding streets. So that's why it's taking time and again we! You know the city follows the directive of city hall. We just can't make decisions without not consulting. You know with city hall. Can I ask a question yeah. Thank you. Thank you for that response. I think, though, that you have to prioritize the children and, just like you have to get the restaurants back up and in business, which I fully support. We have an obligation to support our children and to get them back into school in a safer way, as we possibly can. So the notion that this is a city directive coming from the mayor that you have to take your real, you know close look at how it might affect traffic patterns. To me. I think that you have to prioritize the children more than anything else right now and that you have to you have to ensure that they have a place to arrive safely and to disperse from school safely and that you give them an opportunity to distance themselves during the day for gym and recreation, because you know these are terrible times, and you really. You really have to do everything you possibly can the kids and what you have here and as a parent of two children that go to ps59 or one that recently graduated is a situation when you have very small sidewalks and you have everybody arriving even with staggered times, even with staggered arrival times, it's a very crowded endeavor, and so you really. You really have to keep that in mind, and you have to keep in mind too that when the city did the deal with the developer to develop a high-rise building on the avenue, they only have so many open spaces that are rooftop open spaces. So, in order to get to those spaces, you need to take the stairs and I believe, they're, on the seventh floor, the sixth and the seventh floor. So you can't get into the school elevators and properly socially distance yourselves. So these kids are going to be expected to walk seven flights of stairs or, however many they might be. You know, depending on what floor they're already on, to get out to a place to play, and we have this opportunity on 56th street having grown up and lived on. I was born on 60th street. I lived there for 42 beautiful years, 60th and 2nd avenue, and I currently live on 56th street, and so I know a little something about 56th street. It is one of the least trafficked blocks in our entire neighborhood, and you know it's not only a function of the president's residence closing down the street between fifth and madison avenue, but it's historically been a very quiet block. So here you have this really prime opportunity to help the kids and it shouldn't just be limited to ps59 and the beekman hill school and art and design and the district 75 school that it also serves and the hundreds of kids that go to the pre-k center around the corner. I think what the resolution says is that you have 2 000 kids, that arrive every day and with you know, you know the number those numbers may be different now, but it should be a city-wide directive that you do whatever you can during these times to open these streets for these children, because you know we have no higher calling than to do this for them at this time. So you know that I'm a little bit bothered by your response to that. It comes from city hall because what city hall should be doing is advocating for our children. It's a combination of city hall and the department of education. D.O.T cannot take it upon itself to make these decisions. We have to consult with other agencies as well, just like with open restaurants. We have to consult with other agents. We need to consult with the department of health as well as small businesses. You know, I sympathize and I really do understand what you're saying the priority are: the children and we're working. You know to the best of our ability to look at all of these streets and to see what can be done and we are going to be responding to all of the schools that have applied just so you know, but by but by when, because school starts in a couple of weeks and it should have been decided already. You know right when school went out in april when they were told actually march and they were told that it's only going to be until april 20th and then they found out that it was canceled for the remainder of the school year. Immediate thought should have gone into. How are we going to socially distance these kids in five months from now, and so you know that it hasn't been done already also bothers me, but the thought hold on the thought that were prioritizing restaurants over children is offensive to me. So I think it's just like this. You know what don't shoot the messenger, because we're not doing that. You know the fact remains that you know school opening of the school was has been delayed and we're not prioritizing restaurants over children. So, no we're not doing that. That's not what we're doing. Okay! Thank you, colleen for your response. I think we need to call the question yeah. I think we call it a question and I it's, I think, we're all aware that you know the opening of schools is a separate question which my committee will take up at its next meeting. But I'd like to call can I call a question I could just sandy mckee request the floor. Oh okay, I wonder I'm sorry I wanted. I was going to call the question. I second then regard whoever you go. It's up to you, okay, so we can vote in support of this resolution. It seems okay, all right, claire brennan, abstain for cause, gene santoro or okay. That was four. Thank you joan barronbaum laura!

One abstention, one not entitled this motion carries thanks to all who did all the work on it sandy matt claire. Thank you very much yeah and thanks again sandy, I just emailed you the link for the open schools. If you can share it with the school as well, it will be great if both is done. Okay, yes, perfect speak! Is that the same as the DOE application, the open street application? Yes, it is. Thank you. Thank you. Everybody you're welcome. Okay, great moving on to the fourth agenda item here, a discussion on a possible resolution regarding the blockage of city streets by the new york city police department. I'm not sure, if folks have noticed, but the 13th and 17th precinct has put up barricades on 21st street and 51st street and not allowing folks to pass through unless they live on the block or are visiting a business on the block and the board office actually sent a letter back in july to commissioner shea and did not get a response on this. So this discussion is not intended to be an open discussion about policing in the city. There is space for that elsewhere. This is really just thinking about these two particular streets and potentially creating a resolution to request that they reopen the streets for everyone, so ryan had something that he wanted to add so, okay yeah. I just wanted to give my observation that the 13th precinct, which is around the corner from where I live, they've, had both 20th and 21st streets, blocked off they've, converted nearly all of 20th street into personal parking for the NYPD placards in personal cars and whatnot. That's basically something NYPD allows itself to do, but it's not something that they're supposed to do. They they have generally allowed vehicles through, but they've, been kind of giving especially drivers kind of a big pause and a hard time to do. This. They've been parking equipment still out on second avenue. So if they're so concerned about equipment being damaged, they clearly don't really care about what the fate is of stuff. That's parked on 21st and 20th and 2nd avenue. As a matter of fact, the other day the 13th parked a lighting rig directly in the middle of the sidewalk on 21st street, preventing handicapped access to the north side of the street right near where the corner of the petersfield building is so basically there's a process that they need to follow to do this, but they haven't followed that process, and it looks like that. They're doing a full street closure. Meanwhile, I saw a report on twitter last week that not only is the 17th precinct doing this on 51st, but they actually printed their own banner. That said, NYPD checkpoint to hang at the location. So again it's kind of like you know, we don't know what they're doing they haven't come to us. They haven't made any explanations of this. A lot of people have already called attention to this and said there doesn't seem to be a reason for this and they can't just take over a street the law. The charter does not allow for them to take over street. They have to go through d.o.t. On this we may want to get some context from colleen if NYPD has coordinated with them for the 13th and the 17th. If we do put out, if we do consider a result on this, it should be a reso that says that we want these streets back open to the public, because we don't see anything happening right now. That would cause them to need these streets to be closed. Hi brian, it's colleen. So what you're experiencing in your community board cb4 is also experiencing the same thing with streets that are being closed by NYPD for no reason whatsoever, and I think initially this was done during the protest over the summer, but these streets should remain open. They should not be closed for any reason whatsoever and NYPD should not be using 20th street for their personal parking, because we allocate x amount of spaces for NYPD to park their vehicles on the streets, and that is their marked vehicles, not their personal vehicles, but we know that again, you're asking NYPD to self enforce themselves, so these streets should remain open and no, they did not get permission from DOT I mean I can imagine christine read you guys. The riot act actually christine also wrote a letter to the commissioner of NYPD, and I don't know if they received a response. Thank you for that context. Colleen andrew you had a question yeah more suggestion. I am, I certainly understand initially why NYPD close the streets down. You know my imagination, as we said before, we don't really know exactly without them telling us, but my imagination was that was their concern about police stations being attacked like in, like other cities that happened in the u.s during the protests. You know I, and I think it's regrettable- that there wasn't a response from the commissioner's office. However, I think is my opinion. I think that it would be appropriate to approach the the ncos, the community officers from the precincts to at least allow them to explain their rationale as to what you know you know as to give their restaurants why it's still happening you know I tend to, and I understand, the police are not always correct, obviously, and they make a lot of mistakes and sometimes, but I think that would be good to clarify with our local liaisons to hear from them. You know what it is before we go ahead and make the call on this. That's just my view. I think that some insight from matt, who I wish was here but he's not right now, was that it is in response to excuse me, police violence in other cities and earlier this summer here, but we did not get an official response from anyone from the precincts or the commissioner. I think, reaching out to the precinct is different than the commissioner. I think it might be a different response if we reached out to the precinct, that's what I'm implying just to quickly interject. The letter was sent to the commanding officers of both the 13th and the 17th precincts, and we did not receive a response from either commanding officer thanks brendan and was your hand raised in oh you're, on mute and you're on mute. We can't hear you and sorry I'm sorry. I think I was unmuting at the same time. You were on muting me, so I just I wanted to confirm that this is happening at 51st street too, and honestly on that for the 17th precinct. They have always parked personal vehicles there, like you, see them, it's just always there and it it's even tougher, because it adds to traffic loads, and that is a bike lane, and so you know there's issues there, but I would I also have wondered as andrew was saying like reaching out. I would like to hear what they have to say about it. One of my kind of biggest issues, though, is like, if they're doing it a little bit sort of sub rosa. It's like it's not gonna, be marked on google maps or something that it's closed. It's gonna be more, so people are gonna, get there and then they're gonna end up like circling the block, and so it just adds more to congestion, which I can testify. It's not it's, perhaps not back to pre-covet levels. It's we'll see what happens after labor day but business. You know, traffic is up and people are driving because they don't want to take the subway. So I think anything, that's adding to congestion that doesn't have a sort of good reason. We should push back on a little bit thanks ann sandy. I would like to reiterate that we have asked them to respond locally for both precincts and they have not. Matt has been generous enough to give some other conclusions. He mentioned that the general assembly is taking place in a few weeks and they think that our president may attend. No general assembly is cancelled. That's not what he's thinking the president may actually come to for an address, so that's just unfortunately, matt is not here, but that was one of the that's accurate. Just I'm telling you is the fact that you just said it's accurate, so there's some concern, especially I guess about the 51st. I still think we as a community should ask or should make it known that we do not appreciate this. We really want the use of the street, so I'd like to call the question in a reso that just asked the NYPD to open these streets again for the community. Second, just to interrupt. There is one sort of comment and question from a member of the public. Is it in support or against it? It's in support support. You know it yeah just quickly a question. This resident asked was in addition to responding to the current situation. Is there anything else we can do to improve the walkability of blocks with police precincts? Recent attempts to crack down placard abuse have been unsuccessful, so I'm thinking along the lines of replacing all free parking with metered parking, adding sidewalk furniture, trees, planters, bike, racks, etc. I think we can add something to the resolution kind of thinking more generally maybe, but that is a duly noted request. So are folks interested in voting on creating a resolution in support of kind of expressing our feelings on there yeah. I was going to second sandy's call to question so okay. So, let's vote on creating the resolution, hello, I will call your name and you may answer in favor against abstain or not entitled when your name is called claire brennan in favor. Thank you, gene santoro, in favor. Thank you joan berenbaum in favor. Thank you beat disman. She gets left charles fernandez, charles fernandez, four. Thank you, andrew gross favor, all right, that's in favor! Thank you! Molly hollister, not here yusuf khalid, not here sandra mckee in favor. Thank you. Phil napolitano. Not here matt roberts, not here larry shire for the all right, that's in favor, thank you and seligman in favor all right, thank you, brian venue and hogan in favor. Thank you, ronnie white, not here bob cohen, not here james wilson, james. If you don't meet yourself ray knowles, not here, okay, well with nine in favor, no against no extensions, no, not entitled this motion carries great. Does anyone want to volunteer to draft the reso, or maybe two people go work together on this? Whoever volunteers, the office can send you a draft a copy of the letter, so you can base that use that as a basis yeah. Since I wrote the letter, I I'm happy to write the result. Okay, thanks candy, I'm happy to always help with like editing or you know, just take taking a final look at it at erezzo for sandy. If you're, writing too, I can certainly edit you actually ann, always edits more ann and jean or both I'm part of my editing team. Thank you makes the dream work here. Thank you very much and I apologize. I went out of order for this agenda. You all have to excuse me first time doing this, but now we are going to continue our discussion of the resolution that requested that DOT assess converting some commercial metered parking spaces to general metered parking in community district, six and and andrew worked on this resolution. So it would be great if one of you could say a few words about it. Now I don't know who wants to talk but andrew you go for it all right, I'll defer to and then for any clarification. Maybe we can pull up the the resident so that we, the questions, can come fairly here. Basically, so, with an in mind, we basically took a look and asked, and actually in an email, claire and sandy, I said I want to try to keep this short, it's a pretty short rezo and actually thanks to ann for her editing. We just spoke about editing, who really kind of helped to pieces together. I think in a much more concise and also simplified way, we're basically asking here for d.o.t just to take an assessment of our parking meters to basically take a look and see if we've got an overabundance of commercial parking to take a look at. You know in this case like how the meters, sorry, how have us for the signages, if it's appropriate and had wanted to take a look as well at not just commercial parking with diplomatic parking, which I know could be complicated, but it's there and the the idea again behind this was to create what I call you know, equity and parking, and that you know if there's, if there's, if there's commercial parking and no one's using it, then we should allow you know people to park. You know let the public use those spaces if no one's there, if indeed DOT, does find out through taking a look at the usage of our cases. That, indeed, you know there is a very high demand for the commercial parking and that there's you know no room for changing signage, then so be it leave it, but we're again we're simply asking DOT to just come in and take an assessment of our our parking signage, and was that a was that a fair assessment, I don't know, feel free to add. That sounds like a great description. I also just want to add as an aside, while I'm speaking for a second thanks to colleen and I'm sure she's got a lot of tough things on her plate these days, but appreciation for her work. As always. Thank you. You'll note that just one thing I'll note is that you know this is very much in context with a resolution that we had passed just five months ago, sort of asking for a broader look at how herbs curbsides are used. You know in the district, and we recognize you know how stretch thin DOT is now how much is going on, although, as it also seems like stuff, is getting done faster than ever. So I you know kudos to you on that, but this is very much in conformity with other things and maybe it's just a little bit of a more focused request, but it's very consistent with something that the board has already asked for thanks dan, we have a question from larry. Yes, I am very concerned about the DOT being stretched as far as resources go, especially since at this moment they're being asked to prioritize the open streets and other immediate projects. I do want to say that it's a good idea to consider these things, but I'm not sure that pressing forward at this particular time also because things are very much in flux and we don't know how patterns will change in the next six months. Whether a study of this for the period going forward really is going to be helpful, I can I can respond or declare sure take andrew, I mean, I think I think the fact I mean I'll just speak really. I think I think the fact that we voted in favor of a you know: 200 million dollar bridge and you know, and that that's going to also be in the future, and we talked about looking forward. I think this also is you know looking forward and if colleen feels that the d.o.t you know can't handle this, you know I would defer to her, but certainly you know it's we're not we're not saying this should be done tomorrow. It just it should be done. You know it should be done at some point and I would defer to colleen then to answer if you know, if it's something that you know when or how but good dog's responsibility yeah, you know what you know. Larry raises an interesting point there, because we really are stretched with what we can do and again with the resources that we have right now, because we're prioritizing we're trying to prioritize a lot of the safety projects that we have presented to the community boards, and there have been some cutbacks that you know we have to deal with and I'll be honest with you andrew. I don't think this is going to be a priority for us at the moment, but not to say the least, that the community board should not put this in writing and send a resolution to DOT asking us to take a look at this. You know whether it's next month or whether it's three months from now, you know, but I would. I would like to stress that you should have a specific area in mind. Don't make the resolution too broad because we don't have the resources to go out there to do all of that work. I would just you know, define a specific area that you would like us to look at. First, I think that's, I think, that's something that ann and I actually had discussed at one point about. If we wanted to look at a specific area, I don't know, and if you want you're muted in yeah, actually totally my bad, because the reso should say assess in midtown east, not in community district. Six. Yes, that's like totally my bad that I we discussed that change, but I didn't make it so colleen, knowing that and I actually had discussed and intended to have midtown east specifically added in here. Would that would with that? Would that perhaps change the calculus of the capability of d.o.t to take a look in the future? I would, I would put it in such a way where you have like a limit, like you know, starting from a specific street or a quarter, maybe within five blocks radius instead of midtown east, because midtown east is very broad. I would start off small to have us do the survey so doing so like if we said you know sort of 52nd to maybe not 50 seconds, maybe 50th to 44th east of east of third or something like that. Yeah is that is that what you're? Looking for yeah define the area that you want us to? Look at and remember keep it small, because you know we don't have the resources to look at the whole midtown east right. Okay, we can take it from there and see the usage we can see if the usage is well worth it exactly in the space the curbside space. Exactly so procedurally, then claire would we come back. Would we would- and I edit that and come back with it with a or I don't know this has is or if we right, I like, actually I'm not so sure on that, but sandy has her hand up so hopefully she can provide some clarity. I'd like to call the question that we support this resolution and we modify it to give specific areas, but that we do support the resolution. Second, great okay, so we will now take a vote on supporting this resolution by roll call. So when your name is called unmute yourself. Thank you. Okay, when I call your name, please vote in favor against abstain or not entitled claire brennan abstain for cause. Gene santoro. Four! Thank you joan barronbaum in favor. Thank you be dismantled, not here charles fernandez, charles fernandez, against, okay, andrew gross in favor.

Thank you, andrew and anne for your work on the result, laura. Thank you and colleen. Thank you. So next item is the review of a red light. Camera request for 54th street and sudden place and signage for 53rd street and the fdr drive sandy. I'm wondering if you could speak a little to this. Yes, these were requests that were made by the at the last police council meeting from the sutton place. Residence and specifically 53rd is an exit from the fdr and it merges with sutton place that so the exit, sutton place and 53rd street had a fairly funky junction and we'd like the d.o.t to study. If there's a way to deal with that right now, it's almost impossible to cross the street there. If you happen to walk down 53rd street on the south side and you get all the way down to the fdr there's. The cars are traveling at very high speed and it's extreme it's difficult to cross the street. So that's what they're! Looking for thanks, candy anne has her hands up yeah. I just want to point out that there's also a playground there at like where that exit is off 53rd street. So it's like a little bit extra dangerous, but I also think didn't we ask for this like years ago and we asked I think we asked for a crosswalk there and you know again in the spirit of d.o.t being overwhelmed. We just like to get this as a as something that in the future, if they can study, especially now that the the greenway is going forward in that location, a lot of people will be utilizing this area, so it may be future planning, but it's just something. We want the DOT to look at so we'd like to put it into a resolution and that's a great idea sandy you're right. Absolutely right. Can I call the question? Yes, you can. So I call the question that we asked the DOT to study this area and in lieu of the future developments and to study the existing conditions. Should we renew our request for a crosswalk there at the same time? Absolutely okay. So let's vote on this resolution. Jesus all right! This is the 54th street in second place reza. Yes, all right when I call your name, please vote in favor against abstain or not entitled claire brennan not entitled. Thank you! Gene santoro, oh I'm entitled and I'm in favor. Okay, thank you joan barrenbaum in favor. Thank you b, dismantle that is left charles fernandez. Four. Thank you, andrew gross favor. Thank you. Molly hollister not here, yusuf khalid, not here sandy mckee in favor. Thank you, phil napolitano, not here matthew roberts up here, larry shire in favor. Thank you and seligman in favor. Thank you, brian venue and hogan brian ben you and hoping I'm okay. That was a very low, but I think that was in favor ronnie white. Not here bob cohen, not here, here's wilson, not here spring knolls, not here we have eight in favor and one not entitled this motion carries. Thank you! Jesus, okay, colleen! It's your time to shine here. Thank you for bearing with us. There were a few things that we had mentioned that we wanted an update on. So if let me know what you want, I think sandy had emailed me a list right. Yes, danny! Do you have that list in front of you, because I'm in my kitchen right now [Laughter], let me pull it up too. Yes, so we were asking about the city bike station at east, 15th and third avenue. So that's the city bike station that we've gotten quite a few complaints about and we have city bike. Actually, our bike share division is looking into it and we should have a response by early next week for the board we've. We also received complaints from, I think from quite a few elected officials as well of residents complaining about the station and the fact that it blocks the building main entrance. If I'm not mistaken, so bear with me- and you know, I will get you all a response by early next week. Okay, thank you and then the temporary bike lane on 2nd avenue we've witnessed members of our board has seen it. You know the barrels on the sidewalk citizens have kind of taken action and fixed the lane themselves. So I was wondering if there was any. Let me I know with the barrels I know: they've been moved and they're pretty much uncomfortable with that area. They feel that it's not safe. I will check to see what we can do in the meantime. If there's any other measures that we can take or anything that we can install there to make it more safe colleen. We really appreciate that because it's members of the board who've been keeping the barrel as well as just regular citizens, keeping the barrels more or less sort of some of the time kind of where they're supposed to be, because they've been moved consistently and ted mentioned when he was here the last time that they can only really come around kind of. Maybe, if they're lucky once a week more like a couple of times a month and that's clearly not going to cut it, because these things are moving daily, so we'd appreciate whatever upgrade you can give us that would be even somewhat more permanent than those barrels. Thank you with borough, commissioner pinkar we'll put our heads together and we'll see what we can do, because and thank you committee members for putting those battles back. That means a lot. Thank you, yeah, and just continuing on that topic we did kind of. We did resolve to request a more permanent solution there on second avenue, so was there any status on creating a more permanent solution like we see uptown by the bridge? Right and again our I know, our bike team is working on a you know, permanent solution that they can share with the community board and when we do have something togeth put together we'll you know, let you know I'll, let you know, but I I'll follow up with them and I'll ask them what the timeline is with that and then we're looking about the status of the 38th and 39th street protected bike lanes that we're going in implementation is scheduled in september that that's actually going in real. Soon we have finalized the we we've finalized a lot of the outstanding issues that we've had with with our various divisions. So we are moving forward with implementation. There is no nothing preventing us from moving forward with that. So I would imagine, sometime in september, I think we sent out the what's happening here: flyer to the community board brendan sandy. Did you see that or jesus that colleen? That flyer ran in our newsletter yesterday. All right so good, yes and kimberly did send something to say that it was being implemented that they had started, which is great, but that it's a very long term it may she noted it may take a while, yes, because it spans three community boards right yeah and then. Finally, if you could give kind of a general update on the open streets program, will it continue? Can the parking be eliminated long term right? So what I know for sure is that open street it's a temporary program that we've put together because of the covet. I don't know if there are any plans to extend it. I have a feeling there. We might extend it, but as soon as again as soon as I have more information, I will share it with the board, but at the moment I have not heard of any plans to extend it. Thank you, colleen. We have a few questions from our committee members, so larry. Yes, first colleen, this is old business 14th street l, train restoration. The project is pretty much wrapped up except right. Now it's a kind of a no man's land around the bus stops I've seen people sitting in the new bus shelters, but the signs haven't been moved over. Restoring the bus stops at avenue a and avenue b to the original locations, and so I just wanted to call colleen's attention to that should take place sooner rather than later, along with bringing the ticket validation machines over, which is, as I understand it, mta's responsibility and then, once the 14th and b bus stop has been relocated. I'd like to know when the citibank station will be coming back to that northeast corner of 14 and b, and that's business, okay, great larry! Do me a favor. Can you send me an email tomorrow with the stops that you're asking us to look at restoring now that the work is completed, I'll, be happy to coordinate that with our bus, stop management and with mta and we'll start the paperwork? We'll start processing the paperwork? Yeah. I think I think you're pretty much ready to go except you want to move over your own signs. The new bus stop shelter is in place. I think over at avenue, b and avenue a I'll have to verify that. But can you verify that in some locations and with the city bank station as well and I'll confirm when we'll put the station back yeah for sure I'll do I'll do that for you tomorrow and I have an item of new businesses as long as I'm here? This is not a colleen question. This relates to the new york city ferry the route that was changed for stuyvesant cove used to be the lower east side route, and now it's the sound view route. Unfortunately, maybe the someone from the board can bring this to hornblower's attention that their new app doesn't work from the stuyvesant town and peter cooper village neighborhood. It doesn't tell you to go to the stuyvesant cove ferry, stop if you want to go to wall street instead, it sends you on a 22-minute walk up to 34th street so that you can just reverse course and stop at the ferry stop on your way down to wall street. That really is something that I've not been able to communicate either to hornblower on my own or to apple maps. Maybe somebody else in this group has some ideas, which is why I'm bringing it up? Okay, thanks larry. I think we can look into that ann. Had a question for colleen, specifically, yes, actually, I have a couple of questions. Three. In fact, one is about the painting of traffic lanes on first avenue, which was repaved like in the 50s months ago, and it is still bumper cars if you drive north on first avenue. So I'm just wondering if you have a timeline for when the lame painting will be done. What's the location and because I'll follow up with the contractor, you know it's. Basically, it's basically the 50s in first on first avenue like up to like 50 to 15. I think it gets better after 57, but it's like and there's a lot of traffic exchange in that stretch. So it's a little. It can be a little hairy, especially as traffic is getting worse, I'll, follow up with our geometric design and find out when that is scheduled to be implemented. Usually, what happens is that whenever we mill and pave a street, the markings will go in a few weeks later yeah. But it's been months. It's been months I'll raise that with them. That's why I'm raising it yeah, and the second issue is also about a paving issue that there's a problem that I have complained about this literally for years, but only did the really the right thing and put in a service request in july, but third avenue the east side of third avenue between 45th and 44th street, and I'm happy to give you the service request number. If you like. It's been closed, it was transferred to d.o.t, but the water pools there. It's sitting right outside. There are four restaurants there, one of whom I thought might the management might join us today and even if they did, they may have given up by now, but I literally changed my route so as not to walk down that street, because people hope you know it's where the restaurant garbage sits and not to get too graphic. But just imagine you know they hose it down and the water doesn't go anywhere, and so then it you know it sits baking for hours and it just it. You know it doesn't. It will never clear away- and I understand, there's an issue about it has to pull for more than seven days. It literally never goes away the it's there's a wendy there's a dunkin donuts, there's the beer house there and it just if anybody is familiar with that. It's just disgusting. I mean it really needs work. So this is the east side of third avenue between one and one 44th and 46th 44th and 45th. Just to give you an insight about ponding conditions, we get a lot of complaints about ponding conditions, city-wide and, to be honest with you, they are tough locations to tackle, because the only time that we can pretty much address the ponding condition. It's usually when we would do some wear and tear work or when we mill and pave the street. In some cases there might be a catch basin, that's missing in the corner, which does not provide for an outlet for the water to flow in this case. In this case, the restaurant owners are washing their sidewalk and they're leaving no, but the problem is that it doesn't get to the corner. It's not that the drainage is blocked between it's sort of more mid blocks. If the drainage is blocked, then dep should come out there and clean the catchphrase. No, it's that's what I'm saying it's. That is not the problem. The drainage is not blocked, and I this problem, I think, actually was created the last time that street was paved and it just. There was just an issue with the way it you know it didn't. There was just a little bit of a glitch in it, so it really, but you know like I, just I walk by there on an 85 degree day and you will cross the street it's and I feel terrible because you know beer house is trying to have outdoor dining there, and you know it smells like it smells like rotten garbage. Even and like I say it's, not the business's fault, they try and sweep the water away after they've done it. Just it doesn't have a place to go because the there really is a problem. It's not a drainage issue in that, like it never gets to the drains at the corners yeah, but if they're sweeping it, where are they sweeping it too? If you're surfing, they're, basically sort of like trying to sweep it out into the street in hopes that it'll make it there, but it's really it's like there. It will never flow from that. The next time you're out there. Can you email me a photo. I can. I have plenty of photos. I will. I will and I'll give you the exact location. The third question I had was a question that I think the board office asked you, but I'm not sure they got an answer which is about what the bus lanes are painted with, because I had a like seriously adverse reaction and I'm sure you do all kinds of toxicity tests, but I was just kind of curious to be like well. What is that like? Is this something I should look into for my own personal health and it seems like a pretty straightforward question and we didn't get an answer and that made me want to pursue it a little bit more. So I don't know the mixture of the paint that we use. I mean I do know that we've used this particular brand citywide to paint the bus lane, and I do know for sure that it's not toxic, because we would not the city would not use a material right yeah, but still I'd like to know what it is. Because I mean this may be an issue that I personally have and again it seems like this should not be secret information right. No, how do I find this out? It's really not secret information, I mean, if you really want to pursue it, I would suggest that you submit a foil request. Okay, and I guess that's what may I can follow up with you, but it's like if I have to submit a foil request to get this. That makes me think. Oh my god, there is something to hide like that kind of scares me no, nothing too high. We would not jeopardize. Of course. I know that citizens in Manhattan by using a paint, that's toxic, I mean, then that would be a liability issue for us, of course, but seriously I did have a pretty bad reaction. So just saying what was the reaction? Was it something did you? It was like extreme gi experiences and a really bad headache like when I first smelled it and then a couple of days later or about a day or two later I was still off gassing and I came home and immediately got a headache that lasted about 12 hours, oh wow, so yeah. So it's like, I mean sir, like you do not want to know the details of the gi all right and I will try my best to see what it is. What's inside the mixture I don't know I'll, follow up with you and I'll. Send you the pictures on third avenue perfect. Thank you. You're! Welcome! I'm glad you're feeling! Thank you. Yes, I'm sorry short and nasty. Okay. Thank you, anne for those questions thanks and I'm sorry to have been so extraordinarily active on your first night as chair, but whatever actually claire is doing a perfect job. Thank you, colleen. Thank you. Everyone andrew you wanted to yeah, yes yeah. This is for colleen and it's really a new business item. Sure, and so you know I I've noticed a couple things. It's all one question, beginning at the towards the beginning of open sorry of I'm getting I'm tired at the beginning of sorry, yeah open streets, I guess the and the outdoor dining. Let's call it. You know we have a cluster of businesses, restaurants on third avenue, you're, probably aware colleen like in the 50s, and you know they they've advocated as a group they've presented to us as a group before, and you know we were supportive of their efforts and you know without debating the future of outdoor dining or whatever the I was chatting with one of the owners, and you know basically just said hey like how's it going. What's your experience been and I've had the pleasure of sitting outside many nights on third avenue eating in our local restaurants, and this owner had basically said. Look one of my fears is that we're gonna have a car accident or something's gonna happen with the city bus, because you know the streets colleen, as we all know, we're, not we're not designed for what we're using them for right now, we've found a very quick solution. Again we could debate good or bad, but we found a quick solution to implementing, and what's really happened is in addition to the fears of this owner of having a serious accident we've actually seen. You know I've seen them in the news. There have been several incidents where you know cars have gone into outdoor dining. There was this pretty serious one on second avenue in the 90s right. If I recall there was a collision and a car actually went through the wood that restaurant had used and went right through, like, I think, multiple restaurants. So I'm not I'm not suggesting that you know we should get rid of our outdoor dining. You know, personally, I think it's needed and for a lot of reasons, but I think the challenge is in my question: you colleen is there some way or could we put up a resolution to help that tries to standardize or asks for DOT to maybe think of creative solutions to improve the safety, or at least the standardization of the outdoor dining? If we're going to have it for longer again whether that means the way that they're identified like visually whether that means the city has like- and I know this may sound crazy, whether there's you know like more like concrete or other types of like physical barriers that could be moved and then removed later on, I don't know, but I'm just open-minded to how can we improve the safety? So we don't have a big tragedy. You know where people's lives are lost. You know on the streets, I know, and you know what andrew that's something we don't want. God forbid, but you know when we initiated the outdoor dining program. There was a lot of thought that came into play with, of course, safety because keep in mind you know patrons, are sitting in the curb lane and that's why we requested these restaurants to submit the layout that they were putting out there and we required. You know sturdy barriers. You know that interlock so that you know that prevented. You know cars from going through or hurting, and you know pedestrians who are sitting out there or or patrons who are sitting out there. I I'll be honest with you. I mean there is no one quick solution. I've seen the news as well. I've seen the accident that happened in Brooklyn. Thank god. You know you know that was then you know involved any fatality, and I guess what I should tell you or what you probably would like to hear that you know. I don't know if this is going to be something permanent because keep in mind that you know. I think this program is up until october, which is when we have. We still have good weather and even if it does become permanent, we are going to be looking at a solid plan that will focus, of course, on safety and I'm sure that it will be standardized, but also keep in mind that each location is unique in its own way. There are some locations that can have the curbside, dining and some locations that cannot have it, whereas some locations can have. You know outdoor dining on the sidewalk because they have a wide sidewalk, whereas others can't have it because their sidewalk is very narrow. So I think all of that will come into play and we're just gonna have to. You know figure that out when that time comes again. If this is going to be something permanent and of course we have to look at the safety you know measuring will want to implement to make this a standardized. You know concept so colleen. If I, if I can just summarize and again, thank you for that, it sounds like what you're. What you're saying to us is that there's no action that you see from our side now, but that in the future this issue may come up depending on the outcome of the of the outdoor dining. Well, there's no action at the moment because we've got you know restaurant owners to have safety barricades out there, which is what we think you know will help, but I guess in the future, if this becomes more permanent. Of course, there's going to be more of a solid structure out there that's going to be standardized. You know, okay thinking, thank you, but at the moment I don't know I have. I don't have a definitive answer for you. I really don't. That sounds like the answer that it sounds like there's nothing for us to do right now on this correct, which is an answer. Thank you. Thank you sandy. I just wanted to say I did ask matt who has a contact with the 17th police precinct. If there had been any accidents in our neighborhood, there have not been, and it sounds like you know. Restaurant owners actually have come up with a pretty good solution which is to park car in front of any of the open, dining areas that they can not. All of them are able to do that, but that seems to be a good solution. Yeah and restaurant owners are being very creative too. When it comes to protecting their patrons, I mean I just don't see them being negligent. I mean and also know that you know these acts these crashes, how they occurred. It's you know motorist negligence, that's what it is. It's not the multiple crimes, just to be clear, colleen I just deserve. I I'm not suggesting that it's the restaurant's fault that there's actually neither am I no you're right, absolutely yeah. Okay, thank you and is your hand raised you just muted yourself. Yes, no, I was just going to say I know. Gail brewer has been having this contest of like the most creative. She, I think it says sidewalk, but I think it's both sidewalk and sort of curbside dining, and so you know this may be something that the borough president's office is a good resource because they will have seen so many different configurations that you know there may be some learning going on there that it's worth reaching out to them. So I don't know if that's something that can maybe come up and borrow board or something just a thought. Thanks, ann okay, so I am going to waive my report seeing as it's 9 15 and I don't really have much more to say anyway, but does anyone have any older new business that you all want to bring up? I'm seeing some head shakes, I'm going to give you a few more seconds to wait, raise your hand but I'll. Take that as a no now thank you, everyone, oh abby, did you have anything to report from health and education? No. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. So is there a motion to adjourn this meeting? Okay again, thank you, anne. If there are no objections here, we will adjourn the meeting. Thank you all, seeing none and no further business. The meeting is adjourned at 9 16 p.m. Thank you all for the title have a good night and we will see you soon. Congratulations claire! Thank you. Anne.
