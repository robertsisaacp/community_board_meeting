We could have a separate meeting about that, but that brought the park down from when I was working on this previously from over 200 million to about 100 million and depending on the ramps on the Manhattan and the queen side and connection to roosevelt island, we're looking at probably 150 million dollars Now, just imagine from midtown Manhattan.
If you were driving northbound on the fdr drive in the vicinity of the u.n, you would suddenly be diverted to this roadway out into the river Then you'd come back at around 61st street and that allowed the city to work on the fdr drive itself to close an entire roadway at a time so that at first they close the northbound roadway fix that roadway.
You know the touchdown point for the cars we want to be the touchdown point for the pedestrians and the bicyclists, and I wholeheartedly support the 48th street location.
I, absolutely think we should support this, and when it comes to that point, I am going to vote for a resolution and support.
It, I would be prioritizing the east side esplanade over this You. Even you know, raised the issue about the you know: If, we have money and it's a lot harder to get the developers to pay for that, and the un certainly isn't going to So you know, I guess, I'm, happy to support it, but just not if it, if there's kind of any chance of it being at the expense literally of the greenway.
Where, there's already they're already the development of the 53rd street And I support the greenway around Manhattan island- I've been working on that since the 1970s.
Would it substantially have to change the engineering and the cost behind this bridge if it was something like 26 to 30 feet, something along the lines of the walkway over the hudson, and I asked that not to debate the point, but just to say that you know we've seen nothing but terrible results from a lot of this mixed traffic stuff from bikes and pedestrians on stuff.
However, where the two intersect, I think, there's a opportunity to avoid conflict among pedestrians and bicycles by arranging for the bridge to approach Manhattan at a different level than the greenway, and that there would be a way to go from one to the other via ramps, and this would maybe even be elegant and attractive, as well as enabling people to remain safe by keeping them out of conflict with each other.
As you hear, today, people will offer many other solutions, but I think I would support a resolution for the concept and think it's important for new york city and its future bring up a good point about shovel ready.
Oh, wants to know what the touchdown on the roosevelt island section of the bridge would be what it would look like.
And, it seems like there was some interest in writing a resolution in support of this presentation and this work claire, sandy.
We're, going to be discussing a possible resolution regarding school play streets in our district, including a specific proposal for east 56th street between second and third avenue, I'm, not sure, john.
I know other schools want to do a similar resolution, for I guess, 116 and 281 also want to do play streets, and I.
It would be more of an open school For I mean because the space inside the building is so constrained, they're, very using this, for you, know, recess and other activities of their kids.
Don't know if that could be a problem of like kids, playing and people jumping on bikes, and I will not say anything And, as brian pointed out with regard to the earlier resolution.
And I, always want you, know, kids have the ability to you know, have outdoor time and space, but, and I'm also just thinking about like the responsibilities of the department of education, what they should, probably you know, be doing or advocating for on their side.
You know, like you know, every time a school wants to create a play street and shut down a street you know are We thinking about this numbers of Covid-19?
I, think hi, claire cb6 member matt bondy helped draft this resolution and interrupted us So. Why is that a restaurant can close traffic lanes with near immediate approval, but schools have to wait months for approval when children are at risk and need space to exercise and arrive and disburse safely from school.
Were businesses given expedited access to open streets and schools are having to wait.
We have to follow the directives of the mayor and we did the open restaurant in June, and that was to help the businesses you know rebound from the loss that they were incurring due to Covid-19 and what we've allowed for them to do or have is the outdoor dining in the curb lane and on the sidewalk spaces, not every restaurant that applied qualified for this, because either there was a bike share station or there was a bike lane or there was a bus, stop.
The issue with that is that we have been getting a lot of requests just like with the restaurants, and we have to do our surveys and analysis to determine which schools are feasible in order to allow for any closure.
I think, though, that you have to prioritize the children and, just like you have to get the restaurants back up and in business, which I fully support.
You have to ensure that they have a place to arrive safely and to disperse from school safely, and that you give them an opportunity to distance themselves during the day for gym and recreation, because you know these are terrible, times, And The kids and what you have here and as a parent of two children that go to ps59 or one that recently graduated is a situation when you have very small sidewalks You really have to keep that in mind, and you have to keep in mind too that when the city did the deal with the developer to develop a high-rise building on the avenue, they only have so many open spaces that are rooftop open, spaces.
I. Think what the resolution says is that you have 2 000 kids, that arrive every day and with you know , you know the number those numbers may be different now, but it should be a city-wide directive that you do whatever you can during these times to open these streets for these children, because you know we have no higher calling than to do this for them at this.
We're all aware that you know the opening of schools is a separate question which my committee will take up at its next meeting.
Moving on to the fourth agenda item here, a discussion on a possible resolution regarding the blockage of city streets by the new york city, police, department.
I'm, not sure, if folks have noticed, but the 13th and 17th precinct has put up barricades on 21st street and 51st street and not allowing folks to pass through unless they live on the block or are visiting a business on the block and the board office actually sent a letter back in July to commissioner shea and did not get a response on this.
This is really just thinking about these two particular streets and potentially creating a resolution to request that they reopen the streets for everyone, so ryan had something that he wanted to add.
If we do consider a result on this, it should be a reso that says that we want these streets back open to the public, because we don't see anything happening right.
But we know that again, you're asking NYPD to self enforce themselves, so these streets should remain open And I mean I.
So I'd like to call the question in a reso that just asked the NYPD to open these streets again for the community.
I was going to second sandy's call to question so Let's vote on creating the resolution, hello, I will call your name and you may answer in favor against abstain or not entitled when your name is called claire, brennan in favor.
You all have to excuse me first time doing this, but now we are going to continue our discussion of the resolution that requested that DOT assess converting some commercial metered parking spaces to general metered parking in community district.
I think the fact that we voted in favor of a you, know, 200 million dollar bridge Larry, raises an interesting point there, because we really are stretched with what we can do and again with the resources that we have right.
I. Don't think this is going to be a priority for us at the moment, but not to say the least, that the community board should not put this in writing and send a resolution to DOT asking us to take a look at this.
We wanted to look at a specific area, I, don't know, and if you want you're muted in Actually totally my bad, because the reso should say assess in midtown east, not in community district.
And again our I know, our bike team is working on a you know, permanent solution that they can share with the community board and when we do have something togeth put together, And I'll ask them what the timeline is with that Then we're looking about the status of the 38th and 39th street So I would imagine, sometime in september, I.
What I know for sure is that open street It's a temporary program that we've put together because of the Covid-19.
I'd like to know when the citibank station will be coming back to that northeast corner of 14 and b, and that's business, okay, great larry!
This problem, I think, actually was created the last time that street was paved and it just.
There was just an issue with the way It really, but you know, like I, just I walk by there on an 85 degree day and you will cross the street And I feel terrible because you know beer house is trying to have outdoor dining, there, Even and, like I, say it's, not the business's fault.
One of my fears is that we're gonna have a car accident or something's gonna happen with the city bus, because you know the streets colleen.
Is there some way or could we put up a resolution to help that tries to standardize or asks for DOT to maybe think of creative solutions to improve the safety, or at least the standardization of the outdoor dining?
Restaurant owners actually have come up with a pretty good solution, which is to park car in front of any of the open, dining areas that they can not.
