This is pedestrian, bicycle bridges and In, probably less than 10 minutes and happy to answer any questions and Henry Hamill Will work on this project and he'll be assisting me.
A number of engineers have worked together on the plans you're about to see next and bicycle riding to no one's surprise has been rising well before the Covid-19 outbreak, and we've been thinking for a long time how to get more people on bikes.
We could have a separate meeting about that, but that brought the park down from when I was working on this previously from over 200 million to about 100 million and depending on the ramps on the Manhattan and the queen side and connection to roosevelt island, we're looking at probably 150 million dollars.
If you were driving northbound on the Fdr drive in the vicinity of the U.N, you would suddenly be diverted to this roadway out into the river Then you'd come back at around 61st street and that allowed the city to work on the Fdr drive itself to close an entire roadway at a time so that at first they close, the northbound roadway fix that roadway.
You know good question, a project like this from concept to approval is five to seven years on average, so The money is not really needed in any large numbers until about 2027, and if you take a look at when the city did its most planning, it was during the great depression when we were in worse financial shape than we are right.
Whoever is ready, will get the money, and I think that New York should prepare itself should always be preparing itself for whenever that comes up, but right now, big money is not needed for this project right, Sam. Sure, and if I can answer one other thing long island city is huge development going on.
A great thing for our particular neighborhood You, know the touchdown point for the cars we want to be the touchdown point for the pedestrians and the bicyclists, and I wholeheartedly support the 48th street location.
I, absolutely think we should support this, and when it comes to that point, I am going to vote for a resolution and support.
And I asked that not to debate the point, but just to say that you know we've seen nothing but terrible results from a lot of this mixed traffic stuff from bikes and pedestrians on stuff.
However, where the two intersect, I think, there's a opportunity to avoid conflict among pedestrians and bicycles by arranging for the bridge to approach Manhattan at a different level than the greenway, and that there would be a way to go from one to the other via ramps, and this would maybe even be elegant and attractive, as well as enabling people to remain safe by keeping them out of conflict with each other.
As you hear, today, people will offer many other solutions, but I think I would support a resolution for the concept and think it's important for New York City and its future bring up a good point about shovel ready, In how New, York City was not ready and a lot of the shovel ready that we did spend was just repaving streets that were in pretty good condition, anyhow, because we were not ready with any innovative designs: new streets, new bridges, new plans.
Yes, I, see that so Mr Steve, oh, wants to know what the touchdown on the Roosevelt island section of the bridge would be what it would look like.
And, it seems like there was some interest in writing a resolution in support of this presentation and this work.
We're, going to be discussing a possible resolution regarding school play streets in our district, including a specific proposal for East 56Th street between second and third Avenue, I'm, not sure John.
I know other schools want to do a similar resolution, for I guess, 116 and 281 also want to do play streets, and I.
And I will be completely honest and say: I'm, not completely clear the difference between a play street that open street, but we have a shovel ready, as it were resolution Stop there all right.
That would be great okay, so the play street would be more of a permanent thing that you are requesting, which would mean that you would have the street closed off for certain hours during the day, and you would have your staff manage the site they would have.
Why they're applying for like a Play street play street is intended for students to come out for recreational activities during the day, because the school does not have a gym.
It's available, you know, while the weather permits and this street does seem like a pretty good one.
That I think there's a pretty big CitiBike station on that block, and I do not know if that could be a problem of like kids, playing and people jumping on bikes, and I will not say anything that would anyway.
And I, always want you, know, kids have the ability to you know, have outdoor time and space, but- And I'm, also just thinking about like the responsibilities of the Department of education, what they should, probably you, know, be doing or advocating for on their side.
You know every time a school wants to create a play street and shut down a street you know.
You, know parent leadership, they're going to I, think hi, Claire, CB6 member Matt Bondy helped draft this resolution and interrupted us So. Why is that a restaurant can close traffic lanes with near immediate approval, but schools have to wait months for approval when children are at risk and need space to exercise and arrive and disburse safely from school.
Were businesses given expedited access to open streets and schools are having to wait.
We have to follow the directives of the mayor and we did the open restaurant in June, and that was to help the businesses you know rebound from the loss that they were incurring due to Covid-19 and what we've allowed for them to do or have is the outdoor dining in the curb lane and on the sidewalk spaces, not every restaurant that applied qualified for this, because either there was a bike share station or there was a bike lane or there was a bus, stop.
The issue with that is that we have been getting a lot of requests just like with the restaurants, and we have to do our surveys and analysis to determine which schools are feasible in order to allow for any closure.
I think, though, that you have to prioritize the children and, just like you have to get the restaurants back up and in business, which I fully support.
You have to ensure that they have a place to arrive safely and to disperse from school safely, and that you give them an opportunity to distance themselves during the day for gym and recreation, because you know these are terrible times, The, kids and what you have here and as a parent of two children that go to Ps59 or one that recently graduated is a situation when you have very small sidewalks You have to keep in mind too that when the city did the deal with the developer to develop a high- rise building on the avenue, they only have so many open spaces that are rooftop open.
You know the number those numbers may be different now, but it should be a city- wide directive that you do whatever you can during these times to open these streets for these children, because you know we have no higher calling than to do this for them at this.
We're all aware that you know the opening of schools is a separate question which my committee will take up at its next meeting.
The, open street application- Moving on to the fourth agenda item here, a discussion on a possible resolution regarding the blockage of city streets by the New York City, Police, Department, I'm, not sure if folks have noticed, but the 13th and 17th precinct has put up barricades on 21st street and 51st street and not allowing folks to pass through unless they live on the block or are visiting a business on the block and the board office actually sent a letter back in July to Commissioner shea and did not get a response on this.
If we do put out, if we do consider a result on this, it should be a reso that says that we want these streets back open to the public, because we do not see anything happening right.
So I'd like to call the question in a reso that just asked the NYPD to open these streets again for the community.
I was going to second Sandy's call to question Let's vote on creating the resolution, hello, I will call your name, and you may answer in favor against abstain or not entitled when your name is called Claire Brennan in favor.
You all have to excuse me first time doing this, but now we are going to continue our discussion of the resolution that requested that DOT assess converting some commercial metered parking spaces to general metered parking in community district.
You you'll note that just one thing I'll note is that you know this is very much in context with a resolution that we had passed just five months, ago, sort of asking for a broader look at how herbs curbsides are used.
I am very concerned about the DOT being stretched as far as resources go, especially since, at this moment they're being asked to prioritize the open streets and other immediate projects.
Larry raises an interesting point there, because we really are stretched with what we can do and again with the resources that we have right now, because we're prioritizing we're trying to prioritize a lot of the safety projects that we have presented to the community boards, and there have been some cutbacks that you know we have to deal with.
I. Do not think this is going to be a priority for us at the moment, but not to say the least, that the community board should not put this in writing and send a resolution to DOT asking us to take a look at this.
I do not know, and if you want you're muted in Actually totally my bad, because the reso should say assess in Midtown East, not in community district.
I just want to point out that there's also a playground there at like where that exit is off 53rd street.
We want the DOT to look at So we'd like to put it into a resolution and that's a great idea.
And again our I know, our bike team is working on a you know, permanent solution that they can share with the Community board and when we do have something Togeth put together, And I'll ask them what the timeline is with that Then we're looking about the status of the 38th and 39th street Protected bike lanes that we're going in implementation is scheduled in September that that's actually going in real.
What I know for sure is that open street It's a temporary program that we've put together because of the Covid-19.
This problem, I think, actually was created the last time that street was paved and it just.
One of my fears is that we're going to have a car accident or something's going to happen with the city bus, because you know the streets colleen.
Is there some way or could we put up a resolution to help that tries to standardize or asks for DOT to maybe think of creative solutions to improve the safety, or at least the standardization of the outdoor dining?
Restaurant owners actually have come up with a pretty good solution, which is to park car in front of any of the open, dining areas that they can not.
