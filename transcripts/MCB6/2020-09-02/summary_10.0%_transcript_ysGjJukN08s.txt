We will field questions from the public So if someone from either committee is willing to volunteer to take these minutes, please raise your hand through zoom You can get it over with the first meeting of the year I'm new to cb, but also new to the committee What happens is that the board office will send you the minutes or not the minutes, but send you the minutes template the usually the day after the meeting, okay and not verbatim, you know more general notes for folks who are interested in what happens.
I always thought this would be a great promenade for the community and a way of building a continuous promenade around Manhattan island You use the 48th street ramp to the fdi drive on northbound It comes in the left lane, which is a problem unto itself, and you have a blind, merge.
Long and next is just the helix bridge in singapore but I thought at this point I'm happy to answer any questions you may have and So we will take questions from committee members I, just I have to just say, like as a first matter of business, for us to recommend a spend right to the city of like 100 to 200 million dollars.
Whoever is ready, will get the money and I think that new york should prepare itself should always be preparing itself for whenever that comes up, but right now, big money is not needed for this project right, sam sure, and if I can answer one other thing long island city is huge development going on I , don't see the city or the state having to pay for this entirely So, I, think for financing infrastructure and I've been involved in building a lot of infrastructure around the city , It's important to think of all the funding sources and not feel like this is a hopeless moment, and we cannot think big and I wholeheartedly support the 48th street location Greenway.
You know in east midtown, I, honestly, if it comes and I'd be happy to have a rezo I'd be happy to support a reso in advance like the best time for planning is in the you know like in the darkest days, but honestly if it was, if this was an item on a capital budget We have money and it's a lot harder to get the developers to pay for that, and the un certainly isn't going to so you know I, guess I'm happy to support it, but just not if it, if there's kind of any chance of it being at the expense literally of the greenway.
This is a show proposal and, as you hear today, people will offer many other solutions, but I think I would support a resolution for the concept and think it's important for new york city and its future bring up a good point about shovel, ready and I was really disappointed, not in the obama administration, but in how new york city was not ready and a lot of the shovel ready that we did spend was just repaving streets that were in pretty good condition.
There's a question from a member of the public, Mr steve, oh, wants to know what the touchdown on the roosevelt island section of the bridge would be what it would look like , That's how people got connected to roosevelt island from the queensborough bridge.
the resolve clause was stated as a resolution in support of this general plan, But, basically, I was going to suggest something in the resolve to suggest the 26 to 30 feet, width of the of the bridge and I guess we could acknowledge in the, whereas this is just a suggestion that we can acknowledge that the sticker there is a sticker price on it, but that, even if we would prioritize other infrastructure in the neighborhood that we that we assume over a long time frame that planning and construction dollars become available at some point that we could plan ahead to get and we could also bring in diverse sources of funding I would support the concept with the understanding that a lot of this has to be worked out.
What we want to do is get out there and say this is something that can be done and should be done and how it can be done is the province of new york, city's dot and the other city agencies, the construction anything in the bridge other than just to suggest a central span width, because I think that that's an important property of the bridge It massively impacts how it's used functionally, and it speaks to many issues that we've had in slightly narrower bridges and pathways in the region where the state and the city have been extremely short-sighted and given, basically, the width of a single traffic lane to a multi-use path for bikers and pedestrians, and then decided to punish the bicyclists when the very predictable conflicts happen If we're having open discussion, If people would like to help me write the resolution I'm all for that brian I can certainly work with you, but we need to vote.
What a treat okay, so agenda item number two again, thank you to the health and education committee for joining us We're, going to be discussing a possible resolution regarding school play streets in our district, including a specific proposal for east 56th street between second and third avenue, I'm, not sure john You want to take this agenda.
But this time with the added incentive of you know the restrictions of Covid-19, the desirability of having kids not on top of each other as they try to enter the school building and all of the other issues that you know are now plus The fact that 56th street, thanks to the residency of our president, is now blocked between fifth avenue at fifth avenue.
You know like you know, every time a school wants to create a play street and shut down a street you know are or we are we thinking about this numbers of Covid-19?.
You know: parent leadership, they're, gonna , I, think hi, claire cb6 member matt bondy helped draft this resolution and interrupted us So. A restaurant can close traffic lanes with near immediate approval, but schools have to wait months for approval when children are at risk and need space to exercise and arrive and disburse safely from school Why were businesses given expedited access to open streets and schools are having to wait.
I. Think, though, that you have to prioritize the children, and just like you have to get the restaurants back up and in business, which I fully support, We have an obligation to support our children and to get them back into school in a safer way, as we possibly can Coming from the mayor that you have to take your real, you know close look at how it might affect traffic patterns.
You have to ensure that they have a place to arrive safely and to disperse from school safely and that you give them an opportunity to distance themselves during the day for gym and recreation, because you know these are terrible times and the kids and what you have here and as a parent of two children that go to ps59 or one that recently graduated is a situation when you have very small sidewalks You really have to keep that in mind, and you have to keep in mind too that when the city did the deal with the developer to develop a high-rise building on the avenue, they only have so many open spaces that are rooftop open spaces In order to get to those spaces, you need to take the stairs You can't get into the school elevators and properly socially distance yourselves These kids are going to be expected to walk seven flights of stairs or, however many they might be You know, depending on what floor they're already on to get out to a place to play, and we have this opportunity on 56th street having grown up and lived on.
I think what the resolution says is that you have 2 000 kids that arrive every day and with you know, you know the number those numbers may be different now, but it should be a city-wide directive that you do whatever you can during these times to open these streets for these children, because you know we have no higher calling than to do this for them at this time.
Moving on to the fourth agenda item here, a discussion on a possible resolution regarding the blockage of city streets by the new york city, police department, I'm, not sure, if folks have noticed, but the 13th and 17th precinct has put up barricades on 21st street and 51st street and not allowing folks to pass through unless they live on the block or are visiting a business on the block and the board office actually sent a letter back in july to commissioner shea and did not get a response on this This discussion is not intended to be an open discussion about policing in the city.
It's we'll see what happens after labor day, but business You know, traffic is up and people are driving because they don't want to take the subway He mentioned that the general assembly is taking place in a few weeks and they think that our president may attend That's, not what he's thinking the president may actually come to for an address.
So I'd like to call the question in a reso that just asked the NYPD to open these streets again for the community.
Yes I am very concerned about the DOT being stretched as far as resources go, especially since, at this moment they're being asked to prioritize the open streets and other immediate projects, I think I think the fact that we voted in favor of a you, know, 200 million dollar bridge Larry, raises an interesting point there, because we really are stretched with what we can do and again with the resources that we have right now, because we're prioritizing we're trying to prioritize a lot of the safety projects that we have presented to the community boards, and there have been some cutbacks that you know we have to deal with.
I. Don't think this is going to be a priority for us at the moment, but not to say the least, that the community board should not put this in writing and send a resolution to DOT asking us to take a look at this.
but I think that was in favor ronnie white So we were asking about the city bike station at east, 15th and third avenue Thank you and then the temporary bike lane on 2nd avenue we've witnessed members of our board, has seen it You know the barrels on the sidewalk citizens have kind of taken action and fixed the lane themselves.
and again our I know, our bike team is working on a you know, permanent solution that they can share with the community board and when we do have something togeth put together and I'll, ask them what the timeline is with that and then we're looking about the status of the 38th and 39th street So I would imagine, sometime in september, I think we sent out the what's happening: here: flyer to the community board brendan sandy.
What I know for sure is that open street We have a few questions from our committee members, so larry Yes, first colleen , this is old business 14th street l, train restoration, The project is pretty much wrapped up except right.
Was this pretty serious one on second avenue in the 90s right, If I recall there was a collision and a car actually went through the wood that restaurant had used and went right through, like I, think multiple restaurants, So I'm, not I'm, not suggesting that you know we should get rid of our outdoor dining You Is there some way or could we put up a resolution to help that tries to standardize or asks for DOT to maybe think of creative solutions to improve the safety, or at least the standardization of the outdoor, dining?
