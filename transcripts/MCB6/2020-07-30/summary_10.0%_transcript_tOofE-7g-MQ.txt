Everybody welcome to the July 2020 business affairs and street activities committee meeting for Manhattan community board six.
Had my office put out a report on monday that was focused on some very actionable items that the city could take at this very moment to help some of the small businesses and our neighborhood businesses, and whichever is your favorite one.
They still have to do a lot of work and we have seen- And I think there are some really good and important issues at the federal level at the state, level.
That, we think are actionable, need attention and try to highlight them and also try to point the direction in for the city council members and for state legislatures or some of the items that their businesses and those who represent them are asking for and in the council.
The federal government will step in and do another version or extend the terms of the ppp program, which I think was actually pretty powerful and helpful to these small businesses.
You can open it up and make it public in a for the restaurants and for people to have walking space and things like that.
A really important one The just I'll just we'll send you the report around as well, but this is a good time for us all to be thinking about strategies to help them to give them a few more months of revenue at times where it's going to be really hard.
We did a small business petition to support outdoor dining, so we're trying to take some steps in the days ahead to actually lean into some of the ideas around it, and we are looking for ideas because we're always looking for more good ideas, but how to help these folks.
Just want to make sure that our especially our neighborhood, like restaurants and small businesses, know that we are trying to help them.
Where people you know, had supply or had access and were hiking those items up, And I think the price gouging law that was put in effect around clovid was predominantly focused on that stuff.
I also would be interested in looking at some furthering of the price gauging laws here in the city, particularly around state of emergencies, and maybe looking for ways to either actually solidify, though the things that, like better having to have to pass an executive order on that actually putting that into our law Just mention that you know some years ago when, when surge pricing started on uber, which is one of the third-party apps too, I, found that actually, there were a number instances when I remember it was a super bowl, night.
You know weather when it's a bad weather and other things and have been really kind of doing a lot to feed us and to get us the food, So You know I'm helping the people that are actually delivering it.
The mayor's office is the council kind of behind it, and it's really about getting the mayor's office on board and are there local organizations that you think would be valuable for those on the committee who have connected to mobilize The numbers are right in terms of the undocumented population.
Don't make us shut down our kitchen in the middle of the day, so that we are losing all that business for a half an hour an hour, But I would say, like look all voices really help here, because what I've learned in the pandemic and outdoor dining was a big part of it.
I've talked to the commissioner moya in the city about maybe trying to drive some like donors to this, because it's a private thing, But, but the book, the mayor's gonna, be the biggest impediment here, because he's gonna be do the right thing, which is to worry about the cost of it, but also I, found that we just need a lot of pushing from the council and outside people to get him to do the things we want them to do on almost any issue.
And I think the insurance companies industry is just at least the minimum saying give us the money to But I you know, I'm, not sure I would be more than willing to work with anybody who wants to do some lobbying around it.
Desanitation, whether it's pickup or street cleanings, or things like that The pandemic would solve at least one problem which is rats in new york city, as they had lost lots of options of food here.
I wanted to let you know how wonderful I think it is to see the restaurants coming back to life and how beautiful some of the streets look with the string lights and the tents and the way that they've done it up with planters and everything else.
We, go in support of the small business and outdoor dining program, including the recommendations in keith's reports all right, before.
We could just say that you know we want to maintain pedestrian safety and space as well as sanitation standards and public health standards, and something like that: okay, good, because they do Are the the potential likelihood that there are going to be a lot of schools coming for open streets as well for a recess and socially distanced drop off and pick up?
Don't think that as much as I you know, support small business, and everybody knows that I do that there should ever come a time when the interests of outdoor dining trump, the interests of socially distancing, kids and giving them a place to play.
Any other comments on this, because I you know, I, think matt brings up a great point, which is obviously we want to make sure that we're supporting the small businesses, but as we as the work is always included.
At the same time and the hard part about our decision making is You know, we have to often threat that line of supporting small business but at the same time supporting community safety and health, and All that Second, all right, kyle, your vote, yep, I'm in favor of supporting council member powers, economic plan, okay, matt in favor genie, favor paige, I'm in favor, john in favor, anton favor kevin in favor, seema.
You know we can call in the state, senator's office and the assembly member's office to see if someone can walk us through what their thinking is, where it is in the process as well.
Like a movement, so I think if people are, you know, we lost.
I think that would actually engage local people as well like there might be community members on their block, who would say hey for the business.
I think there needs to be some owners on the businesses themselves as to how they're you know, collecting trash and when they're putting it outside and how long they're, leaving it outside for, but that's again open to discussion, so You know sanitation, measures, but right, now, I'm, just thinking about immediate things, because I've received a lot of complaints about it.
Far as the city is concerned, it's a budget problem You know I've seen, people are using these corner garbage cans, but if they're not being emptied in a timely manner, well, they just get piled up and piled up.
You know there are smarter people in the sanitation department or in this business, who probably can come up with ideas.
Oh, I was gonna say that the this board has passed a resolution in support of the commercial waste zones program that the sanitation department you know is scheduled to do.
And you know, might allow for the things that he just described perfect and was that the land use committee, ah transportation, because or I don't recall- I was just going to point out that I believe we're getting a sanitation garage on 25th First, that there might be some opportunities there to experiment with some initiatives: It might offer us an opportunity to work with them since they're.
That's to me, sort of like the wish list, bigger idea for for the rest of new york city, As many people know.
Of course you know we should be thinking about budget requests going forward.
It's, primarily been on affordable research, space and inc business incubators for the district, which is you, know, has worked in some cases hasn't, but I really think this is time for us to be more substantial in what requesting, because, as we've seen from our workload, a lot of the you know.
So I wanted to open it up to, and this is obviously the first of many conversations, but I do want us to start thinking about it, because the budget committee is going to be discussing this as well.
And, of course, that's going to be very comprehensive going forward because there are a lot of needs going on right, now, but I wanted to open up the discussion to see what kind of things that people are thinking, about, things that we want to see in the district or maybe changes to agencies, priorities or anything else.
If you want to start off the conversation Thanks kyle, I was thinking of a small allocation to maybe work with the bids on a needs.
Obviously, I think this is exacerbated going forward, but I've always been interested in, like workforce readiness, making sure that people are prepared for the workforce that businesses are prepared for you know whatever it is, that's coming their way.
So really, as I was thinking about, you know, future budget requests and, of course this is not a fully formed idea, but really thinking about like entrepreneurs support so like really supporting small businesses.
But or if people as they've, you know been preparing for this meeting, have come up with other ideas or just have a gut reaction in this moment to some things that we could put on this budget list.
This may seem, I, don't know, sort of minor or maybe obvious, but I think a lot of small businesses- This gets at some of the issues that have come in front of this committee have struggled with just the basic cost of PPE and other things.
You know: I, don't want people to think that an idea is too small or too big.
And, then you know we can get more information about what specifically that looks like because then the budget committee then puts the district needs together, and all of that Like you know again, the city is going through transition and obviously our local neighborhoods is our as well, And I think you know a lot of conversations when it comes to reform, or you know, big changes that we need to see often start at the budget, level, and So even I think another way to think about these budget requests too Does it put the issue on notice?
We are the only committee right now , I think that's meeting through the summer, and obviously the issues that we are facing right now and discussing are very important to not only our neighborhood but through the city as a whole, not just for now, but for years to come.
