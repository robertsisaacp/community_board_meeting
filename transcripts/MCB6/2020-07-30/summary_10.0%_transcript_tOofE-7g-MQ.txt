I want to thank you and your office for joining us today, and we look forward to the information you're about to share with us everybody's, safe and healthy and doing well even still during a pandemic in a quite a difficult time here in the city and thank you guys for all you're doing to stay connected and keep helping our community at a time where it's so necessary and we just need to kind of continue to be able to see each other talk to each other and work on some of these important challenges before the city We, had my office put out a report on monday that was focused on some very actionable items that the city could take at this very moment to help some of the small businesses and our neighborhood businesses, and whichever is your favorite one, It's, probably having a very difficult time, whether it's your favorite, restaurant or retail or local store, Some are still shut down and capacity limits are not making money the way that they expected to or are used to, but the rents are still due and I.
We are still going to need to step in as a city and provide or and likely provide some business assistance either to businesses that can't get ppp, some that still might need it or some that are going to need some other version of assistance beyond that What I am saying is in whatever version of aid we get indirectly someone's gonna have to go to a plug holes in our social safety net in our budget, but we have to set aside some portion of money to be able to put out together a program to help either do grants low interest loans, maybe convertible to grants or some version of both to make sure we can help these businesses get through the next few months, even if you're, just a restaurant you're doing outdoor dining.
We did a small business petition to support outdoor dining, so we're trying to take some steps in the days ahead to actually lean into some of the ideas around it, and we are looking for ideas because we're always looking for more good ideas, but how to help these folks What would be really sad for me is that we don't have the opportunity to visit our favorite establishments because of Covid-19 and our unwillingness or inability to identify and find those items that we can help them with We are trying to give them ways out and I.
I also would be interested in looking at some furthering of the price, gauging laws here in the city, particularly around state of emergencies, and maybe looking for ways to either actually solidify, though the things that, like better having to have to pass an executive order on that actually putting that into our law Just mention that you know some years ago when, when surge pricing started on uber, which is one of the third-party apps too The hike and I actually, with the attorney general's office, went through the price guiding law and found that was price guiding because of a weather event with limited supply, and we actually did get them to actually define it.
Here They are essential to our economy and we're leaving them out of our financial assistance right now, but you know we shouldn't have to provide for like we're relying private philanthropy to fill in a gap That's this important I , don't think any of the financial assistance that people got is probably enough at this moment in time, but It's been good, but you know, as I saw as we get deeper.
I've talked to the commissioner moya in the city about maybe trying to drive some like donors to this, because it's a private thing, but but the book, the mayor's gonna, be the biggest impediment here, because he's gonna be do the right thing, which is to worry about the cost of it, but also I found that we just need a lot of pushing from the council and outside people to get him to do the things we want them to do on almost any issue: Thank you we'll move on to jeannie and just a reminder to members of the public Is the business interrupted, insurance?.
When do you think something like this, because this will be a tremendous relief act and this will come from the private sector rather than public sector Think it's important , there's so much money in the insurance industry that they hold There was an old bill by bobby carroll's assembly, member of Brooklyn The state senator that required it retroactively, which people really freaked out about because of all these exists, there's contractual issues and things like that You have to start allowing it, which also would limit the scope of money but would still help these guys out.
Outdoor dining has had a lot of positive change, but there has also been some negative effects of people dining outside, most notably the sanitation and There been, as we you know, look to extend outdoor dining?, You, know desanitation, whether it's pickup or street cleanings, or things like that The pandemic would solve at least one problem, which is rats in new york city, as they had lost lots of options of food here, but we didn't get that One is just street cleaning and making sure that we have ways to do street cleaning Two We, you have utilities that still need to get through to the sidewalk that are not able to do their work right now.
If we're gonna extend, we have to do an actual conversation about how to keep it for the long term, I think they had applications open on friday by monday , people were open, so there was purposely not a lot of thought put on it, because we wanted to get these guys open and put money into their pockets.
There is a conversation that needs to be had about that I wanted to let you know how wonderful I think it is to see the restaurants coming back to life and how beautiful some of the streets look with the string lights and the tents and the way that they've done it up with planters and everything else It troubled me that I was directed into the street with my family so that I wouldn't walk down the corridor on the sidewalk and I.
If we have issues with you, know- sanitation of course, or even ideas on as the council member just mentioned, You know opportunities for street cleaning and making sure that there is an evaluation that doesn't disrupt with you, know: pedestrian space or traffic I like to think that restaurants can do the same, especially if we're supplying so much support of them.
Yeah, we don't have to you, know, put forth a specific plan within this resolution on any of that , we could just say that you know we want to maintain pedestrian safety and space as well as sanitation standards and public health standards and something like that, okay good, because they do Are the the potential likelihood that there are going to be a lot of schools coming for open streets as well for a recess and socially distanced drop off and pick up?
Don't think that as much as I, you know support small business and everybody knows that I do that there should ever come a time when the interests of outdoor dining trump, the interests of socially distancing, kids and giving them a place to play So if it were, if there were there, should never be that collision between the two that students should always you know, take precedence and the prospect of open streets for play.
When, the you know: quarantine stayed home guidelines first started, which of course affected many businesses and a lot of them didn't have insurance I covered, or at least business interruption that covered pandemics, and so what this legislation does in partnership with the state senate bill As the council member mentioned that it should be part of business interruption going forward so that businesses can have a layer of protection against what's going on, So I, don't know if anyone got to review this before the meeting, but I want to open it up for discussion Obviously.
This is an important piece of legislation that we should, you know, send our support to or if we have changes to it, that we should indicate those as well all right , I see it's hard to read this document You know we can call in the state senator's office and the assembly member's office to see if someone can walk us through what their thinking is, where it is in the process as well If. That is something that the committee would prefer.
I think that would actually engage local people as well like there might be community members on their block, who would say hey for the business Take it to the to the compost thing you don't have to do it I'll do it which could reduce the amount of trash I , don't know exactly why I think trash has just always been an issue.
I think there needs to be some owners on the businesses themselves as to how they're you know, collecting trash and when they're putting it outside and how long they're leaving it outside for, but that's again open to discussion You know any potential resolution there's two issues over here, one, the business garbage and the street garbage businesses have to use private carters where, as a city to picks up their garbage from the corners corner, garbage cans, there was a program on the news, the other night So, it's a money problem there, On the other hand, the commercial carters I think should be incented to go on the schedule such that garbage has not left 8 10 12 hours out on the street I've seen that in my neighborhood, which is around 56 first, there are some businesses that the garbage is out in an hour or two and other businesses where they just stay there and unfortunately, there's no single carter.
Oh I was gonna say that the this board has passed a resolution in support of the commercial waste zones program that the sanitation department you know, is scheduled to do Obviously that was pushed back because of the pandemic, but that will be happening sooner than later, and that would allow for what anton has just described if it's a zone- and you know, might allow for the things that he just described perfect and was that the land use committee, ah transportation because or I don't recall- I was just going to point out that I believe we're getting a sanitation garage on 25th and first that there might be some opportunities there to experiment with some initiatives: Are. You aware the brookdale project right, there's not been a lot of movement on the brookdale project in the last little while and I would be very interested to see how the city's budgetary constrictions impact.
This exists on roosevelt island, where they have tubes that actually suck the trash out and send it to a trash collection center Anyone has ever been to roosevelt island, you don't notice any trash outside or on the streets That's to me, sort of like the wish list, bigger idea for for the rest of new york city Yes, as many people know, there is conversations about the brookdale site, which has been obviously very contentious for for our community At. The same time from brendan who mentioned the resolution originated with the transportation committee, this about the commercial waste zone and the resolution passed back in 2018 If anyone would like to see what that resolution was about, the link is in the chat box as well.
Basa hasn't really had many budget requests, as you can see from here, It's primarily been on affordable research, space and inc business incubators for the district, which is you know, has worked in some cases hasn't, but I really think this is time for us to be more substantial in what requesting, because, as we've seen from our workload, a lot of the you know, future development and future ideas are landing on our laps as the business affairs committee and supporting small businesses, but also community development.
So, a community needs assessment, exactly okay, perfect and obviously I think this is exacerbated going forward, but I've always been interested in like workforce readiness, making sure that people are prepared for the workforce that businesses are prepared for you know whatever it is, that's coming their way, So really as I was thinking about.
You know creating some kind of like job network or hub for people, because obviously a lot of people have been unemployed, but maybe creating some kind of training program to get people back on their feet that helps them get trained in job placements or workforce readiness, something along those lines, Those lines, because I think this is an opportunity for us to come up with creative ideas to address the problems that we're seeing particularly from a business economic development side but or if people as they've you know been preparing for this meeting, have come up with other ideas or just have a gut reaction in this moment to some things that we could put on this budget list, any initial thoughts or ideas You do, please raise your hand, kyle yep, to genie's suggestion earlier, something like hiring a consultant to help to specifically help us get a better sense of the neighborhood, probably wouldn't make it on the budget request that we submit to the city, but is certainly something that we could You know the community board with our budget or with the street.
The funding for east midtown, restaurants in retail, This may seem I, don't know, sort of minor or maybe obvious, but I think a lot of small businesses, and this gets at some of the issues that have come in front of this committee have struggled with just the basic cost of PPE and other things know: minimum PPE fund, grant program, etc.
You know, I, don't want people to think that an idea is too small or too big But, that's a great point: If we're asking small businesses to abide by certain rules, we also have to make sure that they that this is in another incurred cost I mean you know just pulling off our previous conversation, something on sanitation We want an increase in the number of garbage cans or compost.
And then you know we can get more information about what specifically that looks like because then the budget committee then puts the district needs together and all of that Like you know again, the city is going through transition and obviously our local neighborhoods is our as well and I.
