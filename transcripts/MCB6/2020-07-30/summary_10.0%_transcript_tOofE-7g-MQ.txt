Everybody welcome to the July 2020 business affairs and Street Activities committee meeting for Manhattan Community board six.
Had my office put out a report on Monday that was focused on some very actionable items that the city could take at this very moment to help some of the small businesses and our neighborhood businesses, and whichever is your favorite one.
They still have to do a lot of work and we have seen- And I think there are some really good and important issues at the federal level at the state, level.
That, we think are actionable, need attention and try to highlight them and also try to point the direction in for the City Council members and for state legislatures or some of the items that their businesses and those who represent them are asking for and in the council.
The federal government will step in and do another version or extend the terms of the ppp program, which I think was actually pretty powerful and helpful to these small businesses.
If you're, just a restaurant, you're doing outdoor dining, you can't have indoor capacity when you do it's going to be still be 25 we're facing a long road ahead for a lot of these businesses.
Maybe I think we should start with businesses that found themselves ineligible for federal assistance and also businesses that are long likely going to be opening at a much later phase.
We introduced a bill into this into the city Council on Tuesday, with Margaret Chin and Gail Brewer, which attacks the commercial rent tax, which is you guys, probably know this?
You can open it up and make it public in a for the restaurants and for people to have walking space and things like that.
A really important one The just I'll just we'll send you the report around as well, but this is a good time for us all to be thinking about strategies to help them to give them a few more months of revenue at times where it's going to be really hard.
We did a small business petition to support outdoor dining, so we're trying to take some steps in the days ahead to actually lean into some of the ideas around it, and we are looking for ideas because we're always looking for more good ideas, but how to help these folks.
Just want to make sure that our especially our neighborhood, like restaurants and small businesses, know that we are trying to help them.
Where people you know, had supply or had access and were hiking those items up, And I think the price gouging law that was put in effect around Covid-19 was predominantly focused on that stuff.
I also would be interested in looking at some furthering of the price gauging laws here in the city, particularly around state of emergencies, and maybe looking for ways to either actually solidify, though the things that, like better having to have to pass an executive order on that actually putting that into our law When, when surge pricing started on Uber, which is one of the third- party, apps too, I found that actually there were a number instances when I remember it was a super bowl, night.
The mayor's office is the council kind of behind it, and it's really about getting the mayor's office on board and are there local organizations that you think would be valuable for those on the committee who have connected to mobilize The numbers are right in terms of the undocumented population.
This crisis, I think it's going to You know concerned about a people that can't access any of that That there's some way to help pay the rent and Albany I just do not get the sense of doing them, so I do try to be a little actionable here versus just waiting for you, know, hoping some other form of government will do.
I've talked to the Commissioner Moya in the city, about maybe trying to drive some like donors to this, because it's a private thing, But, but the book, the mayor's going to be the biggest impediment here, because he's going to be do the right thing, which is to worry about the cost of it, but also I, found that we just need a lot of pushing from the council and outside people to get him to do the things we want them to do on almost any issue.
I think this is something that local mobilization like this is something that's like a lobbying issue: So I'm, assuming the insurers, are in Albany right now and where else in this country, you know pushing back on this.
You know what New York City is doing as far as lobbying to get this legislation through and when do you think something like this, because this will be a tremendous relief act and this will come from the private sector rather than public, sector, and I.
I believe we passed it as part of our small one of our small business hearings, but I do not think there's no, And I think the insurance companies industry is just at least the minimum saying give us the money to But I you know, I'm, not sure I would be more than willing to work with anybody who wants to do some lobbying around it.
You know these other alternative chinese restaurants, for example, in your neighborhood, that you could utilize or go to instead, and this a couple of businesses have shared this with us, so I mean I had not heard that issue.
Actually, I was I'm doing a lot around independent music venues too, and trying to save them, and I talked to one owner who kind of has a couple bars and venues, and he said that, like one negotiated, one, they kind of came to some terms on how to pay and the others he's got to know.
You, know desanitation, whether it's pickup or street cleanings, or things like that The pandemic would solve at least one problem, which is rats in New York City, as they had lost lots of options of food here, but we did not get that One is just street cleaning and making sure that we have ways to do street cleaning.
I wanted to let you know how wonderful I think it is to see the restaurants coming back to life and how beautiful some of the streets look with the string lights and the tents and the way that they've done it up with planters and everything else.
We, go in support of the small business and outdoor dining program, including the recommendations in Keith's reports all right, before.
If we have issues with you, know: sanitation of course, or even ideas on as the council member, just mentioned.
You know sanitation, going through, and I lost my train of thought, the other on the other, oh about coming through pedestrian traffic, that they find that they should start looking for ways to organize pedestrian traffic for pedestrian flow without making a specific recommendation.
We could just say that you know we want to maintain pedestrian safety and space as well as sanitation standards and public health standards, and something like that: okay, good, because they do Because.
Any other comments on this, because I you know, I, think Matt brings up a great point, which is obviously we want to make sure that we're supporting the small businesses, but as we as the work is always included.
The mayor, shut that down Right, Emotion, like people need to know that again, sanitation is part of you, know, keeping a virus at Bay. Is it so much trash That's not our trash.
I think that would actually engage local people as well like there might be community members on their block, who would say hey for the business.
I. Think there needs to be some owners on the businesses themselves as to how they're you know, collecting trash and when they're putting it outside and how long they're, leaving it outside for, but that's again open to discussion, so I want you know any potential.
You know sanitation, measures, but right, now, I'm, just thinking about immediate things, because I've received a lot of complaints about it.
Far as the city is concerned, it's a budget problem You know I've seen, people are using these corner garbage cans, but if they're not being emptied in a timely manner, well, they just get piled up and piled up.
You know there are smarter people in the sanitation department or in this business, who probably can come up with ideas.
Oh, I was going to say that the this board has passed a resolution in support of the commercial waste zones program that the sanitation department you know is scheduled to do.
That's to me sort of like the wish list, bigger idea for for the rest of New York City, As many people know.
The commercial trash has increased because of you know more people going out And then there's also the what Anton mentioned, because there are, we do have budget cuts.
Of course you know we should be thinking about budget requests going forward.
Some cases has not, but I really think this is time for us to be more substantial in what requesting, because, as we've seen from our workload, a lot of the you know, future development and future ideas are landing on our laps as the Business Affairs Committee and supporting small businesses, but also community.
But I- do want us to start thinking about it, because the budget Committee is going to be discussing this as well.
If you want to start off the conversation, Kyle, I was thinking of a small allocation to maybe work with the bids on a needs.
Hmm, so a community needs assessment, exactly okay, perfect!, Obviously, I think this is exacerbated going forward, but I've always been interested in, like workforce readiness, making sure that people are prepared for the workforce that businesses are prepared for you know whatever it is, that's coming their way.
So really, as I was thinking about, you know, future budget requests and of course this is not a fully formed idea, but really thinking about like entrepreneurs support so like really supporting small businesses.
There's a definition at the state level, but the city really has not defined that, and so I think there needs to be some support for those actual small businesses that we're talking.
But or if people as they've, you know been preparing for this meeting, have come up with other ideas or just have a gut reaction in this moment to some things that we could put on this budget list.
Do not want people to think that an idea is too small or too big.
And, then you know we can get more information about what specifically that looks like because then the budget committee then puts the district needs together, and all of that The city is going through transition and obviously our local neighborhoods is our as well, And I think you know a lot of conversations when it comes to reform, or you know, big changes that we need to see often start at the budget, level, and So even I think another way to think about these budget requests too Does it put the issue on notice, you know : Does it put it on people's minds that this is something that we're thinking about?
You know complaints from people within the neighborhood who said that they had been seeing some stuff, so I just want to put that out.
Is there any other new or old business or any other comments that people would like to make all right.
We are the only committee right now , I think that's meeting through the summer, and obviously the issues that we are facing right now and discussing are very important to not only our neighborhood but through the city as a whole, not just for now, but for years to come.
