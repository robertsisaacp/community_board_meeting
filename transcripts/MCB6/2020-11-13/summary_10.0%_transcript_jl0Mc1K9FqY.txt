Let's get started, then all right so welcome everybody to the November 12 2020, full board meeting of Manhattan Community board six.
Obviously, right, now, everyone's focused on managing the recent uptick in and covered cases, but council member powers has also been looking ahead to make sure that we're preparing, for you know in particular what Midtown and the transportation system need to be ready for economic recovery, so Councilmember powers published an op-ed in cranes.
You know talking about how safe, reliable transportation is going to be a really key part of midtown's recovery, and he talked about a few different items that he thinks we should prioritize.
That includes more space for CitiBike stations, including working with developers to place CitiBike stations in you, know, pops and other locations using new development to increase accessibility in subways and further pedestrianizing streets in Midtown other than that.
They helped out with a great community cleanup in the skytown area, both on 14th street and in stycove park, and they also to a few weeks ago during early voting, helped keep some poll sites clean in those areas that we're seeing.
Past month the congresswoman fought and succeeded to get the administration to agree to pay back millions of dollars that it took from the fdny's 911 treatment program the census ended and though we will not know what happens in regards to accuracy and the time it takes to get the data for a little bit.
In light of the transition issues mentioned earlier, the congresswoman joins other House Committee chairs and sending dozens of letters directing the White, House and federal agencies to preserve documents in accordance with the law.
We have been getting some calls about the new homeless, shelter, opening up on East, 40Th, Street and Lexington avenue, and we wanted folks to know that our office has been in conversation with the department of Homeless services and the agency that will be running the shelter.
We are confident in the measures that they are taking and we will be in close touch with them, as the shelter opens up for residents most likely at the end of this year, and as always, we are still helping folks with unemployment, tenant resources and, amongst other things.
You know it's throughout the district, but focusing on specific areas that we've noticed are outside of bids that are already you know, getting extra street cleaning services or areas where we've gotten a lot of constituent complaints in the past few years, so they'll be focusing primarily on that they have five different folks in their cleaning crew who are going to specific areas.
We have not really been open, so there's been a whole lot to talk about, but I definitely wanted to stop in because it's kyle's, you know.
But I know that they are doing some sort of program, but I've mostly been like a 67th street guy at the moment.
In, our letter, the comptroller called on the agency to expedite capital projects that address chronic issues across New York, City's, 326, public housing, developments from poor ventilation and elevator outages to broken boilers and mold outbreaks that will become even more dangerous when colder weather keeps residents indoors.
He testified at a city council hearing a couple of years ago and as a result, the rent stabilization Association, the Landlord lobby, sued him for speaking out in support of rent stabilization for 40 million dollars.
That's going to bring New York up to the level of anti-slap lawsuits as other states like California.
Look for save our storefronts act, online, there's a coalition of small businesses that are joining behind us to try to get this bill passed and then finally, I want to tell you that I am participating.
So, obviously we're you know in terms of our of our office's work on the legislative.
A lot of other agencies are just in case discontinuing use of n95 masks and providing them to the hospital and Clinton network and using lower grade mass that are still safe, but that do not involve you know longer term exposure as hospital workers would.
We recently passed at the last stated meeting or sorry, not passed, introduce a bill to correct a wrong that we think has been on the books for way too long.
I. Think I actually had the pleasure on voting on the design at one point has been looking: at.
We can get this agreement over the hump and start work on that project, hopefully into next year and then finally, an update because I know CB6 works.
I'd urge them to seek it out, because her position on open streets and her vision for them is something that we shared when they first came out, and we complained that the mayor had chopped these things up into unusable bits rather than the sort of networking and freeing things that they could be for people living around the city to get around in the age of Covid-19.
So I just want to point that out to people and we're looking forward to working with you and her on, hopefully, updating and upgrading all those things in the near future.
Hi pedro I just wanted to alert, you, I'm, not 100 sure if this is still in your district, but when you mention phone booths we have been CB6 has been asking for quite some time now on the request of the 29Th Street Association about two particular phone booths, around 31st and Lexington.
We know if we, if the assembly members joining us or will Jackson, be delivering that report.
Six I've lived here for several years: I wanted to speak to you all about the restaurant meals program and the benefits that it can bring to our community, both for local businesses that are struggling right now, especially with rising cape towns and the potential, for you, know, indoor, dining disposals and the residents that call us our community home.
Think a program in New York state would also bring a lot of benefits, both in terms of increased revenue to restaurants and increased flexibility for people when it comes to using their snap, benefits, so I think it could bring.
The community board does not deal directly with you, know, promoting legislation, but I think it would mean a lot if the community board would show support for it through a letter to the state Senate or through some other kind of support for this issue.
So, much just clarify that, in fact, the board, often our resolutions, are in fact on support of specific legislation and encouraging that to get passed.
I would ask you know how to follow up with us on the business affairs, the basic committee, just because, like the point that was either mentioned.
So I, do want to mention that before beginning I also want to express my appreciation for the previous executive committee for their leadership over the past several years, and specifically I'd like to recognize molly hollister for her tenure as chair and all that she was able to accomplish.
Thank, you so much for your leadership as the chair for the past couple of years and lastly, I want to thank all of you for demonstrating your faith in the new Executive board.
In the next few months, we're going to be rolling out efforts to enhance remote partnership among board members to build a leadership pipeline and new ways of engaging the public in our processes and decision making, and it's my hope that you know we establish our community board as the think tank of our district, a place where ideas can interact where we can think outside of the box and where things that seemed impossible yesterday can finally begin to become a reality.
You know needed by our communities to address these issues some housekeeping, so my tenure obviously began last week and we've reorganized some of the committee leadership.
And I also want to take some time to thank Pam Vassell, who stepped down from that role for her service on this board and on this committee for the past several years with that Jeannie Dinofrio is now the vice chair of parks and Claire.
So I'd like to just congratulate everybody in their new leadership roles, and to thank you for all the work that you've done aboard before and really looking forward to moving forward with all this energy to address these issues in our neighborhoods.
Let the board know that the comptroller's office will be conducting an audit of all Manhattan community boards, compliance with the city charter and with New York City Administrative code requirements for meetings, public hearings and websites.
One of the things the comptroller's office will be looking at is whether each community board takes minutes at their meeting and post them on their website in timely manner, as you've heard.
Of course, board five is looked at a little bit, which is this issue that I keep talking about, which is the public realm or public space are.
I. Think community boards are really the place to try to work on that, because it is even today so complicated.
Thank you because you know a lot of people talk about affordable, housing.
There are a lot of veterans, for instance, as you know, that work in Defender world and other places where they oh feels they have not been responsible, but that's a good idea on November 23rd in our office, working with HPD.
We all have to work because I spent a great deal of time working with the board of elections and a lot of people say no I will not have elections in my building, and so maybe there's something else that we can come up.
There's a hearing on all of these issues on December 9th at 5:30, sponsored by the New York City campaign, Finance board I, do want to thank molly and all of you and your work on waterfront, issues.
York does have some which I've been trying to stop in terms of tourism helicopters, but it seems like New. Jersey is the culprit, so we have been talking to the elected officials there trying to get them to understand that flying over Manhattan as a tourist is not a good idea, but I can't say: we've been successful, but just so you know we're very focused on it.
I know, we've all been working on the cleanups and all of those issues because of the cut to the sanitation.
Guys, Susan hi, just two things: one is: there was a homeless encampment on 15th street between first and this little half street, going towards second, and to my surprise, it was the police department that cleaned that came and cleaned all the junk.
I was going to say that the 15th street encampment I think that's commanding officer Hellman the 13th precinct they're exceptional and they will say, and in some in some areas, and they will say that they'll work with the sanitation, they'll work with the DHS and the breaking ground.
A couple of other things that have been going on in the district as people know, there's been a lot of conversations around the roles of the police and there's been in the southern part of the my district, but not.
Just because of you know the chocolate they used against Donnie Wright and the over aggressive policing, where we're going to have to figure out a plan to deal with this in a comprehensive way and really thinking about what policing should look like in this city in this state and luckily, as we move into a new calendar year as we move into a new budget cycle, a new legislative session there'll be a lot of opportunities to work through those issues.
In, the end, after five years of moving forward to that plan, he got to 14, so New, York, City and New York state does not really have any markers or any sense of how we're doing with hiring with people with disabilities and 30 years after the ADA.
We had a hearing this morning around judiciary, because they're now not reappointing almost 50 judges in New, York state, which means tens of thousands of cases, are not going to get heard.
We need to figure out how we're going to win this fight with the governor, because they can't just go to the general fund and they can't just go like medical Marijuana.
We want to make sure that the kid on the street corner, who might be selling weed right now, can have a legitimate business and get into the from the gray market to the legal market and the way the governor's proposing.
But I, believe the very first reso I passed as the housing and homeless Human rights committee, together with the when I became chair, was a resolution that passed in support of the legalization of Marijuana and in particular this Krueger's bill.
Thank, you so very much for having me good to see assembly, member epstein and hoping that he can work with our state Senator Liz Krueger to legalize and make it.
If you happen to hear my two and a half year old, she recently came up with some new excuses for why she can't sleep so I may have to run I just want to thank everyone for voting.
This is after I worked with gail Brewer to bring it out there, and a lot of folks are talking about what the new normal is going to look.
I do not know very many people were like.
New, York City is the only place where, if you, if you, if everything does not work out for you in life, you're, more likely than not to get forced out of the city, we need to change.
Last year, you just got a two million dollar cut, so we're having a hearing in my committee on contracts on November 25th at 10 A.M the day before thanksgiving and we're hoping that we can convince the grinch of a mayor to restore funding to our nonprofits in time for Thanksgiving and the Christmas and Holiday season.
And I want to thank Sandy and molly, obviously too, for the leadership they provided for this committee over the years.
One of the things we're very concerned with is redesigning open space in the streets in New York, especially in our district, and that's a that's, a vision that we're going to be pursuing in any number of ways.
There seems to be no evidence of erosion in any other area, so they're going to repair that sinkhole and then return things to normal, because right now you know, Waterside has no bus service, just for example, because buses can't run through there.
I'm, not sure who did this, but whoever set up the the barrels and the barricades at the exit for 34Th street did a really good job by making them really tight and curving them enough, so that cars can't speed past about 30 miles an hour at best, and most of them are going way slower than that they put up, stop signs at the north end of the parking lot.
You have to think, because this is just the beginning of things that we want to do in terms of rearranging how the streets work we're going to we've seen during Covid-19 cars went down, bike, use, went way up everyone's seen.
The committee's, been working really hard on putting together a website and updating things and getting ready to launch it and then put together a timeline for community Outreach and engagement around that, and we also have been really discussing how 197a working group should be really closely connected to the other committees, particularly land use, housing, homeless, transportation, all of them in some way or other, because we think there's opportunities in that 197A to kind of achieve some of the things we're looking to do, whether it's you know trying to prioritize, affordable housing or other things, community, centered things we want to do in our neighborhood.
Come up and present a resolution that they're working on that they had worked on in past to establish a permanent exhibit in the northeast section of central park to honor social justice reform and the exoneration of the Central Park, five, which I'm sure most of us have heard, are familiar with the five black and latino children who were wrongfully convicted and prosecuted in 1989 for the very brutal rape, a white man who was jogging at Central, Park and they're, proposing a permanent piece there to serve as a to reflect on like the human cost of racism and demonstrating that this is an isolated incidence of injustice, but really a systematic problem.
As of now, they've been going around and doing presentations to the community boards, the Central Park Conservancy, the New York City, Parks Office of the mayor office, the Manhattan border president and kind of getting everybody's buy-in.
Are there any questions on this resolution, members off the board, all right.
I know that the office of Manhattan borough president was very much in support of the resolution, so they were also on the call to present it and reiterate their support.
I mean it's good to know that the Manhattan border president's office was on that culture and supportive of it.
I know if corrine or kyle, if you, if you could recall, but they are working with numerous stakeholders, both like on a city level like the residents themselves, as well as like what I've seen before the New York City, Parks, offices, mayor.
This was simply a presentation from CB10 to see if they could corral the support of other community boards in an effort to do something to commemorate so this is even before we get into questions like that.
Our support is to do something that would show the symbolism of what happened to the city and the country on this whole thing, also, at the same time that you're dealing with the issues of racism, now.
Our committee is meeting to hear from department of Homeless services and core services group about a new permanent adult family, shelter at 118, East, 40Th, Street.
And I'll second, that motion, but I also just want to say thanks to the Parks Committee.
Please go back to the ballots and mark your vote on the digital ballot for this resolution and do not hit Submit, and while people are taking time to do that, Kevin, do you have a committee report, a brief, one.
So we're going to do our part as a committee and as a board to kind of keep the community abreast with that said.
I want to thank the board office for all their help.
Yes, that's a very important issue and the borough president will hear a greater consensus in so far as what we need and the other community boards.
And I want to congratulate the new community chairs.
You know we're talking about a green new deal, and.
That's a service issue that could go to the board office and if you give them the particular streets, they can find out whether there's a problem or not.
