We shouldn't have side discussions in the chat room, especially since members of the public can not or because members of the public do not have access to that chat should only be used to alert us to a technical difficulty you're having or to state an information writing such as an email address that was stated aloud on the record during the meeting when the committee member is given the floor to speak, I'll identify you and you can unmute yourself so that you can speak.
And I know from emails that we've received that we have members of the public who are very interested in weighing in on this and commenting on this, but to bring a little bit of expertise to tonight's meeting.
Once again, I'm, going to remind people who I something I already said, don't attack landlo as an advocate who is as opposed and concerned about many of the things that are going on right now in our schools.
I'm, going to broaden it a little from the agenda right, now, And I should say more concern to New York City, public school parents, and the first obviously, is that for those of you who don't know, New York City public schools are currently closed.
The first issue that is confronting parents is this uncertainty about when schools are going to reopen.
Please interrupt me if I'm giving any inaccurate information, but, As some of you may have heard, there was an agreement with the UFT and the city of New York, whereby if the positive test results went above I think it's three percent, you would have schools closed.
That sounds like it's a very reasonable agreement, but the most recent testing numbers that I'm aware of show a point or 0.22 positivity rate inside the New York City schools, I asked Deputy Chancellor Austin Adrian Austin at the last Cpac meeting last week.
I mean potentially tens of thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands that are very upset about this, and this decision to close schools is coming on top of a decision by the mayor to restrict the time period in which parents have the option of choosing blended or fully remote learning.
Are there 60,000, New York City school students that have no access to any type of device that will allow them to receive any type of educational, instruction, And they're, trying to address that right, now.
There is a feeling that remote instruction is not working, certainly not a substitute for live instruction, So we've had a lot of parents in in our district that are that really want to see more in live, more live, in-person, school instruction and I and by the way, every any view that I express.
For those of you who don't know public school parents have to make decisions, starting in fourth grade, where you, where your child, if your child is going through a k through five school, where your child is going to go to middle school, so the way that those admissions have been done in the past is you look at fourth grade.
What's going to happen, So you have a lot of schools that are looking at the possibility of not having a class next year.
Now, for those of you who are conspiracy, buffs and I'm sure we don't have any of you on Community board six, There are those people, certainly in our district, who feel that the mayor and the chancellor are in fact using this or using Covid-19 as cover to kind of tweak their admissions enrollments and to change the process of gifted and talented and to push back on the specialized high school admissions test all to promote equity, which is certainly something that's very important, and you hear a lot about.
When things settle down, It will be an issue for this committee or that our parents in our district will be interested in.
And I have the opportunity, as a member of Cpac, to hear from districts all around the city, but there's the frustration of not knowing when schools are going to reopen.
Let me use the the hand raised function for members of the members of the committee with any questions or comments they might want to make, and you can also just make a comment to Len. And, then we'll open it up.
And I know it from having a third grader that you need somebody to actually sit there and put somebody on make sure they're actually doing what they're supposed to do, which requires timing and people are at home.
You know who are looking at, maybe graduating you know and lacking basic fundamental education, and it's really problematic to my second question: How do someone like you, put pressure on the Board of Ed. To answer your second part of your question, I haven't heard so, for example, I know.
Excuse me some of the technical support issues, so I haven't heard about not having access to laptops, while the schools are close, so the school's really and also there are first responders children through certain programs that are actually receiving some I understand.
These are we're showing very small percentages of New York City school students, but it is the way that what we can do as a community.
But again those are going to take time to work their way through the system and they're not going to bring about the critical change that we need right now, but as a community we need to mobilize, We need to demand answers and say: look.
People may not be symptomatic and they're only testing, random numbers of people, it's possible, The numbers and schools are even higher, But. The interesting thing is I read a statistic that 26 of New York City Department of education employees have medical waivers now.
So you're never going to get the city restored to the way it's it needs to be fully functional when the educational system isn't working.
Maybe it might be worth our committee's time to think of a response to that and say like or add to it, because if people are coming up with ideas, we should be able to come up with a response or better ideas.
Okay, sorry again, but it's just building on the point that Len just made, which is an excellent one, and obviously something that we've discussed very extensively, is about being proactive on a lot of these issues and really taking the stand and making sure that we're putting out what we want as a committee and as a board and as a community and leading that charge in terms of you, know, dictating the conversation and really shaping it around the needs that we have so John.
But what I would like to if someone were to make a resolution that the committee at that this committee, at the December full board, meeting, have drafted a resolution in relation to the crisis facing public education in New. You know that we wouldn't, we would have drafted a resolution along those lines.
This year is just going crazy, but I would want to make sure our resolution has all the points that needs to be, and then it would be really great to you know to make sure we encompass all the needs in a way that, like that, We have a strong resolution.
The point would be to have a period for community feedback at the December 9th meeting on this topic, with someone like Len who's ducking away.
Don't think we need a former formal resolution in this committee to do that at the December meeting, okay and to help spread the word we can put something in the newsletter.
Unless members of the committee and I know that Lauren Connolly, a resident of the Stuyvesant town has asked to speak here tonight, So unless members of the committee have urgent matters that they would like to raise on this topic at this point, I would like to open this to questions and comments from members of the public.
And, then Ms I apologize for mispronouncing, Your name Catherine Parkerson, also looks like you have a comment on student, the student meal plans and food insecurity, which are definitely related to the topic and then Ms, Connolly.
Now, I think it's really important that in this crisis we acknowledge the potential benefits of multiple measures that are going to be needed to evaluate children for entrance to these schools, and that this could be a benefit that it might not need to be a horrible thing.
You can just donate it and someone will take it there and things are if you look at the laptops that they distribute in schools, There's a uniformity to them, So I, don't know if there's any individuals, any business members of the community that are involved in this.
I'm, a graduate student at the CUNY graduate School of Public health, I'm, not under community board.
Six, I'm, further up in community board nine, but I did want to join today on the health and education Committee.
You know you pointed some things out that I, wouldn't even think of you.
Know being an issue, but I wanted to make a comment as well as ask a question regarding the student meals.
When I was on the community Education Council, the most difficult meeting of the year for me, was when the people from the school.
You know food who actually feed the kids came, and would it would make you cry to hear how many kids depend on the school for their one-on-one hot meal of the day.
I mean sorry, I'm, a resident of Sai, Town and similar to Catherine, I'm, also a student of public health and would like to discuss issues of food and security with you.
First of all, That sounds like something that it would be hard to disagree with, and so why don't I as chair of this committee, you know simply contact first of all, our own, the city council, members, who, whose districts cover the zone of Community Board six and get their views on this.
Well, Thank you for waiting, and so is there any old or new business that members of the committee or public would like to see us address, seeing none.
