Just a few more moments, thank you. Take your time a chance. We only have one item on the agenda. So oh and I'll be quiet until things get started all right, we are now live on YouTube. You may begin. Thank you very much hi. My name is John Keller, I'm chair of the community Board six's health and Education Committee. I'm calling this meeting to order at 6:36 pm this evening on November 24 2020 and we are joined tonight not only by our district manager, Jesus Perez, but by the chair of Community Board, six Kyle at times. So we're very grateful to both of you for being here. We do need a volunteer as always to take the minutes of tonight's meeting. If anyone could do that, otherwise, I will put together a brief summary of the meeting, because I know no one else has been asked. No one was asked in advance to do it and I actually don't know I would have until the January meeting to get it done. So I'd be happy to do the minutes itself. Am I allowed to do the minute say this as chair you can, but we encourage members to do that because there is a lot of. There are a lot of demands on the time of the chair, Committee chairs, yeah, I'm looking at the who's here Abby. Would you be able to do the minutes? Yeah I can do it? Would you that would be fine. Summary minutes are always fine with the, especially since we have the recording of the meeting so Abigail Kuzmar Vice, chair of the of the health and Education Committee, will we'll take the minutes for tonight's meeting and thank you very much Abby for doing that. So I guess Jesus. Could you conduct the roll call and take the take a little sure thing, committee members good evening: I will call your name and you will unmute yourselves when your name is called please stay present I will announce if there is Quorum John Keller here. Thank you, Abigail Cruzmark. Thank you, how's, your body present. Thank you, elbi Barroso Awesome. Thank you, Dan, Divine and Devine. Please keep in mind that I can't see you all. So if you are here, please state so all right, rich Mintz, Richmonds, Phil, Napolitano President. Thank you see Michelle Present! Thank you, Sean Sherman, Andrew Shiresh. Thank you, Claude L Winfield. Thank you, Neil Barclay, Neil Barkley. All right, we do have quorum. Oh good, great! Thank you. The agenda for tonight's meeting was distributed ahead of time by the board office and appears on the screen out before you. You can see it's a straightforward agenda with one major topic. If there is no objection, we will adopt the agenda, as stated members of the committee. If you object to adopting the agenda, please raise your hand to resume, or just if we can see you raise your hand and seeing no objections. The agenda for tonight's meeting is adopted and the minutes from the October 27th meeting were also distributed ahead of time by the board office. If there is no objection, we will adopt the minutes as drafted members of the committee. If you object to about 30 minutes, you may raise your hands resume. Seeing no objection. The minutes from the October 27th meeting are adopted and they will soon be available on the CB6 website and before I introduce our our guest here. Let me just lay down some ground rules that we do at all of our committee meetings, as well as at the full board meeting we're a small group so I we tend to be a little flexible on this, but in general we ask people the committee members to ask to be recognized until granted the floor, but I'm not going to you know, fall over on that committee members. If you have a question, this is always. This is important. However, if you have a question about committee business or wish to make a motion, please raise your hand through zoom. If you click the participants icon, the participants panel should appear and you'll find the raise hand function. If you still have technical difficulty, you may click the chat, icon and relay your difficulty, but the chat function should not be used for committee business. That's what's important here or questions about agenda topics. All such remarks should be made on the record by raising your hands resume. We shouldn't have side discussions in the chat room, especially since members of the public can not or because members of the public do not have access to that chat should only be used to alert us to a technical difficulty you're having or to state an information writing such as an email address that was stated aloud on the record during the meeting when the committee member is given the floor to speak, I'll identify you and you can unmute yourself so that you can speak. If you don't think I've seen you just raise your hand and make a commotion and I will recognize you as you're a member of the committee. We are create required by executive order to create a verbatim transcript of the meeting. So please keep your questions and comments, succinct that you're made to the discussion for Abby's sake. If she takes the minutes, the order of the adopted agenda, I'm told here should be followed. So we will so the first item on our agenda tonight is a discussion of Covid-19 and school reopenings. Then we have chairs report and all the new business and in order to do business, I will certainly give our board chair, Kyle and Tide a chance to make any comments that he might make at that time or anytime. You want to speak Kyle so tonight, if you have kids in the New York School Public school system, or you read the newspapers or you listen to the media or you're otherwise, conscious in New, York city you're, aware that there is considerable discussion about how the school reopening process has been going and ongoing in the city and, as you all know, just last Thursday, the mayor announced that schools were last Wednesday. The mayor announced that schools would be closed for in-person learning, at least through the end of thanksgiving and I know from emails that we've received that we have members of the public who are very interested in weighing in on this and commenting on this, but to bring a little bit of expertise to tonight's meeting. I'm very happy that Len Silverman has made the time to join us. Len is a member of the Community Education Council for District two and but also is a member of the chancellor's parents. Advisory Committee called Cpac, and he is president of the district two presidents Council, which is the presidents of all the Pbta's in district 2 across Manhattan, and you you're either current or past president of the East side, middle PA and I. Think you have a role in another middle school in the district. So Len is here and once again, I'm going to remind people who I something I already said: don't attack landlo as an advocate who is as opposed and concerned about many of the things that are going on right now in our schools. So, but he is here as someone who's right on top of information related to what's happening in our schools, and so he's been kind enough to take time out from his evening to come here and speak to us and give us a an update as to what's going on so without further Ado Lynn Silverman. So well. First I want to thank you John. Every time I have the opportunity to address Community, Board, 6 educational council I seem to have a different title as John is correct. I am a former two-time PTA president of Eastside Middle School, and of lower lab I, have three kids in the New York City Public school system, one that's graduating from Baruch high school this year. We're not sure where he's going to end up another student at the Bronx high school of science, who is a sophomore and I, have a third grader at Ps158. So I'm in the system for a while, I'm familiar with a lot of different issues from anything from IEPS to Gibson, Talented programs, the Shsat. So any questions that I can answer, I'm happy to do so. As John said, there are three particular areas: I'm going to broaden it a little from the agenda right now. There are three particular areas that are really of serious interest and I should say more concern to New York City public school parents, and the first obviously, is that for those of you who don't know, New York City public schools are currently closed. This is a school-wide shutdown and there have been minor or I should say smaller shutdowns up to this point so, for example, ps158 which, for those of you who don't know, is located on 78th Street and York Avenue, that's where my son goes to third grade. That's been shut down for two and a half weeks already because they had a positive co, positive Covid-19 test or two positive Covid-19 tests. So the first issue that is confronting parents is this uncertainty about when schools are going to reopen- and there really has not been much guidance on that issue. So to give you an overview in terms of why they closed and I'm going to really be very general about this, I'm going to ask John. Please interrupt me if I'm giving any inaccurate information, but, as some of you may have heard, there was an agreement with the UFT and the city of New York, whereby if the positive test results went above I think it's three percent, you would have schools closed now. That sounds like it's a very reasonable agreement, but the most recent testing numbers that I'm aware of show a point or 0.22 positivity rate inside the New York City schools, I asked Deputy Chancellor Austin Adrian Austin at the last Cpac meeting last week. I said: can you give me one example of a single case of someone getting covered transmitted from a student to student teacher within a school building, and she said she would have to get back to me. She wasn't sure about that. So you have a number of parents, I mean a number I mean potentially tens of thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands that are very upset about this, and this decision to close schools is coming on top of a decision by the mayor to restrict the time period in which parents have the option of choosing blended or fully remote learning. Blended learning is a combination of the students go to school certain days of the week and then the rest of their course instruction is given online and remote learning or fully remote. Learning is exactly what it sounds like it's you're. The student does not go to school at all and they receive remote instruction right now. The latest numbers that I'm aware of that we heard last week are there 60,000, New York City school students that have no access to any type of device that will allow them to receive any type of educational instruction. That is an absolute outrage that is a horror and they're trying to address that right now, but the fact that this first started March and we're facing the situation of children in shelters, children who don't have access to Wi-fi kids, who are not getting any instruction, it's just horrible, there's, also a feeling amongst parents, particularly in school district 2, which is a school district that runs from 96th street. All the way run loops around lower Manhattan through Tribeca. There is a feeling that remote instruction is not working, certainly not a substitute for live instruction, so we've had a lot of parents in in our district that are that really want to see more in live, more live, in-person, school instruction and I and by the way, every any view that I express. Now it's not it's. Just my personal view: it's not the view of the district 2 Presidents council. It's not the view of Cpac. These are my personal views. I just want to make that clear. So that's the prime. Those are the primary issues related to school closures, but there are a few other issues. I just want to bring up very briefly and that's the admission situation that is also being impacted by Covid-19. So for those of you who don't know public school parents have to make decisions, starting in fourth grade where you, where your child, if your child is going through a k through five school, where your child is going to go to middle school, so the way that those admissions have been done in the past is you look at fourth grade gpas? Fourth grade or I should say: grades not I, know about gpas, but you look at grades and then you also look at test results and that would be on the math tests for fourth grade and the ELA English language arts exam and, as you can imagine, we haven't had those tests and we didn't have those tests last year. So, there's an incredible amount of uncertainty in terms of what the rubrics are going to be, how those decisions are going to be made for where what schools are going to accept people, what the standards are that are going to be used and also tying into that. You also have the uncertainty focused around two other areas, and that is the Shsat, which is the specialized high school admissions test, which is the test that that allows for admission to seven of the eight specialized high schools, the other one being the performing arts school Laguardia that doesn't use the Shsat, but you're talking about schools like Bronx, science and Stuyvesant, and normally the tests were being given by this time of year. So there's a feeling, certainly among parents, in our district, that there's a delay tactic or there's an uncertainty of whether or not that test is going to be given. There's been some discussion about doing it remotely, I'm not sure, what's happening in terms of the admissions as I mentioned earlier, we were supposed to have answers by July and the department of education has continually delayed any any decisions. Any guidance on those issues and finally, with regard to where kids are going to go to school, there's the gifted and talented schools and for those of you who are not familiar in order to gain admission into a gifted and talented school parents will have four year olds are usually tested, you're tested going into first grade, and then you can also have the option of retesting when you're in first grade, but most parents do it in in their kindergarten year, and this is a little more difficult because these tests are administered one by one. So I would argue, there's certainly more issues related to Covid-19 in terms of safety and security and how these tests are admission are administered, but the reality is they? No one really knows. What's going to happen, so you have a lot of schools that are looking at the possibility of not having a class next year. Now, for those of you who are conspiracy, buffs and I'm sure we don't have any of you on Community board six, there are those people, certainly in our district, who feel that the mayor and the chancellor are in fact using this or using Covid-19 as cover to kind of tweak their admissions enrollments and to change the process of gifted and talented and to push back on the specialized high school admissions test all to promote equity, which is certainly something that's very important, and you hear a lot about that and I am certainly an advocate of. We need more equity in this system, but there are there's, certainly a concern among parents in district, two that and I think the mayor actually said it was either the mayor. The Chancellor said: let's not waste, a good crisis. It's statements like those that make parents a little suspicious about what's going on. So that's those are the other issues that directly relate to Covid-19. There's one more show John's going to hate me for this: I'm just going to throw it out there you it's not an issue right now, but trust me a year from now. When things settle down, it will be an issue for this committee or that our parents in our district will be interested in and that's the crse or culturally responsive sustaining education, and that is a change in the curriculum that is going to be exactly what it sounds more culturally responsive. But it's a lot more progressive and radical than I think most people. Imagine so I think that when things settle down you will start to hear from parents like. Is this really being taught in my son or daughter's classroom? That's going to be an issue! That's coming down the pike, but again not for a year, but unlike but I, don't have any answers. There's we're very frustrated. There are many districts and I have the opportunity, as a member of Cpac, to hear from districts all around the city, but there's the frustration of not knowing when schools are going to reopen. There's a discussion. Maybe after Thanksgiving we'll get some guidance which would be fantastic, I think there's some pushback now on to renegotiate or certainly change the terms of the UFT agreement. That requires that schools be closed if the city-wide numbers go over a certain amount, but that requires parent input. It requires feedback, it requires community action and that's where I'd like to hear from everyone here and I'd like to know your feelings, so I can take them back to the chancellor and as well, but I'm here to answer any questions. Thank you for letting me ramble. I apologize if I spoke too long, but any questions that you might have I'm here to answer. One last thing: I would just tell you we're getting a new superintendent in district two, so there will be a new superintendent district superintendent denial December is leaving she's, going, leaving going out of state to take a position and we're gonna have an opening in our district. So that's another thing. That's going on in our district. It affects the students who are within the geographic confines of district 2 for and any members of, or parents of community board. Six that happen to live within those geographic confines. So that's another issue and there'll be a process of trying to find a replacement fairly soon for miss choppy any questions. First of all, thank you very much. Let's let me use the the hand raised function for members of the members of the committee with any questions or comments they might want to make, and you can also just make a comment to Len and then we'll open it up to. We have a number of attendees that I know have expressed interest in the subject, but first of all any member I'll just be quiet, because I could ramble to land at any time. John. This is one of those awkward moments. When no one has a question yeah, do you get a sense at all? You know of the I raise my I do see a hand. Claude please introduce yourself to Landon, knows the role you've played in our schools over the years. My name is Claude Winfield, I'm a former principal many years ago and former vice chair. The community board I have a question about the supplying the kids with adequate access to to education, because if you say 60,000, kids don't have access and even if they did have access, they might not have Wi-Fi and even if they did have Wi-Fi and access they might not. Have the parents support to access the computers when they're working on them I'll give you a little antidote. My granddaughter was visiting with me and she attends Hunter High School Honda, Elementary School. She was supposed to go on at 8:45 and so we're letting her do her own stuff, because you know she only comes once a week, but we're letting her do our own stuff and she's sitting there and we're waiting for her to go on. The teacher comes on about nine o'clock and she says she like takes the role and she says: I'll be back with you in an hour and the first thing I thought was where's the supervision who's monitoring. What's going on with these kids, not only at home but from the other end from the instruction, because if the person that's doing the teaching doesn't show up for an hour, you know what are your kids doing all day so I have a major concern about it, and I saw something else. Maybe you can either validate it or not? I read somewhere that somewhere in the contract of the people that are supplying the laptops to the schools that there was something missing which does not allow the laptops to leave the schools if the k, if the schools are closed in this situation, so they can't be removed from the school with the students. Do you know anything about that? Okay, so let me take the first part of your question. I just think everyone should know that's here tonight that when we say remote instruction, if you don't have a child in the system, you tend to think okay, remote instruction is really going to be there's going to be a teacher in front of a computer screen and they're going to give. You live instruction. Basically, anything that happened in the classroom during the day the teacher is just going to be doing in front of a of their own computer screen or a camera and you're going to get basically like a full day's worth of instruction, and basically anything that happened in the classroom is now going to happen in online environment, and that's not the case. So first, there are rules that the UFT has in terms of the number of live, instructional periods. I think it's limited to two right now, so as much as you would like to actually have a teacher teaching. Let's say more than a certain number of live periods, there's asynchronous instruction periods now they're trying to expand, but it's not like you're getting the same amount of time that you got before and Claude you bring up a really good point and I know it from having a third grader that you need somebody to actually sit there and put somebody on make sure they're actually doing what they're supposed to do, which requires timing and people are at home. I'm at home working I mean you're, lucky you're, only getting a child one day a week and it's very difficult and we've missed sessions. And then, if you have children with IEPS, like my third grader does or individualized education plans, you've got multiple things that you have to juggle and we're missing things. It's just very complicated and the horror is that you have parents who are not that organized who don't have access to resources who don't have fantastic, Wi-Fi or even Wi-Fi at all, where they have slow internet connections or, and these kids are literally staring at walls right now, they're, not getting any instruction and I can tell you even with a third grader. You miss a day. It's problematic, you miss a week. It's very troubling. You miss two weeks. It starts to get critical. You miss a month to a year we're talking about kids that either are gonna, have to repeat a full year of school or they're. Gonna fall behind and no one is following up on those type of kids and that's why they change the grading policies. Also so the grading policies play directly into this lack of accountability, as you mentioned so I hope. It's not acceptable that or it's a given that these kids have lost instruction for a whole year. Already it I hate to say, I think it is a given and I think that the teachers are tr, really I mean I, honestly think they're trying to do the best they can, but in many ways I think this is literally a it's an atrocity unfolding right in front of our eyes with people just kids falling behind kindergartners, first graders. Second, third, all the way up all the way up to 12th graders. You know who are looking at, maybe graduating you know and lacking basic fundamental education, and it's really problematic to my second question: how do someone like you, put pressure on the Board of Ed. to get those laptops to the kids? Okay? So to answer your second part of your question, I haven't heard so, for example, I know. Even though the buildings are technically closed, there captioning not needs a school available, they can go right into or breakfast you can go right into certain schools, they're still open. You can still get those meals that should be publicized for members of community board six. They should know that so the schools are open, so I do believe that you can get a laptop. There is a help. There are the technicians that are in certain schools right now. They can't assist in someone. Excuse me some of the technical support issues, so I haven't heard about not having access to laptops, while the schools are close, so the school's really and also there are first responders children through certain programs that are actually receiving some I understand. Some combination of live, blended learning as well, because there's just no but again these are we're showing very small percentages of New York City school students, but it is the way that what we can do as a community. What community Board six can do is again. We are strong when we stand together, you have to focus on the networks that you have to talk to parents. You have to make sure that people understand who their elected officials are, who their representatives are. You'd, be amazed how many people still don't know who those people are. Who represents you, your assembly, that man and woman, your council member, and to talk to those people to focus on so many different areas to work with your local parents association again, there's their strength in numbers, one person's not going to do it, one complaint's not going to do it. I mean I, have heard of lawsuits. That's another possibility, but again those are going to take time to work their way through the system and they're not going to bring about the critical change that we need right now, but as a community we need to mobilize, we need to demand answers and say: look you've had time to prepare. We know it's difficult. We know, there's a lot of uncertainty in many ways. They've done an admirable job, but they're failing in many other ways- and you know, there's going to be I- fear that there's going to be tens of thousands of kids, maybe even more that it could be even hundreds. Thousands of kids that are just not receiving any worthwhile education this year and that's a real horror. That is a horror. Thank you. Any other questions or comments, see Andrew or it's Andrew, Heather hi, Andrew hi. Let's first say thank you for coming in Lynn and kind of giving us a breakdown, a comment and a question. So one thing: the first thing that came to mind last week when they announced the schools were closing, and it's to your point of, like parents essentially having to work. Two jobs is really bringing to light that nearly like a million women, more probably since then, since March have like dropped out of the workforce like one in four because of like lack of child care and because of the crisis in these schools. So an unintended consequence of all of this as well, which is really concerning the question. I did have it's a very basic one, so we're above the three percent rate right now. Is there any indication that, if we drop below three percent that the schools would reopen, or is it that now that we've hit this trigger, there's no reversing it? It's just going to be closed until further notice. Okay, first in terms of your your comment, I think it's a great! You know you make a great point: I mean it's! It's just a it's, not a great situation. Right now and in terms of your question. I think this is my answer. I think you're, starting to see that the discrepancies between the governor and the mayor's position you're starting to see that pushback politically certainly the UFT seems to be kind of putting feelers out there that maybe the numbers if they go up to a certain point, I think if you read the letter of the agreement, my understanding is, you know once you're above that three percent and there's no indication that the numbers are going down. If anything, the numbers are probably going to keep on ticking up, maybe not enormously, but they're going to keep on taking up and that's a cause for concern. The question is: will there be revision where somebody says? Let's look at the numbers in schools as opposed to the numbers in the city, because I and this I've brought this up many times. It's very upsetting to me that my child's not in school, but if I, walk down. Second Avenue, I'm seeing people sitting without mass, not even six feet away with each other in these shelters, they've constructed or eating inside or people at bars, people going to gyms. So how do you and the way they're pushing back? That's, oh, we'll, be closing those two! That's what they're saying we'll be closing those eventually also, but it's kind of disturbing when you see this double standard, so I, don't I think we're going to need to have a change in the numbers that are used before you're, going to see schools before you're going to see the schools reopen unless the numbers suddenly drop unless, like, as you say, the numbers but again they're, looking at rolling averages, so they're looking at a number of days, it's not just if it drops one day. It has to drop for like five days or eight days before they're willing to take that chance, because you know people aren't. People may not be symptomatic and they're only testing, random numbers of people, it's possible. The numbers and schools are even higher, but the interesting thing is I read a statistic that 26 of New York City Department of education employees have medical waivers now, so anybody who that I mean that's an unbelievable number, if you think about it. So I would like to think that the people who are really older or pre-existing conditions are not in our school buildings. But to answer your question: I, don't think: there's I, don't think it's going to suddenly all of a sudden turn around and there's going to be a number that they're gonna pick out of a hat, I. Think they're gonna, maybe there'll be some renegotiation and someone will say: okay, maybe if the positivity rate goes up to one percent or until it hits one percent in schools or even two percent schools, then we're going to leave things up because you're right, you know my wife works from home I work, for we can't leave I can't even if I wanted to which I don't, but even if I wanted to go back to work, I couldn't do it because I'm stuck here and not that school should be child care. But the practical reality is having a child in school. Allows you to do other things, especially if you have a small child so again on your first point very well taken and you're never going to get people going back to work and you're never going to get the city restored to its function. You're going to get the people filling those downtown Midtown office spaces if they can't leave their homes, I mean that's what it comes down to so you're never going to get the city restored to the way it's it needs to be fully functional when the educational system isn't working and I I'd, say: Aussiea has her hand up and obviously, if you would introduce yourself to lead as a parent of public land thanks so much for coming, I'm actually former chair of health and education and vice chair of the board and I do have two kids one who went through the public school system, one's in high school in private now, but the other one's still in G T education downtown. So thanks so much I really appreciate it. I saw that Traeger and Johnson actually came out with a suggestion around what the school should do, focusing on in-person elementary education and and not from middle and high school I. Don't know, I haven't read through it, because I'm just curious like have you seen a response from anywhere or any other? What position people would what people think of that proposal? You know. I'm very glad you brought stuff like that up, because I just want to give you all. You know there's a way of looking at things on a micro level and there's a way of looking at things on a macro level, I'm going to give you the macro view on this whole thing. So what you're talking about is you know, proposals by by elected officials? You know clearly with an eye towards a progressive agenda, or you know, moving things changing the way things are working now, so I just want to say, I think, there's a feeling, there's an undercurrent that there's a desperation out there and I think there's an understanding that if we don't make changes now that certain elected officials feel if we don't make these changes at this point, if you can't make the changes when you can't necessarily test somebody, you've had all these barriers to rubrics that are out there. Then, when one of those changes ever going to take place so I think that's. Why you're seeing this push for ideas and legislation, particularly by what we might consider more progressive legislators or council members, to try to change this fundamental way? The system is run so I haven't seen any particular response, though so Mike John, sorry, I'm just gonna. So maybe it might be worth our committee's time to think of a response to that and say like or add to it, because if people are coming up with ideas, we should be able to come up with a response or better ideas right. In fact, what I was this is going to get us off target and Phil I noticed you had your hand up before, because I wanted to address that exactly, but Phil you had your hand up. Did you take it down for a reason, or do you still have a comment? Mr, Silverman and Andrew touched upon the question that I was going to ask I'll pass, but thank you all right. Ozzie's point is good and I'm gonna ask since Jesus is here and we have the wealth of experience of Azia and Kyle, as you know, their roles on the board over the years. If I would like to put together a resolution actually for the next full board meeting and Jesus, if we do, if I do that, can we meet right before the next full board meeting as a committee? How do we, what are the logistics of that in relation to the points such as Ozzie, was just making and also more generally, just you know, taking a very strong position as a as a board on what what led has been describing here well Asya or whatever board member who wants to put forth a motion to write. Such a resolution would clearly state that motion, and you know like that, would be the basis of the resolved clause of that resolution, and then the committee would discuss it and if the committee's, in agreement and votes on it, then that resolution can then be drafted amongst you all and preferably be ready by early December. So they can be ready to put forward at December's full board. So would we need to actually have someone, I'm sorry to take this? Take it up just with parliamentary procedure here, but would someone need to make a motion here this evening that we draft a resolution in advance of the next board meeting or how does that work? Yes, someone would, it does look like Kyle has his hand up. He would like the floor. Kyle yeah, another suggestion I was going to make too is we did this in the spring with the outdoor dining, because, obviously, everything was over very quickly, so we actually held another meeting in advance of the of the full board meeting so that we could have something put together. So you can call. Another meeting obviously would have to be public and you have to work with the staff and the committee to make sure that people can join to discuss whatever resolution is put together. Alternatively- and it's a little more difficult, so it might not necessarily but you what you want, but it would be equivalent to caucusing during the full board where you would have either a meeting right before the full board or kind of like a breakaway session during the board, but I'm not sure about the logistics of that. So those are some options that you have if you want to put something together and then discuss it before the next full board. Yeah I was thinking of. If we, if there's a consensus on the committee here, that we have a very simple resolution- I mean, but it would you know, but if there's a consensus here that we do that, then if we could get this committee to meet five minutes, 10 minutes before the full board meeting in December, you know to vote on. It is that's the thing I was thinking of doing if that's possible and I'll. You know I'll volunteer to write the resolution, but some I can't make the motion as chair to do that. John can I just say something for a moment. I mean you've been very gracious, I mean yeah. This much I just want to say, there's a real vacuum in terms of and a real opportunity here for district for Community Board six, because there really is a vacuum in terms of leadership. People are so fractured right now and we feel as if they're not organized. So, if you guys, whatever you guys, decide whether you know whatever your position is on whatever issue it, you really do have an opportunity to say something and to say it and mean something and to make a difference here, because there's so few community boards actually engaging on these issues and you're losing people I mean that's another thing. I want to mention people leaving the city, I mean we're. Looking at my son's school they've lost an entire class one class per grade. They're you're talking about I've, heard 50 to 100 families for each school in district 2. So that's thousands. You know we're talking. Thousands of people are leaving our neighborhoods. These are families with kids packing up and saying I've had it. I'm done this uncertainty. I can't take it. These are so logistically. Then it could someone make a resolution and I'm writing this on the fly here. Kyle would like the floor. Okay, sorry again, but it's just building on the point that Len just made, which is an excellent one, and obviously something that we've discussed very extensively, is about being proactive on a lot of these issues and really taking the stand and making sure that we're putting out what we want as a committee and as a board and as a community and leading that charge in terms of you know, dictating the conversation and really shaping it around the needs that we have so John again. This goes to you as chair like if you want to do something more substantive. If you want more discussion around, it obviously would have to do something in advance. You know more than five ten minutes before the meeting, so it kind of goes up to you. What exactly you're looking for this! It could be something more substantive that the committee decides that we want to take a lead on, and you know obviously garner's more discussion or we can kind of take the you know the little steps to build up to something bigger, so I will defer to you, as the chair of the committee, on what approach you'd like to take in obviously to the rest of the committee as well. Okay. So let's limit this discussion because that's it's getting late. We have members of the public that want to speak, but what I would like to if someone were to make a resolution that the committee at that this committee at the December full board meeting, have drafted a resolution in relation to the crisis facing public education in New York City today. You know that we wouldn't, we would have drafted a resolution along those lines. Citing examples such as Ozia has pointed out, I'm happy to play a major role in drafting that, but I can't make that resolution. Is there anyone who would make a resolution to that effect? Okay, so Ozzy has moved that we prepare a resolution, but can I make a comment John. My only concern is that I think that our resolution be should be reflective of what we're hearing and there are other comments from some parents here. Oh yeah, no I want to hear the parents very quickly, I, don't unless we I know, there's a rush, because I mean our kids. This year is just going crazy, but I would want to make sure our resolution has all the points that needs to be, and then it would be really great to you know to make sure we encompass all the needs in a way that, like that, we have a strong resolution, so I just don't want to rush it and have not really engage with our community about it. So that's my only head station. Are you hesitating about having it for the December meeting then or I? Just I'm, because right now, then we'll go based on what we discuss here in some ways, and it would be good to get some input from the community. We haven't. I mean Len I appreciate that your son's at Baruch, but we haven't, talked to families in our elementary schools. We haven't talked to what's going on in our you know, other things so I think it's worth at least saying that we have engaged with our elementary schools. We have talked to parents. This is what they are to asking for us, so that at Cv6, we're speaking from you know our community and we've, given them a chance to actually like make it part of a December meeting where they've actually had input yeah. But realistically, since the December meeting is one in less than what two weeks it would be hard to what is the date of the December meeting or December 9th? Is it realistic for us to have something like that put together by the night, I guess you're suggesting it might not be a resolution or just a fact that we do in December? Ask the parents for feedback like what are okay, so that we, and because we are supposed to say on public comment, a possible result. We can do things immediately if we feel that it's necessary and it comes up as a part of the topic of discussion, but it's worth saying that we're doing a possible resolution on our comments on these suggestions. What and get community feedback. So the point would be to have a period for community feedback at the December 9th meeting on this topic, with someone like Len who's ducking away. Right now, with someone like Len coming- and you know making some comments perhaps, but we also have had parents like Ps116 PTA, have joined parks and right and landmarks because they were really engaged on the St Burton's renovation and there they have a very engaged group of parents that have already gotten involved on the St Barton's redesign. I'm sure that they all have commentary on and I know with ps59. We got very engaged with yeah, so I think like I, unless you think that there's a reason for us to rush it I do think. We'd have a richer, rezzo, okay and we should like, if we're speaking for the community, we should not be speaking in a you know in a vacuum of just the people who came today or at least with the folks that are our attendees, the six other attendees, but also you know invite for public comment. Okay, so we'll proceed like that and I. Don't think we need a former formal resolution in this committee to do that at the December meeting, okay and to help spread the word we can put something in the newsletter. Maybe come up with a little item. Saying hey! If you have some thoughts on this, please write into the CB6 office or since you would have mentioned a survey, I mean we can mock a version of that survey up that can be easily taken by parents at home. Our newsletter goes out on December 1st, and you know we have almost 3,000 subscribers in the community to our newsletter and we can and I've already mocked up a survey. So that's, okay! So let's we have members of the public who are I, know anxious to speak. We've. I've had one note already in the Q&A from Jen Cerrone, for example, who has a couple of questions that she would like to raise. So unless members of the committee and I know that Lauren Connolly, a resident of the Stuyvesant town has asked to speak here tonight, so unless members of the committee have urgent matters that they would like to raise on this topic at this point, I would like to open this to questions and comments from members of the public. If that's agreeable to the committee okay, so so members of the public in attendance here I know at least two of you have identified yourselves Jen and Laura as having issues of interest than anyone else, who's in attendance and typically we allow three minutes for commentary, but we could be flexible on that and Lana if you're free to leave Vlad if you want or if you want to hang around and listen, but we certainly appreciate very much. You guys are great I'll stick around right, that's great! Okay, all right so Jesus. How do we recognize members of the public who want to be what to speak? Oh sorry, I was unmuted there, so we should go with Miss Sauron first because it does look like she has questions and comments on the agenda topic and then we'll go in order of how they were received. As for Ms Connolly, she is speaking on a separate topic and she so she will be acknowledged during new business right and then Ms I apologize for mispronouncing, your name Catherine Parkerson, also looks like you have a comment on student, the student meal plans and food insecurity, which are definitely related to the topic and then Ms Connolly. We will get to you during the new business section if that's agreeable, okay, so Asus, how do you allow well, as for Miss Saron's, so she typed out her questions and comments? Do you want to read those aloud for the record, or do you want her to? Why don't we allow her to why don't we give her a chance to to speak herself rather than me, just repeat what she wrote so that it might be better for her to speak in her own words on a topic, that's important to her all right, Mr Ron. Can you state your question and identify yourself and your affiliation? My name is Jen Saron I live in Murray Hill parent of Tui Sun I science, instructor pre-k through undergrads New, York, State, educational advocate, former legislative co-chair of Agate Association of Advocacy for gifted and talented education in New York state. The first thing I was concerned about is something that we're all concerned about: the business community, the 60 someone cited: 60,000 children, missing computers in New, York City, that's unacceptable and has the business community been involved? Is there anyone on Community board six? You know my community board who is trying to help, and you know as a part of a resolution. It might be very useful to ask that business community be involved in providing these things. They could do this so quickly, maybe in the way that the DOE could not in terms of requisitioning computers. So the second thing, the as a gifted and talented advocate for five years, but with the son, who is twice exceptional, there is a great need to have multiple measures of success in regard to evaluating a child's entrance to gifted and talented programs to specialized high schools to all sorts of access that most children in this city do not currently have because they can not pay for someone to prepare their child for a test. Now, I think it's really important that in this crisis we acknowledge the potential benefits of multiple measures that are going to be needed to evaluate children for entrance to these schools, and that this could be a benefit that it might not need to be a horrible thing happening, and the last thing is this crisis could be an opportunity to include children and empower children, rather than seeing this as a horrible thing that the teachers aren't teaching them every moment of the day. We could conceivably look at this as an opportunity to include children and empower children in their own educational progress and focus on individual interest and talent development during this downtime, with an encouragement for out-of-school, mentoring, set up using learning leaders and maybe other existing mentor networks to provide a connection between the community and our children and parents at home. I mean you've, just you've got a great job. What you've just addressed is an extremely important issue and I'm so happy to hear the phrase twice exceptional used. My kid is at one of the specialized high school Stuyvesant and you know we have just created a committee for twice exceptional to deal with the needs and issues of twice exceptional children and so I think your comments are really very timely and just encourage you to get. It sounds like you already are engaged, but len is here from the Community Education Council for District. Two, who is you know, deeply involved with these issues with the DOE, so Len Meet Jen, Meet Meatland, and you know. Hopefully, you know this could lead to a very productive collaboration, and the topic you raise is so big that we're not gonna. We could. We couldn't cover it tonight, but it's just already bubbling to the top at a lot of our schools. So thank you very much. Thank you for the opportunity. Len. Is it okay? Your is your email address a public. Would you buy? Okay, I actually have to get my wallet to tell you my cc email address, but anyone can any one of you can contact me anytime. You want it's very simple. It's I'll type it here in the I'll type it in the chat, so it's available for anyone. I'm always happy to talk to any parents that need any help any way. I can assist. You I'm happy to do it. You know it's a very important topic. I think the question was great. The commentary was great. I think the default is that the city is looking at going away from gift and talent program, shifting away and more towards enrichment programs and more towards specialized classes or instruction. So I'm not sure if the car, if they want to maintain the current system as it exists, I do agree about. We need more enter data points. It shouldn't really be one test, necessarily that controls for this and there's definitely the inequities in the lack of resources that parents have that's again. An equity issue that's been around for a long time, and that really needs to be addressed here and that's that's something that I think the city needs to do a better job, preparing kids for for those tests. Thank you, okay, so so yeah. So you okay! So it's a good connection made and it's a very important topic, and then we had us another question about related to I. I'm sure it's still up here, student meal plans and food insecurity by Ms, Parker John. Before we get to that question, it looks like Abby would like the floor. Oh okay, I would go ahead. I just wanted to quickly follow up on Jen's point about devices and amazing, with the business community and asklen, if that's happening, and if it isn't, if you think that it would be more productive for that liaison to go through the DOE or to be separate or what would that look like? So I'm not sure. Could you like kind of just elaborate, a little more? What you mean I'll be happy to right. Well, here's the problem. You know it's not only just the device, it's that it has to have certain software installed on it has to be. You know you have to make sure there's nothing inappropriate. That's on the device! There are security issues there that so it's not just a question of okay. Somebody has an old laptop. You can just donate it and someone will take it there and things are if you look at the laptops that they distribute in schools, there's a uniformity to them. Schools tend to all have the same type of laptop and I. Think that's for a reason. So I don't know if there's any individuals, any business members of the community that are involved in this. That's a great thing to look into I'll try to get an answer from district 2 for you, but a lot of this is people have resources. They don't know how to get it to the people that have the resources and even when they want to do it. There's so many roadblocks in terms of the requirements and the laws and the regulations that it just makes it very difficult to do so. I will look into that, for you have my word. I will follow up on that and see if there's a way to get some feedback about, maybe getting the community involved to either purchase systems. But it's again it's not really a money issue. I just want to be clear: it's not a money issue, it's the actually getting a device into someone's hands that works, and it's not easy always to track people down. So there's a lot of other issues here, but 60,000 is the number that the mayor and the chancellor mentioned. So that's pretty scary. Okay, thank you. Abby does that for now satisfy your question or is that okay? Then, this far crystal, you have a question comment regarding the student meal plans and food insecurity: Mrs Farksman, if you could unmute yourself state your name and your affiliation and your question: okay, hi, my name is Catherine Farkasan, I'm a graduate student at the CUNY graduate School of Public health, I'm not under community board. Six, I'm further up in community board nine, but I did want to join today on the health and education Committee. When you pointed out some issues that I wasn't even aware of regarding the cover 19 pandemic and the effects that it has had for you know students and for parents- I'm not a parent myself, but you know you pointed some things out that I, wouldn't even think of you, know being an issue, but I wanted to make a comment as well as ask a question regarding the student meals. You know food and security being a big thing in New, York City, even prior to the cover 19 pandemic. We had you know: 1.2 million New, York City residents that were already food insecure one. In five students you know were food insecure. You did mention public schools having the free breakfast and the free lunch is still available, but I wanted to first and foremost, ask you if you're aware of the local legislation by Jamani Williams, it was proposed in August 2020 right during the peak of the cove at 19 pandemic. Basically, what the proposed bill would do is secure those student meals, those breakfasts those lunches as well as include dinner, and it has a preparedness plan behind it. That will include how the information include information for the public on how they can access those meals, distribution, points, etc. So, first and foremost, I wanted to ask if you were aware of the local legislation and your thoughts on it, and you know moving forward in the committee as well- not just Lynn, but the committee as well. What are you guys's thoughts on that food insecurity and those student meal plans? Sure I mean that's such a great I mean the fact that there are kids that actually go hungry every single day in our city is so troubling, and it's in it's true I mean people. Just don't have access to meals. I did want to say that the schools that are open the schools that you can go to get meals. You don't have to go back every single time for a meal. You can go in the morning and you can ask and they will give you multiple meals. They will give you as many meals as you want up to a certain I figure out. What the number is, there's a limitation on it. But if you have family members that need meals, we need to do a better job at feeding our families, and you don't think about it. Really when you're, when you live on the Upper East side or in Midtown or downtown in our communities. But food is a very basic requirement that a lot it's not being met for a lot of people and people with families and kids. So I I've heard I remember reading about something that was proposed. I, don't know all the specifics. I think that's fantastic! If you could bring another meal and figure out a way to get that done. To have dinner. I mean I. Think that's great because our schools- it's not just the educational, it's not just the educational purpose they serve, but as I mentioned before, the it is the serving of the meals. For example, I mean that's so important to the members of our community, particularly and when I was on the community Education Council, the most difficult meeting of the year for me, was when the people from the school you know food who actually feed the kids came, and would it would make you cry to hear how many kids depend on the school for their one-on-one hot meal of the day I mean that was the saddest meeting of the year. For me, Ms Farquharson, do you have a link that you can put in the chat or email to the office about the public advocates proposed legislation? I know I heard of it, but I just I have to admit I'm not on top of it today as I and by the way, it's not just kids that can get meals. It's adults too adults can get meals too. So, okay, but thank you so much for raising about you know the schools serve the meals depending on whether the schools are open or closed. If the schools are open, you can pick up their meals in the morning at certain time periods like after 9:30, they will give you the breakfast and they will give you lunch. If the schools are closed, then you have to pick up and you have limited schools when the schools are closed, they, preferably like the high schools, will distribute lunch, but they will distribute to you and, depending on the people that you're getting the food from, they will allow you to pick up from one to five lunches if you ask for them, they'll give them to you. There is a problem, though, if you ask the schools to do dinner, then you're creating a whole different problem, a whole different scenario, because you're talking about storage, Et, cetera and it's easier for them to make lunches overnight, store them and then hand them out in the morning. But if you're going from one to two to three meals a day, there is a difficulty involved. Okay, so that's the thing: I guess that we have legislators for to sort through and work out. So thank you and Ms Parker said thank you for bringing up this topic because that and miss sarin as well. Those are two issues that you don't get enough attention and thank you so much to both of you. Okay, so we I think is that I think those are all the comments. I know we have one for that's going to come up under new business from Ms Connolly. Are there any other comments from the public? We always we're going a little over time tonight, but I think it's a topic. These are topics well worth taking a few extra moments on so Jesus does any other member of the public want to be recognized other than Ms Connolly, whom we will get to? No I did thank you and I'm going to because we are over time going to waive my chairs report, but I will defer to the board chair, Kyle at tide who was here if he would like to take this occasion to make any comments Kyle, you would you like to fill in my shares report time with anything. You would like to speak about nothing big. If anyone followed the executive committee meeting that we had the other week, one of the big changes that will be coming up in the new year is that we will be pulling out public health from this committee so that this committee can focus solely on education issues. So you'll be hearing more information about that. Most of you have been aware of that. So that's all I have on my end, but more details are forthcoming on that, but yeah I liked everything I heard today, yeah. That was a very delicate way on my part of giving you a chance to make that announcement, but not did not make an announcement before you made it appreciate it. Thank you, okay. So we're gonna move on to old and new business and a member of the public Lauren Conley, a resident of status of town has asked to speak in new business related on city Council, Reso, 0170 2018, but calling upon the New York City Department of Education to offer kosher and halal meals in the summer meal program summer meals, program. Lauren. Thank you for your patience. You have the floor for three minutes hi. Thank you! So much so again, I'm a member I mean sorry, I'm a resident of Sai, Town and similar to Catherine, I'm also a student of public health and would like to discuss issues of food and security with you. So, as was just mentioned when schools are closed, there are a number of sites throughout the five boroughs where students can pick up the free meals that they are eligible for, including during the summer, but unfortunately, only 12 of those sites are certified to prepare kosher foods and only 10 are certified to prepare halal foods, meaning if you don't live near one of those sites. Children, keeping kosher or halal are offered a vegetarian grab-and-go meal as at their local community pick-up site instead of a freshly prepared religious friendly meal. So, for example, for us in lower Manhattan, there are not any kosher or halal certified sites in our neighborhood, meaning that muslim and jewish children in our neighborhood need to travel to the nearest halal or kosher site, which is West 96th street or in Brooklyn, so to address the need for inclusion of kosher and halal meals in the DOE in 2018, a legislation was proposed by two New York City Council members calling upon the New York city DOE, to offer kosher and halal meals in the summer meals program. Again, that's resolution 0170-2018. But since its introduction, the resolution has been held in committee. Fortunately over the past year or so, the city has taken a few steps towards ensuring better access to kosher and halal meals, for example, the kosher and Halal School Lunch pilot program, that's currently underway through the comptroller's office, as well as the certification of those 22 sites that I mentioned in the beginning, but ensuring access to religious, friendly meals to children. Who may be food insecure needs, legal protection, and I'm asking for this word support in helping move forward resolution zero, one, seven Zero-2018 in any way that you can support it and I'm interested in assessing if we think that our neighborhood could benefit from advocating for a kosher halal site within our neighborhood, so that there are more options to jewish and muslim children other than just a vegetarian grab-and-go option. First of all, thank you very much. Do you know who sponsored zero 170 2018? Do you know who the sponsor is? Yes, it's councilman Livian and Council Woman, Adams, okay, well, I! Guess a good next step on this. First of all, that sounds like something that it would be hard to disagree with, and so why don't I as chair of this committee, you know simply contact first of all, our own, the city council members, who, whose districts cover the zone of Community Board six and get their views on this, and then this would sound like something that you know. We could easily put together a resolution in support of for the community board six to to support so Laura. Could you Lauren? Is it Lauren or Laura I apologize, Laura, it's okay! Would you could you the office? Has your contact information I believe so you don't need to make that public, but why don't I and the office get back to you and we will I will get in touch with the offices of our district, just the council members and see if they're, because that sounds like something that they would all be eager to here to support. Thank you. I really appreciate it. Well, thank you for waiting, and so is there any old or new business that members of the committee or public would like to see us address, seeing none. This has been a very interesting productive and useful meeting. I. Think of the health and Education Committee and I was very happy to hear Kyle announced that we're going to be splitting health and education's part parts of this committee, because I think that's a very good idea and I know there's a lot of discussion that has to take place at the board as we do that so seeing no other new business. I'm going to adjourn this meeting. If there is no objection, so I'm adjourning the meeting at 7:45 pm. Thank you, Len, very much for being here and thanks to all the members of the public who who were here as well and offered such valuable comments you there were several topics that were I'm just delighted to hear getting on. You know getting out of time. Thank you all I appreciate it. Thank you.
