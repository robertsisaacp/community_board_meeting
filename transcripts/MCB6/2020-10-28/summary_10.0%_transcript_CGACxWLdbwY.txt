Had originally hoped to have a forum this evening, with, on the subject of the mental health effects of Covid-19 and Council member Rivera and her office were extremely helpful, as we were trying to put that together, but due to an illness, we were unable to get that.
It is at the top of our agenda for for the next month's meeting, and I wish to thank Katie and Iraq and Pedro from the council members Office for their patients help this week.
I want to say thank you, everybody for inviting us to your meeting of the CB6 health committee as agreed to we're here, tonight, at the request of the board, to do a presentation on a progress update of the work that we're conducting at the school.
I. Just want to note that everybody should be well aware that we were paused during the Covid-19 crisis from March until we were released from, we received a release from the city in July to come back to work at the Washington Irving high school, where monies were released to allow us to unpause the job and to go back in without further ado, and just to set that table.
That work was completed really on time, and you know, Covid-19 has certainly not helped the situation.
One of the things that Covid-19 has presented us with in terms of challenges is not only the time that we lost in not being able to work on the project, but in order to resume work we had to we meaning the contractor, and we had to we meaning school construction.
It's exponential, in that it's taking us more time to complete the remaining work, and Every day and now, With students back in the school, we have to observe department of education protocols which are very similar, but there are a number of checks and balances that we have to.
I would like, first of all, to open this to any questions or concerns from members of the committee in regard.
Meetings, and you know if you go over a few seconds, no one's going to argue about that, and also ask you not to use the chat function for anything for any committee business or questions about agenda topics, so not to use it for that purpose.
I live directly opposite the construction I understand that that's part of construction, but there is a lot of noise in the evening time and late at night, And I think with the additional kind of pickups of garbage and things like that It's.
In terms of obviously, the construction is going to continue What I would like to suggest is you know that you and anyone else in the community contact me directly.
Now, I'm, not going to bother principals, who are trying to keep people alive, but I will figure out the right, way, working with Council member Rivera's office to get some response to this, because the way you presented that to me-And the way you just spoke-makes me very much want to figure a way to work with you and help you.
And worked with the council member's office and as as you stated, and as I heard in the comments from the community, we do send out the two-.
You can contact me through the Community board and then I will quickly give you a direct way to contact me And, then we'll talk to Council member Rivera's office and figure the right approach to the to the schools.
Unless, there is an objection from a committee member is we'll move ahead with the chairs John we'd like to say thank you for having us All right again.
And I'll go through it quickly, because I know I want to finish and end up by 7:35, and so the first thing I'm going to comment is not in the presentation, and that is that we are beginning to get anecdotally more than just anecdotal information on the loss of students in our our schools.
And I'll certainly be reaching out to Council member Rivera's office and Keith powers and Ben Kalos to put the heat on tweed, because right, now, they're, what's been, said, is they're going to review the information, and we do not want that to go on for months.
I was talking today, for example, to a apparent leader who said that you know this is a someone who actually sits down with her kid, and you know, and they're learning is in pre-k and learning to write, and so she has to take the pencil and help the kids move the pencil over the over the outline of the work they're doing, and she pointed out, I'm so fortunate that I can be home to help my kid do this, but there are kids in our schools who have not had a pencil in their hands since since February or March, and the long-term effects of this are things that we're just going to begin to understand, and here is a summary of the revised grading policy as it affects as it affects each grade.
What percent of students lack sufficient access to computers or laptops that has been in the news in the last few days, and I know one school that one of my kids attends where the head of guidance is actually taking the laptops.
It might be a little bit more accessible for those that do you know those that do have the time to volunteer and are involved in the schools.
It's, always an issue because you know I'm a Pa vice president and been involved for a long time in our schools, and you know we do not have access to parents information unless they give it to us, but we could ask you're suggesting that we should ask the administration to distribute it.
To talk about Covid-19 in the schools as well, but Are there, any other questions or comments from the committee?
