So please keep all questions and comments, succinct and germaine to the discussion. So the order of the adopted agenda is going to be followed. Today we will be having a discussion on indoor dining and extending outdoor dining, we'll then transition into a conversation on reopening broadway and movie theaters, and then just you know, housekeeping chairs report and older new business. So after the committee discussion of each agenda item we'll just follow the same ground rules as before so cody. If you could pull up the articles that I have ready for tonight, I'd like to start this conversation on indoor, dining and outdoor and extending outdoor dining, to provide context for our conversation and just some guidelines and then also for those from the public who are attending. So you can follow along. We had this conversation last month about extending outdoor dining the day off our full board meeting, which we had voted on passing. That was when the governor announced that they would be allowing indoor dining at 25% capacity, obviously up to 50, and so I wanted to put the conversation on hold until our committee meeting this time around. Just because there was a lot of information going around. There were a lot of feelings and just a lot to determine before kind of you know celebrating the news. So I sent out a couple of these articles they're up on our screen, but I just want to open it up for initial comments and thoughts from the committee on what they're hearing, what they're, thinking and yeah and we'll just take it from there Genie go ahead. Oh hi, good evening, everyone, hey kyle, you know I've been reading all of these articles since the beginning of this, and it seemed I just do not know how much we could it's all it's not going to come down to dollars at this point. Reading all the articles that you shared with us earlier today, and thank you for that. You know we have the outside dining and then, by beginning of next month, 25% capacity and restaurants still not going to be enough, especially for the smaller businesses. I just do not know. I think the thrust should be getting the dollars into the city. I do not think there's anywhere else that we can save the city other than to get the dollars into the city and that's going going to have to come from the federal coffers and from Albany. Otherwise, without that money. These restaurants will not survive if they go up to 50 capacity, 75 capacity- I do not know I'm not. I do not see any of the solution at this point. Okay, thank you. Susan I've been doing some outdoors. Excuse me outdoor dining, and I feel it's a wonderful thing. I feel fairly safe doing it and I certainly think that outdoor dining should be extended in the cold weather and that their heat, lamps or whatever needs to be used should be used in terms of the indoor dining. I think it should be allowed. You know 25 percent or even 50 percent, and I think people are going to have to make up their own minds. I agree with Deeney. I think that you know we really need this. City needs income and a lot of businesses. Restaurants and bars are falling behind really badly. You know they're, not they have not paid their rent for months, and you know if we can't depend on federal funds. I do not know what else to do yeah. I know so that's a great point. So the- and you know further context that I want to put to this too- is that. Are there a couple of different things going on when this was first announced? Obviously, a lot of people very ecstatic that outdoor dining is coming back, but it is much more nuanced than it seems at first. The first thing is that 25% capacity, 50 capacity even does not necessarily provide the revenue and the income that these businesses need to carry on, so to say that okay, we're having indoor dining but outdoor dining is expiring at the end of October kind of you know still creates the same problem to be the economic problem, rather to begin with, which is that the businesses are not able to Genera generate enough revenue to pay the bills, and so from this article can see that nine out of every 10 restaurants and bars in New York City can't pay full rent right now. This is 90 right. This is pretty much the city. The other part of it, too, is that safety concerns from the owners and employees themselves. As I'm sure, everyone saw, there's been a lot of articles of operators and even workers saying that they do not feel comfortable with indoor dining, even if it is allowed, because they're just not sure what's going on with public health, and you know a possible second wave of this going on it's just it's not comfortable for them to operate as well and then going to Susan's point. This is just kind of how I'm thinking about it is we've seen outdoor dining work. Obviously, there are kinks in the system to begin with, because this is unprecedented, so that is to be expected. But as time has gone, I think it's become more organized. I think it's become safe. I think it's actually a way for each business to do something unique with their space as well. I've kind of described it as like a high school locker. Everyone is kind of decorated as their own way, they've put up their own stuff and it's really cool to see that. I think it's kind of harking us back to pre- K New York City, where people are showing their personalities, their vibes, and I think that's a really great thing and I think, at the end of the day, the idea is allowing for people to make decisions on their own. I think allowing and extending outdoor dining if restaurants can figure out a way to make that comfortable in colder weather in inclement weather. I say: go for it and if people want to eat out there and drink out there, I think they should have that right to do so. I think there can be certain you know restrictions put in if there is you know, flood warnings or snow warnings or things of that nature. You know that on those certain days they can be told not to put anything outside, but I think as a whole. This is something that people have liked, that it has worked for a lot of people, and if people want to make those choices for themselves, they should have that choice to do so. Moving on to John yeah hi yeah, just first of all, I am I unmuted yeah. Okay, I apologize. If this was in any of the articles you said, but what margin does the average? You know sort of mid- range- restaurant, I'm not talking. You know the you know the you know phase or what margin do they work operate under to begin with, because even at 50 capacity, it would seem to me to be that so much of the cost is fixed cost related to the you know the space and the wrench, and you know I just it's going to be so hard to do for them to survive even at 50 percent. But what do we does? Anyone know who knows more about the business than I do. What kind of margin a mid- range restaurant, where you could go out and get an option, you're saying like what would the minimum be yeah? What is for them to break even yeah? What is the margin they operate on? What percent like? Is it 20 or 10? I mean I'm just curious, you know, because my guess is, it's pretty low for most of and like a supermarket operates sort of five percent margin, often so if they lose a lot of their, you know regular business they're in trouble so yeah, so that so that's the concern here. I think and the second question. The second observation is, it would be really how sophisticated are the you know. The heating units that you could put in outside I've seen some restaurants, but they look like they're higher margin. Restaurants is the problem by original question. So yes, so actually cody can you go to the outdoor dining article? The legislation so what's written in that is that right now, propane is not allowed on streets like a propane heating, which is what you probably see so part of the new legislation. There's a hearing on September 30th. So I would encourage if you can attend to attend, but one of the one of the parts of the legislation is that right now, propane heating is not allowed on the streets for heating. I think, probably that made sense at one point, but as part of this, especially as we think about colder colder times, something like that is is going to be needed. What we've seen I mean throughout the world too, like obviously other countries have done this as well, and I think I saw an article somewhere in New York City of some restaurant using this method, but they had those bubbles, like those plastic bubbles that people could sit inside, so that's a form of insulation that they could use as well. I mean I think part of this is that there are people who are going to say you know what I'm willing to you know suck it up and deal with some cold. If that means that I can support a local, restaurant or bar, but that's again up to them, and I think they should have that option if they want to. I think businesses are smart and they'll say you know what, if no one's showing up to this, I'm not going to put you know, tables outside, because no one's showing up. So I think it's kind of self- policing a little bit on that. Just kind of you know logic to have that if people are showing up they'll have it out if people are not, I do not see them doing that, but it's about giving them the option to do that beyond October 31st, yeah Susan. I just have a question: are the heat lamps that I'm thinking of the same? That's what I'm thinking about propane? Are they propane the heat? Lamp? Sorry, can you repeat that heat lamps I've experienced them out of the city? Are they are they? I thought they were just like electric feeders or well some of yeah, so some of them are electric, but I think for some, it's more efficient to use propane or they want the option to use propane. The part of this bill is allowing that cody. Could you go to this section in the article where it talks about? I think it's propane or butane. I forget all right there yeah, the third paragraph, so the bill also stipulates that outdoor propane heaters, which New York City restaurants currently can't use, would be legalized to facilitate outdoor dining in the winter. So I think it gives just another option again. You know with the electric you either have to get generators which also take up space or you're running cords along pedestrian space into your establishment. So I think this just gives another option, because I think a lot of people would use propane or and remember it does not need to be like a huge propane tank. You know, that's kind of you know, making people fearful of stuff. You can use. You know small propane tanks that people use on camping or whatever it is to create. You know little heaters, which are also safe youssef. I see your hand up yeah just to the point earlier on margins and again it's tough to speculate. Acrosss, all restaurants, but I mean margins in some cases, are you know five percent on average, but they range between five and call it fifteen percent so, and this is full capacity, kind of seasonality, etc. So oftentimes restaurants just have very little room that they're that they're playing with in terms of additional costs they can incur or take on yeah. That's I have my head up that that's what I was worried about, that you know a mid- price range restaurant where you get an entree, for you know a nice entree for fifteen to twenty dollars. You know you know not fifty dollars. I doubt they're working on much more of a margin than ten or fifteen percent. I mean that would be you know. Yeah I mean if you remember from the presentation that the restaurant wrote East Alliance made to us back in like what was it April? I think it was April or may when they were talking about the outdoor dining they mentioned. You know that their margins were super low and that even outdoor dining was not necessarily going to address it, but it was going to help out to generate something rather than nothing before I move on to other speakers. I just want to remind members of the public who are attending you're free to ask questions and answers as well. There's a Q&A button. So, if you'd like to participate in the conversation, we're having, please feel free to do so, Kevin yeah along those lines, I'm just looking there's a there's, a CB6 resident, who I really respect, he happens to be a chef- has been an international chef but he's in New York based in New York. Now somebody had posted on Facebook. I see there was a six square feet story today. It looks like outdoor dining in New, York City could be ready made for permanent in winter and his response was. This is a public response, so I think it's okay to share throwing band- Aids at an industry that requires a multi- billion dollar funded bailout to survive to date, zero dollars, heated lamps and propane tanks really yeah. I just want to go off that other side, not so much to be a full- blown advocate of what he's saying, but I think it's important to get that side out as well yeah. I agree thanks for that comment. Kevin you're, welcome Kevin. Can your Peter said that you kind of went out on my sure I'll be happy to and again this is somebody who's been in the in the restaurant industry for a long time very respected, I'd love to read his resume, but he is a CB6 resident. Let me pull that back up again, so this is an article which we should look at. It sounds six square feet again. The article headline is outdoor dining in New, York City could be made permanent and winter ready. He responded just a few minutes ago, throwing band- Aids at an industry that requires a multi- billion dollar funded bailout to survive to date, zero dollars, heated lamps and propane tanks. Really so again, let's I just wanted to throw that in the conversation and who said that again sorry, his hat name happens to be Neil Kane and he again is a CB6 resident, who I really respect on his voice in the restaurant industry. All right, thank you for that Matt Bondi. Thank you, Kyle, just to understand what we're voting on. Are we going to vote on something? Are we talking about supporting a bill that will essentially legalize propane heaters? Is that what it is? No, so, basically, this is an extension of our conversation from last month. As you remember, at our last committee meeting, there was no transparency or anything about the plan for restaurants after October 31st, when author dining expires about indoor dining in particular, so we had put a resolution together, which we all voted in the affirmative on to have the city put together a plan by September 30th that you know established a transparent process and where they were at in their own processes and discussions on indoor dining and reopening up restaurants. Of course, the day of our full board meeting is when the governor and Mayor announced that indoor dining would resume at the end of September at 25, and then I believe, going up to 50 in later months. So I pulled that a resolution off of our docket, because it was no longer relevant and instead put it on this meeting, where we would discuss more in depth about indoor dining and extending outdoor dining, because there is. There are a lot of caveats to that in particular. What we mentioned earlier at the top of this meeting was that first of all, 25 to 50 is not necessarily helping businesses. As you know, Kevin mentioned in the article. It's not necessarily helping, and neither is outdoor dining to be completely honest. It's just something rather than nothing. So we wanted to talk about first of all, indoor dining about the 25 to 50 percent, because first of all, even the restaurants themselves are not necessarily comfortable open reopening up with indoor dining because of health concerns same with the employees, they're also afraid of hiring people for indoor dining and then having some second wave, come acrosss and then having to re- close again and then having to fire people. So there are those concerns, but the main one was that October 31st is the deadline for outdoor dining, and that still seems to be the case. But there are a lot of conversations about extending outdoor dining throughout the year, so it would not expire on October 31st, but restaurants would have that option to continue into the cold months as well, and part of the legislation that's being proposed is that obviously weather is a big concern for patrons particularly cold weather. So part of this legislation allows for propane heaters to be used in the you know, designated space for outdoor dining to make sure that patrons are warm. So that's just part of the legislation. Obviously the big meat of it is that outdoor dining can be extended after October 31st. So restaurants can still use this as an option if they can find a way to make it comfortable for customers that they should have the option to do so, and then, of course, if, as a customer, you choose to do that, you can do that and if you choose not to, obviously you can choose not to so that's the big conversation. We're having right now is just on this two- part bill which is first of all indoor, dining and then extending outdoor dining after October 31st. So what we would vote on is supporting this proposed legislation. I did remind people that on September 30th there is a hearing on this proposed legislation, but of course, because it's still in formation essentially there's a lot of opportunity for us to really lay out the things that we'd want to see in any extended outdoor dining, and so one of a couple of the things that I mentioned as an example are that we could, you know, require them to to remove all outdoor dining in the cases of inclement weather. If there's flood warnings coming acrosss, if there's you know a blizzard warning things of that nature, where we could say in those cases you know restaurants should not be, you know, putting out any tables or chairs or anything like that. So that's just where we are in the conversation now I do not know do you have any initial thoughts on it, matt on extending outdoor dining past October 31st? Well, you know it's funny. I I'm all for helping the restaurants do whatever they can. I mean I do understand that it's such a difficult time for everybody that you know by extending it maybe another month, because it's going to come a point in New York City when it gets too cold to be comfortable outside and there's really not a whole lot. You can do to prepare an outdoor area for that cold weather in December and January and February short of maybe enclosing the size of your outdoor seating area, which defeats the purpose. And then you know we run the risk of running gas heaters inside of an enclosed area and the dangers that come with that. But I had not even thought about the need for potentially the need for snow, plowing and you're right. I mean a lot of these structures seem pretty solid and I there are a lot of things that go along with propane in New, York City- and I remember this just you know a little bit from when I worked for the city in terms of the regulations that are involved with propane transporting propane throughout the city. And you know the ration now behind those laws. So it'll be interesting to hear how the fire department, I think, feels about all this at the hearing and what their position is. Of course you know I'd be guided by them and I'm always guided by the health authorities. But you know if you can allow propane to be used by hot dog hearts and there are. There are commissaries where food vendors park their carts and I think they might be special dispensation and licensing involved with people who supply propane to the food cart industry, and I think there might be workarounds to make it safe to transport and use propane at outdoor restaurants. I just do not know how effective it's going to be beyond a certain point, but even if it's a month, you know that's another month that they can make people comfortable, yeah, November, so one of the yeah. So one of the things that we were talking about was how essentially this could be self- policing so even like, let's for argument's sake, say that they have 365 days that they can utilize outdoor dining for which includes in the depths of January and February. Businesses are not going to put out tables and chairs if no one's showing up to that right. So if you know people are not showing up they're going to obviously not have staff outside they're, not going to you know, put things outside, but if they do that's a you know another source of revenue that they can utilize for them. I mean I personally, I do not know if I'd be sitting at a restaurant in the middle of a blizzard or in the middle of a storm, but I know that there are. This is New York City that I'm sure that there are enough people who would do that and if they're willing to you know, support a restaurant in that way, I think I think it's all about having the option to do it rather than assuming that everyone would be using outdoor dining space. You know, even in cold weather, I think also the propane is just another- is just another option for people to insulate. I mentioned earlier on the meeting that I forget where it is exactly, but there was some restaurant that was using those like plastic bubbles right and even in some winter, you know how you have those outdoor cody, I'm forgetting the word for it, but you know those entrances that they have those temporary entrances in the winter that people can walk into the restaurant. Something of that material. You know if you're, using Qualico or plexiglas or something like that to enclose the space to keep it insulated is an option that they can use, but some people might want to use propane and I think they're just allowing for that to be an option. So there any other thoughts on this is. Does anyone want to make a motion to support this piece of legislation? That's out there and remember, we can add our own stipulations to this. So if we want to add that you know there should be absolutely no outdoor dining. If there's a flood warning- or you know some kind of weather warning that they should have you know all tables and chairs and other materials inside, we can add that to a resolution. This is just simply about extending outdoor dining past October 31st, hey this is this is use if I would actually motion to support the existing legislation. Second seconded by Susan, all right, so we'll take a vote on it. So just so, everyone is clear, we're taking on a vote, taking a vote on supporting this bill and before we get to that vote, does anyone want to include things of that nature of you know, making sure that inclement weather is something is a stipulation or anything like that? Are there any other stipulations we'd like to add to this, because remember this piece of legislation will also be going on. You know undergoing some changes, I'm assuming because there's a public hearing on it on the 30th, but if no one has anything to add to it, we can just vote straight up on how it's written. I would, I would actually suggest inputting some stipulations about inclement weather, just to make sure that that's fully written outside because as Matt mentioned before, particularly for emergency services- or you know, street cleanings, especially during blizzards and things of that nature, we want to make sure that the streets are clear. So I would ask to include that in a resolution. Is there any objection to that? If there is please raise your hand, just a stipulation, obviously, the restaurants are going to need some sort of warning more than a couple hours and sometimes, if it snows without being predicted, then I mean is that going to put pressure on the restaurant owners to be able to have to move it? You know at a moment's notice. I think that's too much to to ask of said owners, so I think yeah, I'm thinking more, like I'm thinking more proactively, because you know, usually we have these weather warnings like a blizzard or storm. Is you know coming? We can require that the city give them. I do not know 48 hours or I do not know. 24 hours is too quick notice to make sure that on certain days that they should not have it out in this room yeah, I think they deserve that. To could not happen. Absolutely good thanks all right. So seeing no other comments. Cody will just go to the vote all right. One moment please: okay, committee members, I'll call your name and then just declare your vote in favor against abstain, not entitled kyle. If I am for it all right, Matt, Bondi or all right. Dan is not here still Genie Dinofrio favor Charles, Fernandez, favorite, Paige, Judge, Ford, Yusuf Khalid in Favor, John Keller, oh in Favor, Kevin O'keefe in favor. All right see: Michelle, Seema. Sorry, the thing was not unmeeting. Sorry. Can you guys hear me or no I'm sorry? Yes, we can hear you okay, great, I'm in favor. Thank you, Susan Steinberg in favor, all right, that's 10 in favor! No against no abstentions, fantastic! Thank you! Everybody all right! So, let's move on to the second topic, and this is obviously coming out of the research on indoor, dining and outdoor dining. One of the things I think has been sort of fallen off. The wayside in the last couple of months has been broadway, theaters and movie theaters and at the time it made a lot of sense, obviously with capacity and everything like that, but as we're opening reopening a lot of things, particularly with restaurants, at a limited capacity. Of course, I thought this is a great time to re- open the conversation on theaters in the city. Obviously, Broadway has been decimated by this and as a reminder, you know. Obviously it's not just the actors on stage but there's a whole industry of costume designers and makeup artists and choreographers. You know stage tech, etc that have been affected by this as well, and so, as the conversation has opened up about, you know, reopening restaurants at limited capacity. I thought this could also be a time to discuss reopening theaters at a limited capacity and cody. Could you pull up that most recent article that I sent the June 2020 article on Broadway theaters, so the last article that I could really find about the future of broadway theaters? The opening was in June 2020, which was obviously at a different point in all of this. That reopenings would not happen until January 3rd, which is obviously still a long ways from now. Some of them, if you were able to read the article, some shows have already said that they would not be returning even after everything reopened tentatively on January. Third, so I thought this would be a time to open up the conversation on it. I do not know what people think about you know. I was thinking very similarly if we're opening up restaurants at limited capacity, that we should give theaters, whether they be broadway or movie theaters the ability to open up a limited capacity as well, and obviously there are ways to do this. You know very similar to how some restaurants are operating with online reservations and anyone who's. You know gone to any type of theater in the past couple of years. You know you've probably done it through an app or online, where you can pick your seat so thinking about limited capacity and how you know, theaters, whether it be broadway or movie, could black out seats to make sure that capacity is limited, but also that people are not sitting. You know next to one another that they have the ability to do so so I'll open up that conversation and I see a hand up from John. I think Susan had her hand up before me I'll defer. Okay, Susan. Would you like to go? Oh that's, sweet! John! Thank you. I was just going to say I could I think it's an easier thing for movies to do because they have you know the audience is passive, so every other seat and everyone's mast and that's fine. But when you have a broadway show you not only do you have actors that are close together on stage and frankly, I just can't imagine them acting with masks on, but maybe it's possible the Greeks did it, but you know I said it's not just that. It said all the tech, the stagecraft people are working closely together, so I am concerned about that aspect of Broadway shows. Susan came out definitely slightly different angle that I was going to come at it from because I think it's it's the margin issue again. I suspect that Broadway shows have a lot more fixed costs associated with them than a movie theater I'd. I'm not involved, I'm not knowledgeable on that, but I would imagine they would and I think it would be a lot more difficult though I would be supportive of it if it was economically feasible. You know okay shows to to open, but yeah the economics might not work as much as well as they would work in the movie theater, but I'm open to being proven wrong on that yeah and remember so part of this, and at least you know, the chair of the committee, how I like to use resolutions is sometimes to get it on. You know on people's dockets to make sure that people are paying attention to it and to really you know, light fires under people does not mean that you know the that the proposition that we're supporting is going to happen overnight or even within the next month, but that people start to think about it in a really thoughtful, an active way, and so you know with January 3rd coming up. I can very easily see you know, city leaders saying oh well, you know we have to you, know reevaluate and do all of this and that when they really should be evaluating it right now, you know too many people, and you know the life of an artist is already in flux in normal times and so to not have direction or support in any way puts that even more in so just thought about. You know how you could start that conversation and really get that on and even thinking about ways how you know anyone who's part of the production needs to be checked for, like very similar to other industries to be checked for their temperature before they arrive or check before they perform anything like that, and anyone who you know shows any type of symptoms should not be coming in. You know stuff like that, can be thought out. You know more in- depth and more specifically, but just thinking about how we can get this conversation, because for me that article in June I was like that's the last time. We really had anything substantive about this and agreed again that you know. Obviously the big difference is between broadway and movie theaters, but I thought, if we're talking about one, we should be talking about the other as well seema, I see your hand up yeah I mean I think I agree with you that I think this presents an opportunity for us to raise. You know the proverbial alarm that this should be something you know on people's radars, but I just do not think that having a strategy to open it up is frankly enough- and I know that there was some federal legislation around you know, saving our stages. I think it was what it was called around: cult, arts and culture that might have been state. I forget if it was state or federal, but I think that this really presents an opportunity for us to think about like bailout strategies for the industry wholesale as opposed to just kind of one- off like let's just you know, talk about reopening or whatever, because, like that's frankly, not enough it'll be DEC. You know, it'll be a very long time, if not a couple years before, where you know the industry's financially in a good place. So what's the strategy longer term cash flow strategy there instead yeah Paige go ahead. Thank God there's two things. There was an article in timeout. I think it said it was the beginning of September that mentioned that a broadway theater you could reserve tickets for 2021.. They do not suggest you because you'll probably be disappointed because, as it was brought out before a lot of the shows are not reopening. So it's a very hard thing to open a broadway theater, because they do not know whether they're going to have a play. They do not know what kind of an audience they're going to have. It's that's a whole different thing than a movie theater. I think it's good that the movie theaters are reopening, but not the Broadway theater needs money from the federal government and from the state government and even from the city corporates. If there's any money left and it's a shame, but a lot of things are being ignored that are very important, but Jurors New Jersey's governor has set up some kind of attacks on people for that they, the community, is going on in the future that there will be money for the arts and that's what we should do here that like that, would cover any kind of catastrophe like this. I'm too all right. Thank you yeah. So what I'm hearing is? We can take two different approaches to this. I think there's one where we can talk about movie theaters reopening at limited capacity, and we can easily support that and create. You know some suggestions about how that can be done, which is relatively easy and the other more ambitious one is about Broadway Theater, and I mean you know yeah. Obviously, at the end of the day, this is a is a money issue, so I think what we could do is because I think, at the end of the day, you know this can kind of be like a soccer ball that gets kicked around by every elected official to say, oh well, we need bailout money and then that just keeps being pushed forth. I think what we can do is very similar to what we talked about with indoor dining is to request the state and the city to have a very thoughtful and comprehensive plan about the reopening of broadway and a transparency in that process presented to the city by the end of October November December. I do not know what you know kind of date. We want to give on that, but I think that's something that makes more sense, because I think right now, everybody everywhere in the country is saying we need bailout money from the federal government and that may not be the best or you know, there's we do not need to be repetitive and redundant in. You know our resolutions on that, because that's already being asked for, but I think what can be asked for, which is what we're not seeing is direction and transparency with a lot of these plans. So I think particularly with Broadway reopening is that you know back over the summer or before the summer. Rather there was just kind of like okay. This date was thrown out for reopening and nothing has really been said about it until you know something hits the fan and we have to address it and be reactive to it, but I think it's an opportunity for us to be proactive and really demanding from our elected officials and whoever else they need to be reaching out to to create a really thoughtful plan about reopening and getting broadway back on track, because you know it's very important. The arts, not only for you, know the economics of New York City, but also for the personality and culture of it as well. So I know people would be supportive of that as a alternative. What are people's thoughts on that? This is sema. You know, I think my thoughts on it are. I think, if there's a way to kind of combine both strategies like in the in the short term, to ask for transparency around reopening, but then to kind of really demand legislation around bailing out the industry in general. I think that I'd be open to that. I do not think that it is. It hurts to just kind of jump on the bandwagon, as you say of you know, asking for federal funds because, like honestly, that's what's needed and I'd rather go on record saying that we pushed for it fair enough. What do other people think could you could you actually go more into specifics of what a potential resolution like that could look like? Would it just be? You know we want. You know the industry to build out, but could you just flush it out a little bit more yeah? I mean, I think what I'd say. I think what I'd say is. Maybe we'd have a presentation by the Broadway League I that it's the entity that's referenced in the article that you sent Kyle, I'm forgetting the name of the organization. I think it's called the Broadway League or something like that represents 42 stages, acrosss the city. You know I'd, ask them for kind of like a real dollars and cents thing, but to say you know: they're 42, active theaters or active stages in New, York City. They represent the broadway industry that represents x. You know million dollars in New, York, City's growth or you know, New York, City's, economy and, like kind of you know, come up with a clever way to actually like put an a dollar figure. Next to how much we're asking you know for from either federal or state appropriations, I mean, obviously that just goes back to federal, around saving the industry. Okay Genie in yesterday's New York times there a there was one piece on theater in New, York, City and there's some interesting data that if you want to tie that to a resolution that just shows the significance of the arts and performing arts in New York City. So I think that the name of the article is called. I have it up now one last weekend and it tells the stories of actors and what they're doing during the pandemic, but it's indispersed with some data so, for example, before the pandemic, New York state arts and cultural sector contributed 120 billion to New, York's economy or 7.5 percent of the state's economic output. So all that is lost revenue to the state. So I just by ignoring the theaters and just letting them shut down and go away. It's going that this has a long- term effect on the over overall revenue receipts coming into the state. In the city, there were 120,280 000 jobs before the pandemic and 153 of those 153,000 of those have now since disappeared. So it's also the burden of unemployed people. So that's something I again, as I said earlier, all of this and you know January and February is right around the corner. This is going to be with us all the way through next year, most likely with and without a vaccine, I'm looking in the long term and we really going to jump on the bandwagon, as you said, Kyle, maybe ahead of everyone else, because there's going to be a big battle for dollars as they get down the road right now, everybody's just kind of holding on and everybody's helping out. But if we get into a depression- era, economy everybody's going to be battling for those dollars, and so I think at this point the squeaky of the wheel, maybe we'll get the grease that much. You know sooner. Okay, yeah I'm for that, the stronger the better. How does everyone else feel about that? Is there a motion to support such a resolution? Remember please. Okay, so Susan is making a motion to support such a resolution. Is there a second from anyone I'll? Second, it all right was that Kevin sorry, I thought I had. I sorry I thought I had presented that we should like just ask the Broadway League. What are we going to write in the resolution so similar to what you just asked about, which was that we specifically spell out that that there should be because obviously, there's data on this- that we're requesting our elected officials to provide you know economic support to bailout to the broadway industry to the some of whatever it is. I think it's. What was it in the article that was foreign yeah? That was for yeah, I mean we do not. I do not know if we know New York City numbers. Okay. Well, we can add the numbers in, but are we comfortable supporting a resolution? That's making those requests. Yes, are you? Are you comfortable or well yeah? I mean I guess. I just do not have the information, but I mean I'm comfortable with the idea of it. Okay, yeah I mean we can. We can just remember with you know, with the way resolutions go. We obviously have you know talked about it and researched it, and it's just about putting in the specific numbers where that data is available. So we can put that in a final resolution at the end, but it's really about the idea of supporting it and the proposition you made in the first place, which was about being more specific about bailing them out, rather than just a process. Now we're talking specifically broadway right, we're talking specifically yeah, specifically broadway, correct, specifically broadway, yes and I'll, bring up the movie theater. Excuse me: is it just broadway? I thought we were talking movie theaters as well, so the conversation was about both right, but there were two different propositions that you know I pulled apart. So the first that we're talking about right now is the broadway bailout and the second one which I'll bring up after this, because then someone can make a motion about it because it would be a separate resolution is about reopening movie theaters at limited capacity in a safe way. Try Kyle meant to suggest one other thing sure go ahead, because there is, it seems to be a lack of transparency or anything in the news about what's going on, I'm sure in the Broadway sector. Maybe you know the producers and all that there's millions of conversations happening behind the scenes. But you know you did some due diligence before this meeting and you really could not find one. So maybe we could put that in a resolution that community board six is looking for some more transparency and what they're, what their you know, future plans for it for entertainment or for Broadway, because there's nothing that we know. I mean we do not. You know we're trying to figure out what's going on, but we can't find anything. So maybe we should ask the mayor's office to come. You know someone should come to. Maybe our board meeting to present you know what are your plans? No, absolutely yeah! That's amazing! Why are we we're talking about Broadway, we're talking about movie theaters, comedy clubs and other performance houses? Why are they left out because of their size, or I maybe I'm not clear on water, so you're talking about Broadway compared to off to other theaters comedy houses, other performance houses, there's one in Murray, Hill, there's so yeah, so with Broadway, I'm assuming it's just the arts in New, York City, so any performance based theater. I think we're just grouping under broadway, but we can spell that out more specifically to a resolution. Great that's good to hear, I think, broadway. I think that the definition of you know x, number of minimum, specifically just rather okay. Yes, sorry, that was my mistake. I should have organized that better sorry about that. Are there any other comments about this? I think Paige has something. Yes, I do. Oh sorry, well, Paige you got to raise your hand on zoom. I can't I had it raised. I could not get it up on the screen. No, you have to put it on zoom because I can't see it. I know it was not working. It was not working. Okay, so put it in the chat page. I told you could have you put in the chat but go ahead and speak Ryan lafferty is supposedly at this meeting. He is with the borough president's office. Can he find us some data he's our representative about the theaters and, what's going on sure yeah I mean cody. Can we let Brian speak if Brian would like to speak? If he has any information, can you hear me? Oh yeah, I can hear you great thanks cody and thanks Kyle and Paige. I do not have information at my fingertips, but I'd be happy to reach out to the Broadway League, certainly to get some more in- depth, information and statistics. That would be relevant awesome. Thank you, my pleasure right. So just as a reminder, we did have a motion to support a resolution to bail out, let's call it performance or arts in New York City performance arts in New, York City that was seconded by Kevin. So let's take a vote on it. Now cody, can you lead the vote? Okay committee members I'll call your name, and you just declare your vote in favor against abstain, not entitled Kyle. A third I'm in support, Matt Bondi Matt. Okay, Genie did not for you in favor, Charles, Fernandez or paige judge in Favor, Yusuf, Khalid, Yusef, he's muted yourself, yourself, hello. Your vote on the resolution. I'm voting in favor sorry got it. John Keller in Favor, Kevin O'keefe in favor, see Michelle in Favor Susan Steinberg in favor return to Matt Bondi. Are you there? Okay, we do not have a vote for Matt, but we've got nine in favor and no none against no abstentions. No, not entitled votes. Thank you! So much and and female I'll send you a draft or if you would like to lead it or work together on it. I think that'd be great and janie. If you'd like to be part of that too. Just let me know I think yeah it'd be great to have your input on that too, and I think it'd also be great to invite the Broadway League at our next meeting to hear more about. What's going on with them, and you know what kind of needs they have as well, so the other part of this was the movie theater. So one of the ideas we were discussing was reopening movie theaters at a limited capacity very similar to a restaurant. Is there a motion to support that, or is there any more conversation or comments that you'd like to have on that as well? I'd support that I mean I'm. I would move that if that's some emotion, so you can move it are you? Are you making an emotion, I'm making a motion all right, all right so motion by John seconded by Paige and we'll take a vote on it on that cody and just as a reminder for everyone. It is about reopening movie theaters, so these are like the amc's or your local, like east village theaters at limited capacity, while maintaining you know obviously proper health guidelines, all right, kyle. Your vote, favor Matt, Bondy Jeannie D'onofrio in favor, Charles Fernandez in favor, page judge in favor, Yousef Khalid, Yousef, John Keller in Favor, Kevin O'keefe in favor, see Michelle in Favor, Susan Steinberg in favor. All right, Matt, Bondi or Yousef Khalid, that's eight in favor, zero against zero abstention; zero, not entitled haptic. Thank you all right. Okay, so I'll move on to my chairs report, we're done with the business on the agenda. I do not have a major report. There are a couple of things that I'd like to bring to notice, which are be working again with cba on some webinars to support businesses about reopening and everything that's going on, so we're currently in formation on that. Second thing is: I do not know if anyone saw this, but there was legislation passed the other week on Covid-19 charges, Covid-19 surcharges- I do not know if anyone saw that, so that was actually passed, that businesses can add a certain charge during Covid-19 to make up for their. You know, PPE or whatever other situations they're going through, but what I thought was most interesting about. It was somebody listened to a resolution which was about consumer protection and it was very explicitly written in that any Covid-19 surcharge must be expressed to the customer prior to the purchase of the good or service. So I just want to applaud everyone on the committee for their great work on that, and particularly Susan and youssef, who wrote that resolution. I think it's wonderful and again, this goes back to you know what I try to hit home. Every time is like it's really great to be proactive, because then we get to dictate what gets legislated and what gets added to that. So I just really want to applaud everyone on that and that's really wonderful to see. So that's basically all I have for chair's report. I do have some new business and then I'll open it up to anyone on the committee or the public would like to bring an older new business, but the only new business I have is that for this meeting, I'd actually been reaching out to something called Decrim Ny, and I do not know if anyone is familiar with that dcrim ny is a advocacy organization, that's working on decriminalizing and incarcerating and de- stigmatizing, the sex trades in the New, York City and New York state area, as many people know, there's a lot of first of all, trafficking that goes on there. A lot of health issues, violence just a whole lot of things going on in this particular industry- was particularly hit by Covid-19. As you can imagine, there were a lot of people who were not able to get. You know certain benefits, because their job was not viewed as a job or were not able to get employment, and so I wanted to invite them to our meeting to present on the work that they're doing. There was a couple pieces of legislation that were introduced in 2019. cody. Can you go to the I believe? It's the advocacy section that was passed that was introduced by Senator Salazar as well as Senator Hoylman, and I believe assembly member got yeah gottfried as well, which I thought were very important. I'm not sure where all of that went so the first one as you can see, is about stop violence and the sex trades act. The second one which was introduced by Senator Hulman, was about walking while trans and then can you scroll down cody to the last one, or is it only two or no there's three yeah record relief? So these are the big pieces of legislation that were introduced in 2019. I thought it was worthwhile for us to be focusing on this, because at the end of the day, this is an industry of people who do need support from the communities and their government and do not have anything on the books, and so I thought it would be great to start that conversation with them as well, and I know that there are a lot of preconceived notions about it. I know it's a very taboo subject to talk about, but I wanted to get the conversation started. They were not able to join us for this meeting, but I would like to have it set for our meeting in October, so I'll send a primer about this as well, so that everyone can read up about it and you know be educated about the issues and everything that they're specifically focusing on as well. So I just wanted to keep everyone apprised of that. John is your hand up yeah. I know I mean I want to get bored for him, but this is something I tend to be very supportive of mainly because of you know the dangers of risks of sex trafficking, especially the minors that the more we get this in the open. You know the better, but I I'm open to I'd like to people that are informed, oh yeah for sure yeah. This is all about. This is definitely something that's going to take more than one meeting to discuss, and I would like to invite members of the public as well, because, obviously this is a very charged subject, but we need to get the conversation started and I think it'd be great to hear from advocates particularly about pieces of legislation that I think a lot of people could agree on, because I think a lot of times when the subject gets brought up. It's about legalizing sex work and people do not really know what that means and have a lot of preconceived notions about it. But do not understand that even within that there are issues, particularly around trafficking, there's also language access issues, because also the people who to be sexually trafficked are people who are underage, but also from another country who speak another non- english language. So there are a lot of issues. I've worked on some of this personally in my professional life with trafficking. So I just I want to get this. The conversation started because I think this is something again that we can be proactive on. There are things that are already in existence that we can be supportive of if we choose to be and just again to start that conversation, because I think this is something that's going to really pop up and we should really be on the forefront of it and yeah, so just keeping that on everyone's radar. So with that are there is there any other old or new business that anyone would like to bring up any subject areas that people would like to discuss pages to your hands up. Thank you. Yes, I wanted to tell you yesterday I received in the mail it looked like an invitation. It was from Igc Hospitality New, York City. When I opened it, I was thinking I was being invited to something it said. Thank you and it said dear Paige, the delivery orders made a difference. Who would take this opportunity to thank you for the kind expression of the supporters to our restaurants during a very difficult time. We appreciate your efforts and we are in a better place because of you. We are grateful for your loyalty and look forward to being able to serve you in the future and then on the back. It says. Thank you. I really I mean I was astonished that anybody even appreciated the little that I did. I mean I ordered out a lot I mean, but I was not spending hundreds of dollars. Well, I did order out a lot. It was not a stimulus check yeah, my kids should get medals for that, and let me just say one thing: I went out for the first time on Friday and again on Monday one to the doctor went to get my flu shot because my doctor was out of the flu shot. I went to a restaurant, that's acrosss the street from Kyle, it's a it's a par. It's a pub excuse me. I went to this place. He was smart enough in the beginning to rent three backyards. I mean his backyard and two others, so he has all that open space, but was he also during the winter, and I do not know what he heats it with? He puts up a tent over those three backyards and you can eat out there, which is very fascinating to be find out how he heats that you know I've been there on a very cold day. Actually I there's only one room: that's inside unless you go yeah I mean yeah. There are a multitude of ways to heat up spaces. I think with the legislation that was discussed at the top of the meeting, it's just an additional option. If people choose to use that they would because it's currently outlawed, they would have that legal option to do so. Yeah. There are a number of ways. Some people do not even need heating mechanisms, it's all about insulation, so there are ways to do that as well. But that's a that's a great observation. Paige thanks for is that tubbles that you're talking about? Yes, it is awesome all right. Are there any other comments or observations or sharebacks that anyone would like to make before we move on all right sing, none you're very lucky. Today, I'm adjourning the meeting at 7:43 P.M thanks Kyle. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.
