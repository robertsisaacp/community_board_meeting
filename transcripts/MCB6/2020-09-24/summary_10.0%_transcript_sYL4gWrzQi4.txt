We will be having a discussion on indoor dining and extending outdoor dining, we'll then transition into a conversation on reopening broadway and movie theaters, and then just you know, housekeeping chairs report and older new business.
That, was when the governor announced that they would be allowing indoor dining at 25, capacity, obviously up to 50, and so I wanted to put the conversation on hold until our committee meeting this time.
So I sent out a couple of these articles they're up on our screen, but I just want to open it up for initial comments and thoughts from the committee on what they're hearing, what they're, thinking You know.
Kind of you know still creates the same problem to be the economic problem, rather to begin with, which is that the businesses aren't able to genera generate enough revenue to pay the bills, and so from this article can see that nine out of every 10 restaurants and bars in new york city can't pay full rent right.
As, I'm, sure, everyone, saw, there's been a lot of articles of operators and even workers saying that they don't feel comfortable with indoor dining, even if it is allowed, because they're just not sure, what's going on with public health, and you know a possible second wave of this going on Is we've seen outdoor dining, work.
Everyone is kind of decorated as their own way, they've put up their own stuff, and it's really cool to see that I think it's kind of harking us back to pre-k new york city, where people are showing their personalities, their vibes, and I.
If restaurants can figure out a way to make that comfortable in colder weather in inclement, weather, I say: go for it, and if people want to eat out there and drink out, there, I think they should have that right to do.
What kind of margin a mid-range restaurant where you could go out and get an option, you're saying like what would the minimum be You know regular business they're in trouble, so So that so that's the concern, here.
I saw an article somewhere in new york city of some restaurant using this method, but they had those bubbles, like those plastic bubbles that people could sit inside.
So the bill also stipulates that outdoor propane heaters, which new york city restaurants, currently can't use, would be legalized to facilitate outdoor dining in the winter.
So we had put a resolution together, which we all voted in the affirmative on to have the city put together a plan by September 30th that you know established a transparent process and where they were at in their own processes, and discussions on indoor dining and reopening up restaurants.
We wanted to talk about first of all, indoor dining about the 25 to 50 percent, because first of all, even the restaurants themselves, aren't necessarily comfortable open reopening up with indoor dining because of health concerns same with the employees, they're, also afraid of hiring people for indoor dining and then having some second wave come across and then having to re-close again and then having to fire people.
There are a lot of conversations about extending outdoor dining throughout the year, so it wouldn't expire on October 31st, but restaurants would have that option to continue into the cold months as well, and part of the legislation.
I did remind people that on September 30th there is a hearing on this proposed legislation, but of course, because it's still in formation Essentially there's a lot of opportunity for us to really lay out the things that we'd want to see in any extended outdoor, dining, and So. One of a couple of the things that I mentioned as an example, are that we could, you know, require them to to remove all outdoor dining in the cases of inclement weather.
If it's a month, you know that's another month that they can make people comfortable, yeah, November , say that they have 365 days that they can utilize outdoor dining for which includes in the depths of January and February, businesses aren't going to put out tables and chairs if no one's showing up to that right.
This is new york city that I'm sure that there are enough people who would do that And if they're willing to you know, support a restaurant in that way, I think I think it's all about having the option to do it, rather than assuming that everyone would be using outdoor dining, space.
You know if you're, using qualico or plexiglas, or something like that to enclose the space to keep it insulated is an option that they can use, but some people might want to use propane Does.
The wayside in the last couple of months, has been broadway, theaters and movie theaters and at the time it made a lot of sense, obviously with capacity and everything like that, but as we're opening reopening a lot of things, particularly with restaurants, at a limited capacity.
You know you've, probably done it through an app or online, where you can pick your seat so thinking about limited capacity and how you know, theaters, whether it be broadway or movie, could black out seats to make sure that capacity is limited, but also that people aren't sitting.
You know on people's dockets to make sure that people are paying attention to it and to really you know, light fires under people doesn't mean that you know the that the proposition that we're supporting is going to happen overnight or even within the next month, but that people start to think about it in a really thoughtful, an active way, and so you know, with January 3rd coming up.
You know more in-depth and more specifically, but just thinking about how we can get this conversation, because for me that article in June Obviously, the big difference is between broadway and movie theaters, but I thought.
I forget if it was state or federal, but I think that this really presents an opportunity for us to think about like bailout strategies for the industry wholesale as opposed to just kind of one-off, like let's just you know, talk about reopening or whatever , I think it said it was the beginning of September that mentioned that a broadway theater you could reserve tickets for 2021.
I think it's good that the movie theaters are reopening, but not the broadway theater needs money from the federal government and from the state government and even from the city, corporates.
The community, is going on in the future that there will be money for the arts, I think there's one where we can talk about movie, theaters reopening at limited capacity, and we can easily support that and create.
We need bailout money And I think what we can do is very similar to what we talked about with indoor dining Is, to request the state and the city to have a very thoughtful and comprehensive plan about the reopening of broadway and a transparency in that process presented to the city by the end of October.
You know, I'd ask them for kind of like a real dollars and cents thing, but to say you know, they're, 42, active theaters or active stages in new york, city.
Is there, a second from anyone Are we going to write in the resolution so similar to what you just asked about, which was that we specifically spell out that that there should be because obviously there's data on this- that we're requesting our elected officials to provide you know economic support to bailout to the broadway industry to the some of whatever it is.
I thought we were talking movie theaters as well, so the conversation was about both right, but there were two different propositions that you know: So, the first that we're talking about right now is the broadway bailout and the second one which I'll bring up after this, because then someone can make a motion about it because it would be a separate resolution is about reopening movie theaters at limited capacity in a safe, way.
You know the better, but I I'm, open to I'd like to people that are informed , This is definitely something that's gonna take more than one meeting to discuss, and I would like to invite members of the public as well, Obviously this is a very charged subject, but we need to get the conversation started.
