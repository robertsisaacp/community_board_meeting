So tonight's agenda is one, is a update on temporary housing and services for homeless, new yorkers due to Covid-19 19.
Have some humor in this during these boring procedural things update on temporary housing and services for homeless, new yorkers due to Covid-19 19, including in the use of temporary hotel sites in cd6.
Also mention that a lot of families double up and the estimate of actual homeless students in the public schools in new york go Cd6 is home to four permanent shelters.
This effort was previously spearheaded by the NYPD So lines of communication, cb6 and local stakeholders are in constant discussion with DHS temporary shelters, site operations, our partners in city and state government and our neighbors to identify and address both the quality of life concerns that our house residents have and the concerns that are unhoused and street homeless residents.
We have heard so many times now that there's some real issues with the lack of available public restrooms Long-Term solution is that we, as a community board, will ask for the city to start funding.
There are 60 000 people in our shelter system, over twenty thousand of them children and now a hundred thousand new york city, public school students who live in temporary housing.
Many of us can feel a bit helpless in being able to aid these individuals in our community, but we're certainly trying I'm sure councilmember powers will mention the harmonia and kind of that groundswell of support.
I think what new yorkers want to see, which is actual supportive, housing.
I do have a couple of supportive housing facilities, but not nearly enough, because those wraparound services are so critical to making sure that the chronic homelessness that happens, that recidivism doesn't continue.
My office is working with the department of homeland services street outreach, teams, local precincts and service providers to ensure that homeless, new yorkers are connected to life-saving resources.
We did that with one of our local facilities, making sure that substance abuse treatment program was actually available on site because some people were, you, know, drinking and smoking in front, and we did receive a couple of concerns from some of our neighbors and certainly an end to discriminatory criminal justice practices that leave people.
I. Think, what's the best part about this particular building is not only are there truly affordable units at amis at like 60, but there will be units set aside for formerly homeless families so trying to put that into practice and multiple sites in my district and really get those numbers, up, and so I realize again can be kind of frustrating in terms of some of the answers that we get from our city, agencies.
Of, get to leave there, but still viewed it as really kind of essential to their lives, and it was where many had their doctors, nearby or Some Were had other critical services around there, and it was, What I, would say, is sort of a political game here in the city We're going to be able to continue to provide that as their as their home as long as they need it.
Also mention, like think about the public schools in the area or other places where there are families that who are experiencing homelessness and also need whether it's school supplies or could use any other assistance.
This is so much have tied into our strategy around housing here in the city and both the ability in areas like ours, which are become more difficult to identify places to build the type of affordable housing that we need in the city to be affordable for folks actually to live in, but also we need to break down some of the exhibitions from the existing barriers to finding housing for those who can- I have a bill: that's about source of income discrimination, which typically represents itself, as if you have a voucher.
Using we're trying to basically expand that law here in new york city to give people who have an opportunity to get housing to me to not show up and find out that they can't get housing, whereas they desperately need it.
I know that these can sometimes become difficult issues in our in any community, but it is, you know, incumbent on us to all try our best here to help our fellow new yorkers and try to find ways to make this a long-term strategy for our city and avoid these sort of big contentious.
3-1-1 is where you would report it and again you can call our office or your council member's office as well, and we either the community board office or the council member's office would then definitely follow up with any kind of service provider in the area and make sure that something someone is coming out, and this When we're talking about street outreach teams.
Last and when they're gonna be able to move their people back into their home, And look, I think that for a lot for the city, the aspiration is to eventually get back into the shelters which are really places intended to be centralized.
The city continues to invest in costly, temporary solutions, while under investing in long-term systemic solutions, the structural shortage of affordable housing, the under supply of supportive housing and social support services and the urgent relocations for health and safety reasons forced by the covent emergency taken together.
First, just to kind of talk a little bit about the portfolio that I ever see and in terms of the different programs I street to home Manhattan, which is the outreach provider for midtown.
I, also oversee two senior supportive housing residents in Brooklyn for homeless and low-income seniors, and then I also have a portfolio of programs that involves fee-for-service contracted programs, primarily outreach at this point, so we're working with macy's and grand central partnership in that capacity.
We are calling it light touch services, I'm, not sure, if that's the official title, but where we will work with individuals and families for generally the duration of about a year, just to ensure that they have the support and resources that they need really to be able to sustain their housing at such time that we would step back out of the picture.
That's sort of the overview of the things that are in my portfolio, which I really love, because it's a nice, diverse range of resources and programs, souped nuts, from individuals on the street, to you know being housed in a variety of different settings.
The city did not provide wrap-around services, nor did they provide on-site on security, and for that reason my quality of life was being challenged, and I actually was a housing specialist, so I had, I understood the difficulty in placing people, while my building was a shelter, Sort of like you know like inception kind of situation, and that just goes to show that it takes a community.
I mean we had hundreds of bags of food and within an hour everything was gone, and If that's not telling you what kind of situation people are in right now, And I think that's what midtown community court does I'm really grateful for the social workers that we have and what they've been able to do remotely for so long in an impossible situation and maintaining contact with folks to try and prevent people from overdosing?.
This has been an inc we've seen an increase in anxiety, depression, people who were formerly clients of midtown community court who had finished their mandates were reaching out to our clinical folks to re-engage with services voluntarily because they felt like they were isolated and needed to have support.
So people don't have to continue to get rearrested for petty crimes, and you know we're also trying to figure out a way to connect with supportive housing for folks who would be able to participate in this program.
We're calling it tentatively the midtown rapid engagement program, and so if we can provide the peer navigator, the social worker, housing phones to folks, we create a dynamic in which they can become successful and we have to create a web of services to make that happen in our community.
So I'm, going to talk a little bit about safer consumption spaces and the need for people who use drugs to be kept safe and alive in the midst of this pandemic, but also just to acknowledge that we remain in an overdose crisis that never really went away.
So having access to a space like this, where there are folks on hand and on staff who can monitor, you can help provide the safer context that people need and what we know is that not only do they reduce overdose deaths on site where the consumption occurs, they also have a ripple effect of reducing overdose, deaths.
Rates, studies of safer consumption spaces across the world have shown that new people do not come to these sites to start injecting drugs.
Any, sort of drug-related offenses, trafficking, assault or robbery rates in these communities, because again, when people have a safe space to go, they go inside, they take care of business So what we find is that, having that place to be can often give them a linkage to care and to support, and what we find is that it improves public order through reductions in public injection.
Collectively our members operate about 55 000 units of supportive housing with about 35 000 of those units in new york, city alone.
So there's actually three new york, new york, models, new york, new york, one two and three, and that was a combination of the city and state working together to develop supportive housing.
So one building, different apartments, social services on site case managers on site, security, on site maintenance on site, and then there is another model of supportive housing which is called scattered site and to bring it back a little bit to what council member powers discussed with the source of income.
There is some difficulty like passing that legislation is going to be extremely important, statewide and city-wide to ensure that people have vouchers that cover market rent apartments, because that is really another reason that makes it difficult for people to exit out of the homeless, shelter system, particularly families with children, because it's hard to find affordable units that will accept the voucher without discrimination.
All of our legislature at the city, state and federal level can help us do, but you particularly, is to help us identify sites within your communities that will allow us to develop supportive, housing.
You, know, 35 000 families in shelter, 55, 000 people in new york, city.
It's heartbreaking, and there are you- know five eligible people trying to exit the homeless shelter system for each one vacancy in supportive, housing.
You see things, try to refrain from calling 9-1-1 use new york city, Well, instead, I, think that will help to not traumatize our people that are unsheltered and living on the street and provide you with an additional resource.
As more housing stock comes online, it will continue to be an issue And I think, allowing for some agility around that would not only free up spaces throughout the continuum, but it will allow people to be getting their needs met in the settings where they you know, would be getting the adequate kind of match to support as their needs change and they often age in the community.
Does the city spend to house homeless, new yorkers in these temporary shelter situations?
A lot of folks don't realize that new york city is a right to shelter, city and, with that being the case, there's, always funds and money allocated and set aside to accommodate and provide services.
The fact that the city has a mandate to shelter and house new yorkers in need, so that so that money is already set aside.
I would say, probably most commonly the reason why we hear about folks, you know being reluctant to go into shelter, again, though, just to kind of take a step back within the street homeless, population.
Thankfully, in our work, so One of our community members asked whether it might be possible to put an effort together to deploy some mobile toilet and shower vehicles in new york to provide basic comfort and hygiene services to the large street population.
