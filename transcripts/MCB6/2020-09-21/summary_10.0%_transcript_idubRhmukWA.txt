So tonight's agenda is one, is a update on temporary housing and services for homeless, new yorkers due to Covid-19., including let's go back in the bathroom.
Have some humor in this during these boring procedural things update on temporary housing and services for homeless, new yorkers due to Covid-19, including in the use of temporary hotel sites in cd6.
This effort was previously spearheaded by the NYPD So lines of communication, CB6 and local stakeholders are in constant discussion with DHS temporary shelters, site operations, our partners in city and state government and our neighbors to identify and address both the quality of life concerns that our house residents have and the concerns that are unhoused and street homeless residents.
We have heard so many times now that there's some real issues with the lack of available public restrooms, Long- Term solution is that we, as a community board, will ask for the city to start funding.
I just want to thank all the members of Community Board sick, the sakes, the public, the everyone who organized the panel, the speakers I know our city is in the midst of an extended housing crisis that has been exacerbated by the copa pandemic and even before Covid-19.
There are 60,000 people in our shelter system, over twenty thousand of them children and now a hundred thousand New York City Public school students who live in temporary housing.
Many of us can feel a bit helpless in being able to aid these individuals in our community, but we're certainly trying I'm sure Councilmember powers will mention the harmonia and kind of that groundswell of support.
I. Think what new yorkers want to see, which is actual supportive, housing.
I do have a couple of supportive housing facilities, but not nearly enough, because those wraparound services are so critical to making sure that the chronic homelessness that happens, that recidivism does not continue, because there's someone there to kind of talk to and make sure that you have what you need.
But my office is working with the Department of Homeland Services Street, outreach, teams, local precincts and service providers to ensure that homeless, new yorkers are connected to life-.
We did that with one of our local facilities, making sure that substance abuse treatment program was actually available on site because some people were, you, know, drinking and smoking in front, and we did receive a couple of concerns from some of our neighbors and certainly an end to discriminatory criminal justice practices that leave people.
And I'm, going to continue calling on the mayor to provide concrete details on the future of housing for new Yorkers experiencing homelessness.
I. Think, what's the best part about this particular building is not only are there truly affordable units at Amis at like 60, but there will be units set aside for formerly homeless families so trying to put that into practice and multiple sites in my district and really get those numbers, up, and so I realize again can be kind of frustrating in terms of some of the answers that we get from our city, agencies.
Also mention, like think about the public schools in the area or other places where there are families that who are experiencing homelessness and also need whether it's school supplies or could use any other assistance, it.
This is so much have tied into our strategy around housing here in the city and both the ability in areas like ours, which are become more difficult to identify places to build the type of affordable housing that we need in the city to be affordable for folks actually to live in, but also we need to break down some of the exhibitions from the existing barriers to finding housing for those who can- I have a bill: that's about source of income discrimination, which typically represents itself, as if you have a voucher, a landlord can discriminate against you and not give you an apartment, even though you might be eligible for it, based on the source of income for that you're, using we're trying to basically expand that law here in New York City, to give people who have an opportunity to get housing to me to not show up and find out that they can't get housing, whereas they desperately need it.
Rather, has a bill to expand the vouchers here in the city, which is a the you know, ability for you to go, get housing, But, they're, critically, underfunded, right, now, meaning that folks are spending years.
I know that these can sometimes become difficult issues in our in any community, but it is, you know, incumbent on us to all try our best here to help our fellow new Yorkers and try to find ways to make this a long- term strategy for our city and avoid these sort of big contentious.
Is the primary intake for homeless men in New, York City, and this member of the public notes that there are safety concerns associated with this and wonders why we can't spread out intake whole, not through other parts of the city, and You know that it creates a concentration of concern in the high 20s and low 30s, I'm, the Manhattan board director for the Department of social services and under the umbrella of DSS lives, hra and DHS.
3- 1- 1 is where you would report it and again you can call our office or your council member's office as well, and we either the Community, Board, Office or the council member's office would then definitely follow up with any kind of service provider in the area and make sure that something someone is coming out, and this When we're talking about street outreach teams.
The city continues to invest in costly, temporary solutions, while under investing in long- term systemic solutions, the structural shortage of affordable housing, the under supply of supportive housing and social support services and the urgent relocations for health and safety reasons forced by the covent emergency taken.
It's one of the connected to one of the things that one of the council members spoke about earlier in terms of the new housing developments that, when they're bringing on a homeless, set- aside, they will contract with a provider to provide.
We are calling it light, touch services, I'm, not sure, if that's the official title, but where we will work with individuals and families for generally the duration of about a year, just to ensure that they have the support and resources that they need really to be able to sustain their housing at such time that we would step back out of the picture.
That's sort of the overview of the things that are in my portfolio, which I really love, because it's a nice, diverse range of resources and programs, Soup- Nuts, from individuals on the street, to you know being housed in a variety of different settings.
The city did not provide wrap- around services, nor did they provide on- site on security, and for that reason my quality of life was being challenged, and I actually was a housing specialist.
I mean we had hundreds of bags of food and within an hour everything was gone, and If that's not telling you what kind of situation people are in right now, And I think that's what Midtown community court does I'm really grateful for the social workers that we have and what they've been able to do remotely for so long in an impossible situation and maintaining contact with folks to try and prevent people from overdosing?
This has been an inc we've seen an increase in anxiety, depression, people who were formerly clients of Midtown community court who had finished their mandates were reaching out to our clinical folks to re, engage with services voluntarily because they felt like they were isolated and needed to have support.
People do not have to continue to get rearrested for petty crimes, and you know we're also trying to figure out a way to connect with supportive housing for folks who would be able to participate in this program.
We're calling it tentatively the Midtown rapid engagement, program, and so if we can provide the peer navigator, the social worker, housing phones to folks, we create a dynamic in which they can become successful and we have to create a web of services to make that happen in our community.
Think it's especially since we were talking about kind of like petty crimes and people trying not to re- lap in drug use.
So I'm going to talk a little bit about safer consumption spaces and the need for people who use drugs to be kept safe and alive in the midst of this pandemic, but also just to acknowledge that we remain in an overdose crisis that never really went away.
So having access to a space like this, where there are folks on hand and on staff who can monitor, you can help provide the safer context that people need and what we know is that not only do they reduce overdose deaths on site where the consumption occurs, they also have a ripple effect of reducing overdose deaths in those neighborhoods and communities.
Ask if you want to get connected to other services, help, make some phone calls to the nearest housing project or shelter.
Rates, studies of safer consumption spaces acrosss the world have shown that new people do not come to these sites to start injecting drugs.
Our members operate about 55,000 units of supportive housing with about 35,000 of those units in New, York, City, alone.
So, there's actually, three New York New York, Models, New, York, New York, one two and three, and that was a combination of the city and state working together to develop supportive housing.
So one building, different apartments, social services on site case managers on site, security, on site maintenance on site, and then there is another model of supportive housing which is called scattered site and to bring it back a little bit to what council member powers discussed with the source of income.
There is some difficulty like passing that legislation is going to be extremely important, statewide and city- wide to ensure that people have vouchers that cover market rent apartments, because that is really another reason that makes it difficult for people to exit out of the homeless, shelter system, particularly families with children, because it's hard to find affordable units that will accept the voucher without discrimination.
I, think to all of these ills is the development of supportive housing and one of the things that you all as a community can do.
All of our legislature at the city, state and federal level, can help us do, but you particularly, is to help us identify sites within your communities that will allow us to develop supportive, housing.
You know 35,000 families in shelter, 55,000 people in New, York, City.
It's heartbreaking, and there are you, know five eligible people trying to exit the homeless shelter system for each one vacancy in supportive, housing.
You see things, try to refrain from calling 9, 1, 1, use, New, York, City, Instead, I, think that will help to not traumatize our people that are unsheltered and living on the street and provide you with an additional resource.
And I think, allowing for some agility around that would not only free up spaces throughout the continuum, but it will allow people to be getting their needs met in the settings where they you know, would be getting the adequate kind of match to support as their needs change and they often age in the community.
Does the city spend to House homeless, new Yorkers in these temporary shelter, situations?
A lot of folks do not realize that New York City is a right to shelter, city and, with that being the case, there's, always funds and money allocated and set aside to accommodate and provide services.
Given the fact that the city has a mandate to Shelter and House New Yorkers in need, so that so that money is already set aside.
What we hear as far as the reason why most individuals on the street do not want to come into shelters, probably not going to be surprised to miss the people on the call they will often report feeling, unsafe, and You know I.
I would say, probably most commonly the reason why we hear about folks, you know being reluctant to go into shelter, again, though, just to kind of take a step back within the street homeless, population.
I actually went to Midtown because we were thinking about using Midtown community courts, backyard courtyard space to set up the showers for a day for actually like a month, but a few times a week and also have a porta potty on site for folks in the neighborhood right, now, Midtown had a flood about a month, ago, and so all of our water is turned off.
Can we do as an as a community and as a neighborhood to encourage both the state and the city to invest more money and more priority in building more supportive housing?
The proposal to identify spikes for supportive housing is really important, and I do not know what this committee has done in the past or what the thought process has been around that, but I think our sort of intimate knowledge of the district.
