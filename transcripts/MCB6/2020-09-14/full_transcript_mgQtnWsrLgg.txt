Find us giving them a few seconds to explain. No, that would be fine. That would be fine, all right, hello person calling in by phone last Digits423, and you indicate your hello. Can you hear me? Yes, hello? This is Eva Lasseter, I'm a member of this committee. Can you hear me that in case I want to make a comment sure yeah in case you need to make a comment: just raise your hand as you've done by pressing star six, and we will enable your microphone hi, eva, oh hi. So when you take attendance, I can still stay unmuted to say here. Is that correct? Yes, you can alright. Thank you. Can mute and unmute yourself by pressing Star six all right. Thank you very much and then it's star nine. If you want to raise your hand to try and get Rick's attention so that you can speak on a particular item, all right thanks all right! Thank you! Okay, before we get started I want to. I just want to mention that this is the first time I've done this, I'm going to be relying on the office staff to help me. I'm not sure that I'm going to know how to deal with people waving their hands, but they will. They also have it so one way or the other will get a hold of everybody. It's probably just as well, not to have everybody off mute because we could end up in a free- for- all, but at some point we may, who knows we'll just sort of take it as if it was a regular committee meeting, but I do have the formalities to do as we start off and I'm going to start the meeting now. Let me see where are we going to go? This is the September 14 2020 meeting of Community Board Vi Budget and governmental affairs Committee? My name is Rick Eggers and I am the chair of the committee this it's my first committee meeting and I want to thank Brian Ben Newenhoven for all the work he has done in the past and I'm glad he's staying on the committee to help out our vice chair is rishma Patel. It's now. What time do we have? I think it's 6:36 and let's see we do not have anybody who has volunteered to take minutes. Can I get a volunteer from the committee members? Okay, nobody, volunteers! Oh there, you go oh good, we got gene, we got it. I told you I'm punchy, so they may be interesting minutes for this particular meeting gene. The most important thing is just to note the things that we change as we go through and that'll help a big, a good deal for follow- up afterwards. So if you can help with that, I'm going to be trying to do it myself, but you've taken minutes on many an occasion. You know how to do that. So I'm not going to worry about it. Thank you. We now need to do a roll call. So Jesus, if you could do the roll call, please your thing all right. We will now take attendance by roll call. I will call your name and you will unmute yourselves when your name is called please say present and I will announce if there is a Quorum ava Marie Lasseter present. Thank you, claude L, Winfield President, you Brian venue and hogan present. Thank you. Gene santoro here. Thank you, Karen Moore here. Thank you. Okay, page judge here. Thank you be dismantled here. Thank you, Jim Collins yep. Thank you, reshma Patel here. Thank you and Rick Edgar's here perfect attendance, everyone's here. Okay now and you can't, everybody can't put something on the screen now and walk away. You've all signed in you're all committed now to stick around the agenda for tonight's meeting was distributed ahead of time by the board office and appears now up on the screen. If there's no objection, we will adopt the agenda. As stated. Do I hear any objections? Okay, the agenda is adopted. The minutes from June, 8th and June 10th meetings were distributed ahead of time. If there's a no objection we'll adopt those minutes. If you have an objection to the minutes, you can raise your hand or you can unmute yourself and speak okay, so we now that we have the minutes, have been approved. Okay, so I have some ground rules that I've been given here. No one may speak until granted by the from the floor committee members. If you have a question about committee business and wish to make a motion, please raise your hand through zoom. If you click the participants icon, the participants panel should appear and you should find the raise hand function there. If you still have any technical difficulty, you may click the chat, icon and relay your difficulty. The chat function should not be used for committee business or questions about agenda topics. All such remarks should be made on the record by raising your hand and being called on when a committee member is given the floor to speak, you'll be identified and you're going to mute yourself, so you can speak. We are required by executive order to create a verbatim transcript of the meeting. So please keep your questions and comments, succinct and Jermaine to the discussion now for tonight's agenda. We will start with a public hearing. This is a requirement of the budget process and it gives members of the public a chance to comment on budget requests that they would like to see coming from our board. Are there any members of the public who are here to speak in the public hearing? Okay, I am not seeing any. There do not appear to be any hands raised. Okay, I see 28. I see 28 participants, though curious. It is perfectly fine for people to be listening in and to, but I should tell you that during the business meeting there are only limited opportunities to speak. Unless you, let me know the topic that you want to speak on, so that we can control the length of time of the meeting. Are there people here who are here to speak about a particular topic outside the public meeting? There's a little hand, that's going up, oh and it went away. Oh here's another hand, that's come up from my Miss Diane Grayson one second, hello, Miss Grayson your microphone is enabled hi. Are you able to hear me? Yes, oh wonderful. I hope it's appropriate to ask it's on the topic of education in the district and our district currently has a serious lack of 3-K and pre- k seats. I know this goes more through City, Council and education, but I've spoken to many other constituents in the district and I think it would be a priority to advance the agenda of adding more seats in our district, and I think it is a serious need. I know with Covid-19 and everything it's a challenging time to request it, but there is a real need for more 3-K and pre- k seats for our district, and so I just wanted to raise that. Thank you thank you and just for anyone else who is sitting in that's a perfectly appropriate topic perfectly appropriate question for the public here. So thank you for your contribution. There we'll note that you have asked for more seats in pre- k, we'll see if we what we can do with that great. Thank you so much. Thank you. Is there anyone else who'd like to raise a question at this time or make a statement rick? Perhaps you should mention that if they're calling in by phone, they can raise their hand by pressing star knife. Okay, thank you. That's. I think people would have heard that star nine. If you're calling in by phone, I think that claude has his hand raised. I do okay, you want to speak in public. I know I just want to say to refer diane, even though she's speaking before the budget committee. She should also address it to the education committee because they have connections with the cec and that might get back to appropriate people in the border bed. Thank you, claude all. Right there are no more hands. Okay, then we'll see. Oh, it looks like Corinne Van Der donk, who is a member of Ernie Board 6, would like the floor Corrin. I am saving. If I'm saving time for you during the committee's discussion, did you have something pretty in particular, you wanted to add outside of that? Yes, I just wanted to to Diane's comment. I just wanted to say that in the 197A committee that we're working on when it comes to the sale of Nathan Perlman Place, one of the main parts that we have is pre- k, seats, 3-K in precases for community use when those buildings are sold. Thank you. Corinne Jim Collins would request the floor Jim if this is if this is part of the public hearing, I just wanted to mention, as I always mentioned, as I've mentioned for many years now on my cassandra warning last month, the chairman of the Federal Reserve acknowledged the fact that the what they call the r star, which is the real interest rate on investments, had dropped from 4.25 to 2.5. That has nothing to do with the Federal Reserve manipulation rates and what have you? But it is very significant in that 2012 was the year in which New York City reduced its presumed, compounded annual growth rate from eight percent to seven percent, and we are now eight years in that's eight years in at seven percent and as a consequence, with the real interest rate down to as little as 2.5 the real interest rate, the one, the one that you get from just doing business as opposed to the Federal Reserve rate, which is much lower. As we all know, we are now have an enhanced risk premium on all of the city pension funds, and I think that it would be appropriate. Perhaps for this committee, if not the city Council, to suggest at least a 150 basis- point 1.5 percent reduction in the presumed, compounded annual growth rate. We are in a fiscal crisis and we will not be able to evaluate where we stand unless we face the facts and assess them properly, with that higher risk premium, a big downturn in the market with people retiring the boomers, particularly we're, never going to be able to make it up. That's all thank you Jim, and we take that as part of the public hearing, and it won't be a topic within our district needs statement, but it's something that I know you're not going to let slide and you're going to proceed with for years and years. You know it is not the first time we've heard it and you're. I think it's interesting. You call it the cassandra concept, because that's sort of what's happening, it's likely to cause some problems anyway. That's good! That goes credit for that goes to gene who dubbed it for me several years ago. Well, then, let's, okay, now, let's continue. Is there anyone else? Who wishes to speak during the public hearing? It seems like we have a hand raised by a member of the public who actually has a question regarding the testimony that Jim just gave, who is covered by the city pension plan, and how is it being changed? Would we like to address that question offline? If we can, how would you suggest we do that offline? I think it's something. That's not really a topic for the committee this evening. Nor is it really something that I really that I want to get into too much at this point, all right, so Mr Cohen, who asked that question. Please submit your question to CB6 via email. Our information is on our website and we'll do our best to address it all right, yeah, no, more hands. Okay, thank you very much, then. Actually Rachel would like the floor. Well, I mean I was going to answer that question if you wanted to, but we can just answer it through email later. I think I think, that's probably the better course of action. Now. We've got a lot to cover that is on our plate for now, and I think that's a very big topic very complicated and difficult okay. So it's seeing no further one further hands. The public hearing for community district 6 needs statement and budget request for fiscal year. 22 is now closed and we'll continue with the agenda. Okay, so here's what we're going to here's? What I propose. I promise that we would not go through the list item by item, but I think what we're going to do is go to the list item by item, but we can go through very quickly because we've already done it, we've already gone through most of these items. The some of the committee chairs have already commented. I think we have a couple that we want to focus on more carefully and we will look at those. That's particularly why corrine has joined us today, because a lot of the we have three. There were three topics that were part of the district needs statement. As our top three priorities, one was affordable, housing, one was parks and one was homelessness and affordable housing and homelessness both fall within Corinne's committee. So she has several items on our for our consideration. I'm not sure how we should do this corrine, but I'm thinking maybe just to go through the capital budget items and the first few are on housing. If you have anything to add beyond beyond the items itself just feel free to join in does that work yeah, I mean just run the meeting and I'll raise my hand if I feel I need to add something: okay, that sounds good, okay, so the first. The first item is to provide more housing for extremely low and low income households. This is an affordable housing item and I think we can probably just continue that the way it is are. Is there any objection for that being our lead item in capital[, Applause], okay, look number two more housing for special needs: households such as the formerly homeless. I think what we're dealing with here is actually homeless families, and I think what we want to do is probably. If we can, we can if we can find a request, what the city gives us is canned requests that we have to so we that we have to use- and this was the closest that we could find at the time I'm going to look to see if there's another one, that will focus our attention more on homeless families, and if so, we will do that. Jim. Do you want to speak? Jim you're, not you're, yeah, I'm sorry! I just wanted to confirm this is budget priorities for fiscal year ending 20 this week. This is the 2022 fiscal year, so it would be the one starting in July of 2021, okay. I thought we had talked about giving these budget priorities a more specificity with respect to subsequent years. I'm mistaken in that I thought I thought that aft, when we started the process for fiscal year, ending 2022 that we were going to be more specific as to particularly as with as respects the capital budget, rather than just saying direction of spending, basically amount of spending in terms of what what's actually needed. So, for example, if we we wanted more house more affordable housing in terms of total units total whatever I thought that was a discussion that we had last year request the floor brian. So that is not a requirement for our submissions to the city, so at a bare minimum, what we need to do is figure out what our priorities are from. The committees form an appropriate text for the budget, submission or budget priority submission and hand it off to the district manager for input into the city systems. It is our ideal that we improve requests by trying to get such numbers and in the process of trying to get such numbers also ask some questions about some of the requests in terms of are they truly needed or not? Because if we can't dig up numbers, it might be a sign that it is a. It is an item that's being requested through this process. That is not really going through the right channel to fulfill a need in the community. That said, we have a high amount of confidence for items one through ten on this list, and we should proceed with them, and if anybody has a suggestion along the way of a minor text amendment to the submission it would be appropriate, but we are not going to substantially shake this list upside down because of because certain submissions lack numbers, particularly some of this stuff- is really important. Some of this stuff will never get reliable numbers from the city. Some of this stuff just needs to go in, as is particularly items one through ten. If you have any questions about any of these items in particular, maybe we can discuss offline or we can discuss at the committees for which those budget requests are submitted. We are also not here to discuss items for of priorities for other committees, we're here to arrange things and try to improve these requests as much as possible. Thank you, yeah. I think thank you Brian that does conform with what we've talked about in the past and Jim. Yes, we have we. It would be very nice if we had more specificity. These have to be submitted by the end of October, which means that they have to be approved by the full board in Mid- October right. If we have any additional numbers by that time, we'll try. I think, the more the more likely thing that we can do is we can. We can probably do more about geography than we can about them can well just can we ensure that committee chairs are instructed specifically to come up with as much specificity in their in their budget requests as possible? I think we can do that for next year, but I do not think we can do that between now and October. No, they have they've been given situations. We everything that I said has also been communicated to the chairs, and many of the chairs have been responsive to what we've specificity. Yes, okay, it's not going to be perfect as we go through. You'll see that there is more. Some items are more specific than others as far as dollar amounts and geographic locations, and that sort of thing, so, let's keep moving moving forward. What's the distinction between item two and item four, they are the the. Unfortunately, the request is identical, but in item two we're talking about homeless families and in item four we're talking about folks that might be disabled or they might be, they need some kind of supportive services. That's the problem with some of this canned language yeah. Can I ask the board staff to put the link up for the through the through the chat log, the link up to the to the budget priorities through the chat log you mean just so we can follow along the air table that is being shared right now on your screen right, yes, okay, Brendan, can you yeah just copy paste that url should be? It should work yeah I'll, do that right now it just makes it easier to read. I can't hardly see it on my screen, yeah, I'm actually using a dip. I printed out some other material because it's hard for me to follow, but the advantage of this air table, which is something that the board office devised, is it has everything we could need in a discussion, including things like when was it first put in what agency was it referred to? What was the response? I mean it's got everything in there, so I do recommend it as a source. Okay, so number three improve accessibility of transit of transit infrastructure by providing elevators, escalators, etc and then there's a whole bunch of specific locations listed there. The only thing I'd like to refer back to the to the transportation committee is the question of what's been done at Grand Central and has that been taken into account in this write- up, because I know that they've done some work at Grand Central on access points, but other than that, I think it looks like it should stay where it is. If there's no objection, okay, number four housing for special needs. Households again, this is what claude was talking about. This is the supporting housing units. One of the things that has been a particular bugaboo for me is that they that too often you'll have people experiencing homelessness, put in a location and then given no support to help them get out of homelessness. It's just giving them a bed. So this is the kind of units. These are the kind of units that, if they're going to be putting more homeless people in our district, they should be putting in the services that go along with helping those people find a way out of homelessness, and that's the nature of this item. Okay, number five capital projects to improve access to the waterfront. I do not think we have any questions about that. If there are any, please let me know: we've gone through these before. That's why I'm kind of running through them the pep at Bellevue, based on the responses that are there, I think we can probably get rid of this item. I was one of the people saying we should keep it, but I think we can at least make it a continuing support item because they're basically saying that the project is fully funded. If the project is fully funded, we do not need to waste a top 10 ranking. Does anyone object to having it become a continuing support, the only one only person I know who knows more about this than me on this would be claude. Do you have any problem with that? No, it's been up there for a while, and I think they do have the funding. Okay, so we're going to make number six is going to go, is going to move, to continuing support, just to make sure that it's done and that would move everything up one level: okay, security, cam security cameras at Strauss houses. That was one from before. Do we have any questions or comments about that? One? Okay, I would just raise with if brendan. If you could make a note, one of the it says supported by solar one. I'm not sure that makes any sense to me, but maybe it maybe it is. Could you take a look into that which item again on number seven in the capital budget priorities on security cameras? Yes yeah? I do not know why solar one would be supporting that. I think it may be mislocated. It might be supporting something else, yeah. I can look into that, but thank you. Okay, num we're going to keep with the current numbering. Eight is newer, expanded park or playground. This one, I was surprised, was not familiar with this being in there last year, but it has identified some property that could be converted into a park since it was in there last year. I have no problem with keeping it there. Does anybody have anything to comment about this item? Okay, we're set with that location, then reconstruct or upgrade a building in a park, and this has to do with the assert Levy Recreation center. There's a whole bunch of items here, I'm assuming they're still needed, but I can't guarantee that we might need to get back to parks to find out whether they you know just what what ass or levy needs. Clearly they we can keep the item. It's just a question of what the explanation would be, so does anyone have any problem with the office pulling together the language there for the explanation, just to make sure that it conforms to the current situation? Okay, good off we go next one number 10 renovate upgrade or provide new community board facilities and equipment, considering the fact that we have a new, fairly new office and that we're currently in a situation where people are working remotely to a large extent. I do not feel comfortable with this as a number 10 item and would recommend that it be dropped to the end of the list of capital projects. Does anyone have a problem with that other than asus? Of course boy? Oh, I'm raising my hand, I'm sorry Brian. Then you and hogan request the floor and just fyi. We have not magnified the size of the text on the screen for those who are having trouble viewing it earlier. Oh good, thank you Brian. This request also it kind of lumps in the construction or provision of public space and assembly space, which would be a benefit to the community in any conditions. Although right now we're not doing any public assembly stuff, I think it's reasonable, given the juncture we're at that, we dropped this a little bit on the list, but we're also looking at a very long time frame here for the city to provide capital funding for this kind of thing. Yeah it does not need it does not necessarily need to apply to whatever our situation is next month. I think the district would be better off if this quest was funded. I do not think it should be 30, but yeah you can take it out of the top 10. yeah the there's. This there's a second there's a second public space item. So this one does not this one really is looking more at the district office being something that's owned by the city and how you might use it in other ways beyond just the Community Board office. I agree we're talk. We want to keep this around because we may need. It may be something that we're going to want to when, as things change in the next year or two, we may want to do something with it, but it certainly does not. We do not want it to take up the top ten yeah, and if the text for the request basically makes it look like it's just asking for an office, then we should just edit it because there was a. It was a broader vision and border vision involved on that. Okay, Jim Collins requests the floor, Jim yeah Rick, I think maybe one of the things a lot of private companies have done is allow their workers to get a small cash payment to reimburse for technical upgrades things like a larger screen. If you're working from home on a eight hour hours a day and staring at a notebook screen, I think it would be appropriate if we included in the wording that so long as we're under this pandemic, or even just for the convenience of the employee, occasionally that we let them purchase or have the city purchase a technic technology upgrade for their own use for the employees. So a large screen, what have you yeah that could fit under there's an expense? I think there's an expense item that speaks that's right. It would be an expense. It's not a capital item, a basic operational cost and we have I've already provided any upgraded screens or printers or any material to any member of the staff. Who wants it great good yeah, because that is something that people forget. They think oh well, we're saving all this money by people working at home you're, not because the people working at home have to pay. You know if you're, if you're, printing things out you got ta, you got ta, have ink cartridges, all that's being provided to every member of staff. Perfect! Okay is that is that worldwide, you know or citywide. I can't speak for. I can't speak for them, but every community board is a separate agency. So for us that's the case. Okay. Can claude Winfield request the form claude? I agree with moving the item concerning the new community board facilities, but I do not think we should move it too low and keep in consideration that, even though brookdale seemed to be a pacifish, it is still within the budget, the brookdale site, the sanitation garage, and we might consider that being incorporated in a request for whatever they're going to construct on that site the what we might be able to do now, I'm having trouble finding the location of this there's another item that talks about the potential for a multi- use public space that might include the district office but might have other things as well. I'm just trying to ensure that it appears in our district needs statement somewhere, so that there's evidence that we have a concern. Yep, let's see if we can Jesus. Do you remember where that is? I actually do not think we have that I'm not, maybe I'm think maybe I'm confusing. Maybe this was the only item that was of concern. Okay, we do not want to get rid of it you're absolutely right. Maybe we and we do not want it to be all the way at the very bottom, let's put a hold on the numbering for now and come back to the numbering. Just we could also include it in the 197a proposal for the msbi. It's another possible location. I think what the idea was to have not just the office space but to have a place where we could have community meetings. There is no place to have a social, a socially distant meeting of the Community board with all its visitors. I do not think there's any place that could take us. I do not know about public members, but I think in the the auditorium at at Beth Israel the hospital for joint diseases that might be possible right diseases might be yeah, but it's a limit. It does limit it and then you and you have a landlord in effect, who may or may not want to have those kind of functions. So we got it it's something that we do not want to lose track of this, but we'll we do not need it from the time I do. I do recollect, though, that there was some discussion in the 197a group about having you know: public space like for a senior center or something of that nature. So yeah it might be possible okay, so next one is rehabilitate bridges. The only question I had is the comment here is that the project has been included in the 10-year plan, which means to me that maybe it could be a continuing support. Is anyone familiar with the Waterside Plaza Pedestrian Bridge situation? Yeah? I am, and we've been, we've been putting this on the list for years and every time we do, we get the response from D.O.T that in fact they do have an overall plan to comply with the federal laws about ADA and they've got a list of bridges and a list of years that they're following out, and so that's what you said is pretty much exactly the case they will get to it. They'll get to it when they get to it. Okay, so we have a choice of leaving it where it is moving it down the list or moving it to continuing support. Do we have any opinions about that? I have not, you know those phrases I know just just. I have not seen any anybody put forward a budget or anything like that. For this, it is only a plan, so, if you're, using it's being listed with budgetary backing as the way to move it from capital to continuing support, this does not have that at least as far as I know, okay and Brian, you had a comment yeah. I would say that the if there's any issue with this request, it's not how it's phrased or where it is on the list. The issue is that we now need the full backing of community activists to get this thing moving, because we're being straight up, ignored on it. Okay, let's leave it where it is and we'll we're now, and we if we need to make a change, it's something we could play with, but it looks like we might as well just leave it where it is one of the things that they do. Is they look at they look at where the OMB and the agents various agencies here, the Department of Transportation will look at its its ranking and if we continue to rank it fairly, high it'll eventually get done, but it, but I'm not a big optimist about when these things get done. Okay, so the next one is provide technology upgrade and it looks like it's ps, 116 security system. I think we can take out the reference in the description about early voting, because I do not think they're doing early voting at Ps6116, but other than that. There's no reason to say if they do not have a security system, they probably should okay we'll leave that to where it is other transportation, infrastructure, post office trucks. I you know, I do not know what to do with this, because technically the post office is not under our jurisdiction and if those people want to po on a park wherever they want to park they're going to park there they're not going to listen to us yeah, but we could. I mean we got another item here that talks about buses like it's inner state, buses that come into town and they just sit on the and idle as well. If we said that there should be a parking facility for buses and, for example, post office trucks, would that make any sense I mean otherwise. I just do not see any point in keeping something related to buses. I mean it. People the neighborhood, was really annoyed with all those trucks taking up parking spaces and blocking the streets, and it was. It was a service issue for sure so, but I just do not know if it's worthy of a budget request here. Anybody not to interrupt you done. No, I'm done. Okay, we were trying to find a. We were talking about a couple of spots for the bus parking that were basically more in Midtown. The post office problem is basically in the 20s around the post office yeah. I really seriously doubt that Usps would cooperate by parking their vans and trucks in Midtown just to get them off our streets. So in practical terms, so combining does not make any sense so rick. It's me: I've been trying to raise my hand, I just think, you're out of your jurisdiction when you're dealing with the Post office and federal stuff. I think you should really deal with things that you can influence in an agency yeah. I do not. The post office is one of them yeah. No, I think you're right. I also see that Brian has his hand raised Brian yeah. I was just going to say that yeah, I guess we can. If we do not think the post office truck thing is a big deal, we can take it away. I think that if it feels like it's kind of a weird request, it's still something where you know post office trucks are routinely stored on the street for several different offices. So you know we. This would benefit the district people who are dealing with it. The bus thing is it busting a different request? It's I guess it's 16. again, something that would tremendously benefit the district because of the amount of the difficult situation was by the bus volumes and we need the buses we need transit. I do not think we're going to get any. I do not think we're going to get fewer buses or less demand for buses anytime soon, so that seems to be the direction to go in yeah. So I'd like a a sense of should we remove this item or should leave this item. I think we've eliminated the possibility of combining the item. Yeah, I had my hand raised. Okay, thank you. I agree with b and speaking from experience. My brother was a supervisor of those trucks in the Bronx at 149th street. I can tell you they're not going to listen. Okay, does anybody have any objection to us eliminating item number thirteen, okay, new and expanded parks, Facility recreation center, a new comfort station at Murphy, Brothers playground? Now one of the things I karin are you still around 18 years ago? What I was thinking was. What we might do here is expand this to include your comments about comfort, station restroom facilities that are needed, and do you want to just speak to that? A little bit sure I'm sure most of you have most of you have heard in the news. Just a big issue that comes up with the unsheltered among us is that they, because the libraries are closed, start you know anywhere where people were creatively trying to do something that needs to be done, that those places are now closed, and so what happens is- and I was just spending an hour and a half listening to people about the Dog Hamas called Plaza the problems there. You know Bellevue South Park has a big problem of people. You know using flower beds and stairwells and children's playgrounds as bathrooms. Our unsheltered are not going away anytime soon and regardless I mean people need to use restrooms, and so our request from hhhr. Our new request is a focus on creating public restrooms acrosss. You know as well does that is that enough rick? Or do I yes? Absolutely because I wanted to. I wanted folks to know that it was coming from the committee and that the basic principle there is, if you're released from a homeless shelter in the morning, and you can't return until the evening. Just what are you supposed to do and it's a question to me of basic human of dignity and giving people in a way that they do not do something that they'd rather not now they're always going to be crazy people. But we also need to accommodate those people who have no other choice. And I, what I was thinking of doing was expanding Karen has given some language to get us started, but to expand this item to be like more than one location where we would have some kind of restroom solution, such as the kind of elaborate porta potties. They were once at one time were espousing the ones were like self- cleaning and had water and that kind of stuff yes yeah, the Bloomberg administration, bought, I believe, 20 or 25, and are still in storage somewhere right installed. Yeah and people have pointed out to me that they've been very hard to get because people were trying to get them for the waterfront and it required special plumbing. It required this and required that. But I do not think we should, just if it just because it's difficult to do does not mean that we should not include it as something that is an aspirational item, and it also shows that we care, I mean it's. These budget items are more than just dollars and cents. They also said they also set a tone and a policy from the Community Board, and I think one of the things that would be very nice to be able to expand this. Would anybody have any objection to having this item expanded to include, say four locations and you, and I would leave it for Corinne's committee, to give us some language for the explanation. If I could just interject something I mean Murphy's brother's playground in particular is part of the whole escr thing that is going to be redone. So if you really want to move on that park in this direction, it'd probably be a good idea to show up jointly with land use in some form when those presentations are going down, because those plans are pretty much set now they start work this month, not on Murphy's brothers per se, but on the whole East River. That's a that's a very good, helpful observation. Maybe we could make maybe we'll just make the other restrooms a totally separate item, keep the Murphy brothers one. Do you know if the comfort station is part of the plan for the escr? I do not. I they. There is a comfort station, as I remember, but the details. I do not sorry. No, that's fine rick! Yes, man! Yes, there was. There was a request for a comfort station somewhere like around 20th street, but I think it got lost in the in the task force discussions, so it is appropriate to try to bring it back up now. Would you say as part of the escri discussions, it was 23rd street or just in general in general, and if you can get it through the yes, whatever? Yes, Jim Collins request the floor. Jim yeah, I was just going to say the insofar as locating these things and locating near the waterfront. Perhaps the best place to put a a toilet would be near the ferry, the 20 21st street. I think it is yeah. That's what that's what I was saying that we were looking at yeah, but the other thing is. I just pulled up an article I sent to Corinne, but I can send it to the committee these toilets when we got into them in 2006 2007 somewhere in there, and I think the contract was inked in 2006.. They actually required a payment of 25 cents. If you use it and then there was a self- cleaning facility after you closed the door so perhaps going forward, though they should be done by some kind, maybe the equivalent of a fare card or some kind of debit card that could be distributed to homeless free so that they can use them for free instead of a quarter or whatever. You know, you take a quarter from a homeless guy you're going to have an argument: yeah the okay. So how do you how any suggestions on how best to approach this? We could keep murphy brothers playground as an item and then a second item be an additional number where we would identify locations, hopefully or and then add a catch- all ex thing that would this one. It sounds like this. One is a that they're looking for a full com, comfort station, which I I'm not quite sure what that means, but it's the washroom. Basically, it's a toilet with a wash space would it have like a person present to no it's totally automated, at least the ones that were correct. I just want to say that I agree with having it as a separate item and then you know we already started the language, and I know that rich mints is actually editing the Google doc, while this meeting's going on. So I'm curious to see what he's coming up with, but we can definitely work on that more and happy to take any suggestions and thank you Jim for suggesting something, some kind of ebt card or whatever we want to call it yeah, it's just the debit card, yeah. Well it in it and it helps and helps make sure that it's targeted to the people who actually need it as opposed to somebody who might want to use it for some other purpose. Okay, so where would we put the the additional sanitation items like the? If we have the com additional comfort stations, we have to stick it someplace in this priority list. Shall we just put it at like right after the one for Murphy's brother or right before it, or why do not? We put it right. My suggestion is: we'll put it right after the Murphy's brothers one so that they're together, the only other choice, would be to raise it so that it gets more attention. My vote, is it I'm only one person, though, and I'm not on the committee, I do not get to vote. Thank you and not to be not to you know emphasize it, but we also do not want you to be too greedy, because you've got like half the top 10 anyway Rick. This is b. Yes, you should raise it. This is a community of life issue. This affects a lot of people. If you do not have these facilities, I think it is something that the city, you know, won't look at if it's lower. Unfortunately, a lot of the services to homelessness you've seen what has happened, so I would vote to raising it because I think it affects everyone how about we're moving down we well, we took out the c pep made it. We can put it as number six. We want to go higher than that accessibility, transit special needs. Are you able to scroll through, so we can see where it's good, so we can kind of figure out how we want to put it right, because, right now it starts off with 12.. Oh yeah, could you scroll for Us Brendan? Okay, so the numbers there are in the? If you look at the column, that's Fy21 rank. What we've done is we've eliminate we've moved item six to continuing support and I was just going to raise everything else. You know, but we can stick something in there or we can put it any place. I mean we do not have to because it can be any place there. I think it belongs above the Pedestrian bridge, so I think we we're talking. We need it to be in the top ten. That's all I can say we just need. We definitely need it to be in the top 10. So it gets the proper scrutiny. Well, I think it should really go. This is be after your house facility. Am I looking at it right? That would be seven item. Seven. No! What am I looking at then, because I see six provide a new and expanded health care facility. That's six! Oh six! Oh I see you think you get seven! Well! Actually we've taken that number six out, so we could replace the number six item. With the restroom item I mean, maybe it should be even above having the continuous equinox, because, while that's nice, it is not to your point that this is giving dignity to people to have a conversation. You know to have a place. Well, that's a good point. Rick one thing, OMB has sort of told us off. The record is that the boards need not really agonize like over it. Should it be six or should it be? Seven, should it be twelve or should it be thirteen, so get it in the general neighborhood, and you know they can sort of work with that? Okay, so why do not we just use Occam's razor and put it in number six. Thank you. I was going to just say that yeah, it's easiest, yeah, absolutely easiest thing is just we'll make that number six, so number six will now be the the restroom issues, with information to be provided by Corinne. We'll make a note of that and we'll update it in the next day or two. One of the things that you may want to do is site specific, so that yeah that they apparently all go through transportation. According to the article I'm reading now that I've sent to Corinth, apparently they all go through the transportation department of Transportation and they're, the ones that have final authority as to whether or not a site is proper. Apparently they've tried to put some in Brooklyn in what we're deemed residential areas on the community board rejected. But if we're, if we're citing it, you know ourselves with some again with some degree of specificity, which I think is always important, and this is the kind of specificity that we can do. We can say it should be near 23rd street. It should be 23rd and first location or it should be in Stuyvesant square park, or I should be in at Catherine Hepburn Park on 47th street, apparently they've got over a dozen of them that are still outstanding under the contract, the contract's going to expire in 12 years. I think the idea that we could actually get them, though I think, is pretty slim, but we got to go on the record. We got to get them we got to you know we got to push on a few things, and this is one that I feel comfortable pushing on okay, so we got that taken care of. Where are we, I think to 15, since the committee was discussing the Murphys Brothers Park comfort station before yes? Thank you. Where was that so Murphy's brothers was 14.. Just in terms of addressing that, I would strongly suggest getting input from the Manhattan kickers Soccer League and the and the steinsontown little league find out whether or not they're supported, because those folks can muster hundreds of people if they oppose thousands of people if they oppose it, for something at Murphy's brothers. Yes, we are all we're going to be looking for supporting documentation on some of these. So if they're willing to support it, that'll be really good right, but, as I say I would go, I would talk to them before committing a potential site there, because you can always move it somewhere else. You could move it. You know. If they oppose it, then it dies yeah. If they do not fine, you know, but we lose it. If they oppose it, you may lose it. You know about a specific like a specific corner or something like that. Yes, not the concept itself, they would probably welcome the concept. Well, maybe okay, that's good brendan. Can you make a note of that for me please for us, please that we need to find. We need those two. What was the two organizations? Jim, the Peter steines of Little league and the Manhattan kickers Soccer league, and you may not want to put it at Murphy's brothers. You may want to put it up where the older kids play, which is near the Con Edison field, there's a parking lot, acrosss the street that comed uses and that may be, or on that block it's probably more suitable, yeah little kids. You know you get them in the toilet and stay there all day yeah. Well, hopefully they would not be the ones using that yeah they would anyway, okay, just double checking the petersburg I ran so just double: checking the Petersburg Little League and then the other entity is the Manhattan kicker soccer league. So we want to keep want to keep rolling here. The precinct request the floor, Brian yeah just really quickly. We should not really discuss sighting in this committee. We if we have any comments on that we should that should be absolutely discussed in the host committee for the request, not on our committee. We just need to be really. We should stick to that because we're disenfranchising parks from having a meaningful debate on it. It's their responsibility. That's a good point. I would also say that what we could do is we could make a recommendation, but refer it to parks before it goes into any document. I would suggest coal a joint committee between transportation and parks, because transportation, like I say, department of Transportation- has ultimate overs oversight on these. Most of these are located on sidewalks or near sidewalks, okay, you're, making it more and more likely that it's not going to have any specificity whatsoever. I do not think we have time to get all that done, but anyway, we'll work on it on we go to number 15 precinct houses. This project was funded in a prior fiscal year and the scope is now underway. I suggest we delete this item houses, so it would be upgrades for the 13th and the 17th precinct houses, primarily the 13th. I think no, it's the 13th only. Why? Because the response from the NYPD was, this project was funded in a prior fiscal year and the scope is now underway. So we do not need it that it's not for any kind of political reason. It's just it's funded, so we can get rid of the number 15. other transit infrastructure requests. This is the buses and where they go, I think we need to keep that. I know transportation has done a lot of work on that. So, unless somebody has any objection, we'll just keep that on them, 17 new, a new or renovate up or upgrade an existing public library. There is some question about whether the epiphany library needs the external things that we thought it needed, and it's been recommended that it be that the item being removed, Sandra visited the library, the epiphany library and was told by the library manager that interior work was no longer needed. Well one of the things that I'd like to visit- and this would have to come from the committee- but I'd like to see whether we could- whether the libraries actually need to make internal changes to make them safe in things like the shutdown so that you can socially distance and keep the libraries open, at least in part, during a shutdown. The libraries are a source of computer usage for some people, they're a source of books for others, their community gathering places if they can be done. If some of these older buildings can be retrofitted to make it work, I think that would be really nice. If we can't, then we can get rid of the item altogether, but if this is an opportunity to respond to the virus and how it's affecting our community, maybe this is one of the ways we can do it. Anybody have any suggestions about that Rick. This is b. I just want to comment on it because I'm dealing in my professional life with the vulnerable population and what I have seen in what I'm dealing with it, is having the lack of access to libraries for the ability to get on various websites and internet applications are really hampering the low social economic because they just do not have that kind of facility. So I would wholeheartedly support that I've actually seen it professionally a decline in people applying for need. Okay, if I can, if I can convince pam to shift this to an interior alteration and if we have time to do it, do I have the consent of the committee to try that hearing none. I was going to say so moved what I'll do is I'll contact Pam I'll talk to Pam? Who is, I think, the one who said let's get rid of it, but we do not need it in the way that it's framed. We might we need it in the way that we need to think about it, a little more creatively and responsibly so I'll talk to Pam, that's Pam, Vassell who's, that just for the record, Pan Vassal is the chair of the parks and recreation committee that also deals with libraries parks and cultural affairs. Okay, Reconstruct upgrade a park or amenity in this case it's irrigation and water access for Peter, Detmel Park. This was suggested it be removed. I'm not sure how that came up. Maybe it came from the committee, so I could rick I'm on the Parks Committee, and so we were told by parks. That issue was taken care of okay. I can't I can't say that I've seen it I've been in that park and I have not seen anything, but I guess you know things take a while yeah, so that may be something we should double check. Yeah brendon have we heard from Dean Stephanie's about this since he lives in that area and works in that park. I believe Dean did comment and say that the request was no longer necessary. I can we'll double check. I can dig up that email to double check. Well, we'll if we thank you if you could double check, but otherwise we'll get rid of that item reconstruct or upgrade a building in a park. Ralph Bunch, Park havers. The problem with this one is that there's scaffolding in the way and until that scaffolding is removed, there's really not much progress that can be made. This is one of the things that's been on the list forever. Well, if the committee says get rid of it, we'll get rid of it. Yes, Rick do not get rid of it. Please it's unwalkable! It really is: it's been, as you know, for years, yeah that scaffolding should be down because 45 took down their scaffolding and that's 45 scaffolding, huh, okay, 45 to the city place is scaffolding, and I understand that has been down because they have the restaurant on the Pla on Tudor city place. That's on first avenue with the scaffolding that you're referring to, but that's all part of that same building yeah, and the response is that the city is not going to do it from the city from the parks budget, but that we might be able to get money from the borough president or council member. It could also be what's that process participatory budgeting, yes, participatory budget items. Maybe we should leave it the way it is. Let's, let's hold on to that one and not remove it. I think having the testimony of a Tudor city person is a good enough for me. Okay upgrade the elevators Locker room and elevators. I thought that was all done at 54th street. We can reach out to the Parks Department director of Rec centers, to see if she can confirm yeah. I this work still needs to be done. Yeah. I thought the roof they've been working on that. I think that roof was completed like five years ago, so again, rick the issue with that roof was and again. This was pre- covered when they came and spoke to the committee, but they wanted to the roof was done, but it's not accessible to people right now and they did not have enough space because they were trying to use the other areas of the Rec center for both children during the day, but there were seniors who also wanted to use the facilities and they thought that they could have fitness classes on the roof for seniors. Well, I like that yeah okay. Well, why do not we just? Let's just keep it then? Okay, the next one is Murphy brothers, playground at a dog run for some reason, that's put down as ah. Why not any objection to that item? Okay, again, just quick, real, quick work. I'd suggest that I do not remember the status of the dog run in the Escr Redo of Murphy's brothers park, but somebody better check it, because this is this is already happening. This is in process, so we should find out what they've actually proposed in detail for that. Okay, just on that dog run, I took it up with somebody from council member power staff and apparently everybody was on board with it was a while ago that was easily last year, maybe two years ago. So I presume that the East side coastal resiliency is built into it. I would hope yeah, but I do not know. I do not know either. So that's why I'm saying check yeah okay check, keep it but check with the S escape plans: Okay Upgrade subway stations, other transit infrastructure, Second, Avenue subway. You know, we've been having putting that on here. There's as far as I know, is there any free money, that's going towards the second avenue so well, Rick number one. I do not think the language reads correctly, though, to repair and upgrade you're talking about building a new subway line, not repairing and upgrading and stage two is going to have to be done before you even consider stage three and stage two is almost partially done, because the tunnels are built up to about 110Th, Street and they're, nowhere near getting to that they're trying to get all of the funding for that and the third stage of the Second Avenue subway requires a special kind of boring because of the rock underneath. So I do not know why we have that up on the agenda so prominently because it's light years away. Okay, let's, let's drop that one to the bottom. I see Brian raised Ryan, so just for some context, the whole thing where it says repair or upgrade subway stations or other infrastructure. That's a result of the city and omd, giving us a drop down box in which that's the most appropriate thing to click. That's not our! That's! Not our text that we're submitting on that is 99.9, probably the correct drop- down thing to pick in the city system. Just we have limited options. We should continue to pursue capital funding on this, and maybe it's fine at the bottom of the list. As long as it's on the list. Maybe it's fine in the middle of the list, but this is just another thing where it's like we need. We need somebody to. We need people around the city, including our electeds and the governor, to feel like. This is a super important issue to us that we are not going to shut up until this is funded and that we're going to not make life easy for them until there's actual movement on this claude's we're pretty much on the mark about the second phase. But the problem is that they're saying that outfitting, the second phase with stations and a little bit more tunnel is going to cost 10 billion, so we're not getting a good rest. I mean the whole situation is maybe pretty beyond the purview of the board, but we just need to keep fighting for that capital money for the third phase. While we insist that second phase either get completed or not hold up what we need, we need to push our Congress person as long as they're there yeah. We need to vote in November. Well, that's the one! That's been getting the money yeah, that's true! That is true, honestly, just to finish a little bit. What Brian said. The only way this makes any sense to me at all is: if we put this in the category that we did with the queen's bridge at full board, where it's something that we put it somewhere on the list farther down and use it as something that the planning gets to the point where it's shovel ready, so that if the feds decide to infuse money into the city for projects for infrastructure, we've got some stuff there, but other than that yeah claude's right I mean this may happen in the lifetime of I do not know 20 2300, you know yeah. I do think that getting money from the feds on this would be really nice. I think that gives a big free pass to the state government for not investing right now. The state government does not have any money, so what we're trying to do is if we want to keep this item when I'm suggesting we look at it as something that we put in that category, like the like the Queens bridge. Where was like something that we're looking for the future, we're hoping for infrastructure infusion from the feds and if we get that we have to have projects that are ready to go, or at least cons planned out enough, so that they're believable, so that the feds will actually put some money toward it. Whether it's just beginning the thing or whatever. The only other thing I'm going to throw in here for color is that the very next transportation related item to DOT is curb cuts. If we want to say that the curb cuts are more important than the subway, we can sequence it that way, but no that I was not saying anything like that and in fact the curb cuts are especially when it's something like that. Install immediate remediate range for curb cuts at intersections. I can tell you straight up that unless there is a specific, locale or specific list, nothing is going to happen. Well, I mean I'm just saying that we would be prioritizing it on our list of requests and in this process we are not. We should not be requesting individual curb cuts and we need to request that the DOT be infused with a capital for doing a program around the district. To do this kind of thing. No, actually what we need to do is have DOT, do surveys, planning surveys and to decide which areas actually need them, but we're getting off topic, and this is something thank you inside the transportation committee. Not here, that's yeah. Let's bring that conversation over to transportation for an agenda. If I can come, I think I'm listening to the comments. I think we should keep the second Avenue subway on the symbolism, even though I agreed with court it'll be past our lifetimes, but it's very symbolic that people can kind of get around and can keep moving to Congress the feds in the state. So I think we should leave it on the list where it goes on the list. I do not really care, but I think it needs to be there. Okay, let's leave it where it is. It used to be number one five years ago. It was the number one item: it's worked its way down to 11., we'll let it go or whatever it is: 21 21., no 22.. Okay, let's keep going because I really do want to get through these things and I'm taking far longer than I intended to my apologies. Rick, it looks like Ozzy. Abadi has raised her hand, nazia welcome, hi thanks, so much guys. I just wanted to check because I was a little late joining. I was curious if you guys had spoken about the capital budget request for a senior center. No, I can't see on the screen how far down it is. That's why we've gotten there yet okay I'll wait, then I'll wait for when you guys get there good. That would be very. I do need some help with that. Okay, let's keep going and we'll catch up. St Barton's park was not there. Something recently done with Saint Gardens park. It's 23rd out of 23.. Yes, I mean they presented a rebuild plan to us and it's all done so. I do not know if they still need funding. I mean I can check with the park people or with Pam on the okay. If it does not require, if it does not require funding, we can make it continuing support and if it has not yet been funded, then we'll keep it at 23., okay, and if and if you could do that, restaurant that'd be great. If you can do it this week, yeah I can. I can. I can do it tomorrow morning. So perfect, okay, okay, Street, install streetscape improvements, curb cuts. You know it from the response. It definitely does sound like it needs specific locations, but if we have not been given them by the committee, I guess we'll just let that go. If the committee can come up with some. It was my understanding. These things are done in that the drainage kind of curb cuts are done on a schedule and they're not going to vary the schedule. We're not talking about curb cuts that happen when there's a construction project going on we're talking about curb cuts that are deemed essential to clear out intersections of bugs rick you're right. The curb cuts are done on the schedule and they're done through one contractor, so it they will designate how many they're going to do with that contract and that's what they'll do because 24th street took us eight years ago. The comments under from the department of Transportation was sidewalks of the responsibility of adjacent property owner, which has nothing to do with anything and for curb repair. Please submit specific locations to the borough, commissioner, for review for Pedestrian ramps. The executive budget includes a city- wide allocation. Specific locations are determined by DOT. So basically, if you do not have specific locations, you're not getting anything and even then you're not likely to get anything so yeah. I think this unfortunately has to be one that this is the way the committee has submitted it. If, if those members of the of this committee who are on transportation, want to pursue that specific locations, that would be great, otherwise we'll just leave it. The way it is it's a totally ineffective request, but we'll leave it the way it is okay park safety through design interventions, better lighting, that's asking for a security system for Bellevue South Park. I think we have to leave that one. If anything, we could move it up, but let's leave it where it is Enhance park safety through design interventions in this case we're talking, doug hammerschool park. We have definitely have to have something about that because of the complaints from the community, we can leave it where it is more and better equipment to a library. Again, here's another place we could put in the the impact of the pandemic on the closings this one in this write- up. We specifically mentioned the computers. Where was we were talking about the other one? That was the item about epiphany library? Maybe we can consolidate the two that would be item 17 and 27.. Maybe we can have a single item that talks about resources for the library? Well, no, I think this is a cool thing to inquire about on the off season, like maybe we can ask if they feel like that would be effective, yeah. Well, I'd suggest I'd suggest they do. I agree that we should inquire about it and I think it should be actually probably one item because we're talking about as b pointed out. You know the libraries are places that people go not to get booked so much as to use the equipment and to get access to online and they need that stuff. Now more than ever. So whether that's going to happen or not, is something else, but I mean the two: the two items are clearly related, they're clearly related, but is one a structural design change and the other an equipment, design change, that's a good question and maybe those need to be separated. I think they would be separated. One is in physical infrastructure and the other is you know, and is not that an expense item anyway, frequently well, no they're talking about fiber optic cabling, oh okay, we're talking about computer stations and yes, but when they're talking about wiring and stuff that gets into it, okay, let's leave it where it is, and we'll do two items just to emphasize the point, but we're going to definitely redo number 17 to reflect making the space usable and for people in tough situations. Okay, improve access to a park or amenity Tudor City's ramps on 42Nd Street. This comes up all the time, rich mom. What's going on in your neighborhood? Well, I actually did I've gone to check on this several times now for CB6, and I mean the one issue is no one is claiming responsibility for it. Yeah right, there's some I mean if you ask transportation, D.O.T is saying: oh, it's, the Tudor city's responsibility to the city is saying it's doc. There was even someone who said it's the parks responsibility. You know so yeah. Excuse me: it's the city's responsibility. We did not build those stairwells. Those were that used to be a roadway that went up because went east and west underneath the bridge was a trolley. They tore that down to when the U.N came in I've. Seen pictures of this, and so that those stairwells and the ramps going up to the city does not even exist, has not existed since 1987. and or we use the name, because that's you know was the original name, but there were 14 buildings, then Hemsley bought it and he tried to ruin it and we went to there's a go online and look at the lawsuit it's pages and pages. That was to save our parks. So you can't blame anything on us and they've tried the Tudor City Association. I have told the office on many times. We do not own anything, we own stationery, that's it. The problem page is that it's not we're. Not accusing anybody of anything. The city just won't take responsibility and the city does not take responsibility so wow. What do we do with your request? Let somebody start a lawsuit. They'll take responsibility straight away when they get the you know they have to go to court. That's about the only way I see them taking responsibility. So what do you want to do with this request? Well, I think it's I do not. What are we going to do it? The city has to take responsibility: okay, we're going to leave we're going to leave 28 alone and let them figure it out, yeah and just to quickly interject. I've also been dealing with this as a service request, and basically, second, what reisma has said that that you know basically everything that rayshma said is what I've experienced as well. Okay, let's see okay, 29, improved traffic and pedestrian safety traffic calming Walkway counters. I do not know what this is, but if it comes from transportation, I assume somebody can what's going on here, because the response is sidewalks are the responsibility of the adjacent property owner for curb repair from a big location. What is what does that have to do with walkway counters yeah, so this came from this was suggested to the transportation Committee Adam Hartke had a much more solid idea of the exact equipment to buy based on his professional work and essentially counters for walking and biking would be really good for the district and actually are pretty cheap, they're. Barely a capital request because we're like basically trying to buy something- that's maybe eight thousand dollars a piece, and so we're bundling them as like a request for seven or eight of them to get them in the capital plan so we're like. Maybe this would be easy. Maybe we get a grant for this? Maybe this be paid for by a council member, because DOT could certainly use the data and for some reason it's back on our list. So there's no capital request too small for an agency to give us a total non-, sequitur rejection, yeah now, what's being counted, people are trying to crossing three people walking past, essentially or biking past in case of a dual purpose: counter: okay, so it it's like the people that stand out there with the little clickers. Yes, counting cars as they go by, except in this case it's people and bikes. Is that right? Okay, I guess we can leave it build or expand incubator or affordable work or research lab spaces. I do not. That's seems fine to me. Has anybody got any comments about that? Rick, the EDC put out a RFP, probably in 2015, for this type of location. They were primarily looking at in our area. Looking at 26Th street, what's the building called there? It's not a workable building anymore research building once they do disease infectious disease is that 26th street on first day, 61st yeah, like the medical examiner's building yeah, but no on the west side of the street. The public health lab yeah, the public health lab that building is almost non- usable. They were looking at that location, I'm totally similar to like Bellevue, where it has small things and they believe the only good thing in that building is the auditorium. So it has not gone anywhere since 2015.. Well, what the heck? Let's get, let's see if we can get some more life science, people coming in in crew of this Murphy brothers overpass, have we have we really can we give up on this? One years ago I had advocated to get a a traffic island in there between the crossing from Stuyvesant town into Murphy's brothers park, just because I had nightmares of little kids getting run over, so they put they put an island in there. It was under garodnik when he was council member, and that was just a solution to an overall problem. I mean now the traffic light is, I think, it's I think, they've improved the timing of the traffic light and in any event, you can make this crossing in two separate stages, but it used to be you would cross in a single stage and with you know, you got a six year old in toe and a and a baby in a stroller there's some it was impossible to do. Well, that's a bomb we'll! Do anyone that's true! Well, all you need is a puppy scared, the death out of me when I, when you know my boys, were little, it looks like the Parks Committee has suggested we removed. That is that correct. That is correct. Okay, in the conversations for escr, this was never brought up, and so it's not included so okay, so it's gone and 32 is playground, upgraded, Park and Macarthur Park. That's a kid's playground! I'm surprised that the they chose to take out this request, but that's what the committee did. I guess right. We did not. Nobody in the office did that right. This was a preliminary review by the committee chair and vice chair themselves. So it has not gone all of these rooms items that are stated for removal. That's how they've gotten that way. It has not gone before the entire committee yet, but the vice chair and the committee chair raised questions about why this park needed this, because we have no data to suggest that it does. Okay, I think we can. We can add that to the list of things to talk to Pam about, but probably taking it out, and now we come to the scene, create a new senior center or other facility for seniors, which is listed as the last item for some reason and ozzy was there something you wanted to just listen into the conversation? Or did you want to make a point? I did not know. We had gone down to the last item in the capital budget request, but this has been on our capital budget request, at least for 10 years, if not longer, maybe 15 or 20. I've heard, and my understanding is that the department for the aging does not have the capacity to build more senior centers. What they have done is implemented senior centers when there have been other developments, sort of like as a public benefit, but on the flip side, what we did when I was chair of health and education was, since we knew that we were not going to get the capital funding. We encouraged and pushed for programming funding for programs that would help older adults, so we saw greater use of, like the library started, doing Falls prevention, programming and programming for older adults, and we actually asked for that and saw that happen at Kipp's Bay Library in some of the other libraries. So I am hesitant to completely remove it, but it's one of those pieces that most likely will never get built, and I wonder if maybe doing something like a multicultural community center Multi multi- age community center may be better as an option. If we want to continue to have public spaces that communities can use, I was going to suggest that we it may require moving this to the expense. I was going to say that yeah and then focus on programming, yes, claude, but this is kind of being looked at in terms of the 197A in terms of the miles Sinai site, there's an interesting enduring interest in doing intergeneral general generational, housing and stuff on that property. So it is a consideration, and the only thing that I have to agree- I agree with us here- is that since I've been on the board, we've been going in reverse: we've lost consistently more and more senior centers. We've lost, at least two to that two or three that I know that we used to have, and so I reached out to the parks Committee just a couple days ago I mean I'm sorry, the health and Education Committee. I have not heard back from John, but I did hear back from Abigail and they're going to they're going to look into what the needs are at the Stein Center, because at a minimum they're going to need to redo the way the configuration of some of those they're going to need to have socially distant activities. Those places are not set up for that and there's a real need to reach out to the spine center. They have not necessarily been that collaborative in terms of working with us yeah over the last five six years, so there's a real need. There yeah they had some instability in their leadership. I think part of that's been the problem, but I do think that my only thing claude is, I think it's really awesome that the 197A will look into having an intergenerational housing and maybe a hopefully associated community center, but that's still at like 17th and 18th street, and the Stein center is at 23rd. Street still are missing the middle. This. The big piece of this was having something that was in the middle of the district, because we know that people really are hesitant to go more than 10:15 blocks right and most older adults walk. So the libraries was an option because there were more of those if there were hospitals, but I do think I mean I'm just thinking. We need to think yeah. Let's do this. Let's keep this item we'll rework the explanation so that it's a little bit more flexible of like it could fit into the 197a discussion, then, in the expense which we're going to turn to next, I'm going to just skip the continuing support items I want to get to the expense items and in the expense items we'll find a way to say something about programming and how to deliver services in this new environment, because I think a lot of it. Even I can't remember where I saw this, but there was something about the seniors in our district are less likely to go to a senior center than they are to take advantage of a single program like a a class or a yeah, some kind of activity on a one- off basis, or even a even a course. That might be several but they're not really they're, not really into it. For the lower priced lunch so much and who knows whether that that'll ever be something that they can do again, but ah ellen they do. They do a. They have a mean belly dancing class. Yes, in the belly dancing- and I just add that the way the department of aging funds these centers is based on meals, served yeah cancer meals. It's a real problem. Okay, I do not. I do not know how funding is going right now, yeah, okay, so are we all okay with moving on to the expense? That's like, let's see, if we can finish this off in 30 minutes or less, is that? Okay, yes, less 10 minutes or less is good yeah. Okay. The number one item here is run away in homeless, youth requests and it talks about the services required for children in homelessness. I'm not sure that should be our number one item. I would suggest that number two and number one be switched and that our number one be the homeless outreach teams. Maybe I'm nitpicking if people think I'm nitpicking. That's okay with me tell me, but I think both are val. Both are valuable. Both are both are valuable items. It's just a question of. We do need to get corrine's right up on the street outreach programs and she's already working on that so they're going to help us fill in the explanation. I support the change. Speaking of Karen, I see, has raised her hand corrine. Please speak hi so peak at length, because I need to step away from the camera for a minute. Oh no, okay, talk as long as you can. I can hear you, oh okay, good. Well, so I mean I was going to keep it short, but last when we were researching when I was researching this last year and a year before that I spoke with several administrators at public schools and they feel that, beyond the kind of social worker debate that was going on, they feel that they have enough funds and services for homeless students, and so I would definitely move that move. It was. I think health and education wanted to keep it on, but it's definitely not a priority. From my standpoint, Aussie body requests the floor. All right. I was just actually going to like corroborate what Corinne said, because it came on a couple years ago when we had an increase of homeless students in CB6 in the schools, and we wanted to make sure there was supportive programming for them, and it sounds like from Karen's research that actually has been alleviated. Well, what does that mean? Does that mean we should get rid? We should move it off altogether or continuing support, there's no continuing support in expense. It's a perfect one for that. Jim Collins requests the form Jim just on the outreach teams and maybe corrine. You can lend your expertise here. A few years ago there was there was media reporting that these outreach teams were only having an effect on one percent of the people to whom they reached out. In other words, they were only able to get one percent of the of the of the targeted outreach people into shelters, principally because the shelters I think are deemed by many homeless to be unsafe. Do you know if that number has improved at all? Are we not doing something right in with respect to that program? If that number is still that low, I mean I have not heard that particular number. That is a very just disturbingly low number that I would see if you know. I would definitely want to see that. As far as I know, yes, there's definitely a problem with the unhoused or the unsheltered, not wanting to go into the intake, shelter or 30Th Street. I think we all agree. Why so Jim I mean I guess to answer your question. You know we have breaking ground at our panel next week. Monday and you can. I will ask them that particular question. Okay, are they an outreach group yeah, so the outreach group for from 23rd to 59 to riverton, yeah, okay, I've tried outreach a couple of times. You know nothing happens all right. Thank you. B Disman would like the floor. Yes, so I we're doing an expensive budget for 22.. Am I correct, that's correct and while we're talking about they may be satisfactory now I have big concerns about what might happen in cuts in the budget. So I think in my mind this is continuing expense items to show we're interested in. Since you can't say continue to me, keeping it here shows the community's interest in this area, so I think we should not think about whether things are fully funded now, but kind of try to predict. Also what 22 will look like, and I think we're going to see a totally different picture and unfortunately, homeless and runaway youth always are things that are cut by the city. Interesting, that's a persuasive argument, because it's something that I've been thinking about in other with some of these other ones. One of the things that we have to go to face is that we're not going to get most of what we're asking for. What we really need to do is protect what we've got and maybe protect, maybe get like piddling ones, but we do not usually on in a good year. We do not get much of what we asked for. So let's I still have a little bit of trouble leading off with it as number one, but let's we'll put just let's put a pin in that and come back to where it where it belongs. As we go through, the street outreach we've got. Some language coming in from Corinne has done a good write- up. I think one of the things in particular coin. What we need to do is specific locations if you can like not just Bellevue South Park. I believe that the language is very specific because it was the it was actually written by breaking ground themselves. So it's very clear: there's like a contract attached to it like their own language. There's like a file is that what is that among the stuff that you sent me? Probably not it's just like a file, that's attached to the request. We can try to dig it up and send it to you, okay, cool, just as long as we have a little. I just think we wanted. We do not want to limit it to just Bellevue South Park these days, because I think people want to see the words Turtle Bay. I think they want to see 30th and blacks or whatever someplace on 30th street right. That was the argument. Last year, like it's not really fair, because then you know, why is Bellevue South Park? Getting more attention than turtle bay and even there's definitely it's definitely a valid argument. The response that we had was it will take the pressure off the other teams, so they do not have to go to the Bellevue South Park area so much so they have more time for other areas. Yeah you do not buy it and I'm not sure of the catchment area, but breaking ground has a contract to set the contract with Grand Central B and where grand central bid comes into our community board. They cover that area for homeless. So it may appear in that portion of our district that there's more service going on because they have a separate contract with the bid all right, well I'll, just I'll work on the language- and you know, let's work on the language just so people know we have to we're going to have to approve our our ordering and the language of the budget requests in a separate at a separate time. Now, that's that time officially is going to be the half hour before the board meeting in October, but I will get you the language before that for comment. I I'm not going to just bring it on you at that point and say: we've done all this work here, you go so, but I do think we can rely strongly on Karen's committee members to pull that whole thing together. Okay, so on we go with number three security cameras and these are located at Strauss houses. I do not see anybody have a problem with that. Okay park safety through security staff. This is a park enforcement patrols. Now let me take a experience. Number four. You know I do not know. What's going on here. Pam is basically taking out everything. I do not know what she's thinking is. Pam. Are you here, no pam's not on no pam's, not there, but I would I mean I do not want to speak for her, but as a member of the committee- and I know that the staff had a separate discussion with her this week, but from prior discussions. There were things that were on the park budget for many years right, and she felt that we should take those out because you know to show what our priorities now are: the things that we really want, because these were things that have just been there for years and had not gotten funded. Okay, I mean I if I could speak for a second there about that, the pep officers I can live with removing them, even though I'm not sure that it's a great idea, but right now, when the parks are under severe stress and are likely to be for a continuing long amount of time and already suffering the consequences of that with piled up garbage, I mean all you got to do is walk past the New York Post on any given day to see what it looks like. I do not think that we should give up on the idea of hiring more staff to keep the parks in some kind of condition, if they're usable, because they're under stress, so maybe that could be taken back to the Parks Committee and have it have it run through them and see whether they think that's a good or bad idea, whether they all want to remove it, especially if this is something that Pam was doing with the office yeah. I can check with pam on all of these things. You know when I reach out to her about the Stan Barton Park Dog, Run issue. That would be, if you could do, that would be great the yeah just to let you know, though, so one of the things that the park you know told us at the last parks meeting was they usually have about 1700 people. They hire temporary workers during the summer in the park to do cleanup this year. None of those people were hired because of budget cuts. So that's the I mean, so not only do we need more people, but there's, actually you know additional people that are normally hired have not been you know, so even that might be a request that we need for next summer when Park usage is at its highest. We want to have those people hired that's right. It was the youth services, jobs and all that sort of stuff that the mayor cut. That directly impacted the parks to an even greater extent, yeah see what I'm, what I'm reacting to is that there has been a lot of coverage of the parks getting you know, kind of really a mess, and we know that because of the presence of people who are experiencing homelessness, it's also getting comments up from that regard, that between the security and the cleanliness of the parks, you'd, think and at a time when people are reaching out for green space, where they can actually go and get away from their small apartments during a period of kind of confinement. You'd think this is exactly when you'd want to be advocating that they should be having more people doing the work. Now. I've never understood the art of the argument that, because it's been cut we should not be. We should not bother asking for more for money, I mean if it's been cut, we it's an even greater need as far as I'm concerned, but that's just my opinion. That's not a fiat, but it's it just does not sit well with me when this when somebody says well we're not going to we've been asking for it, we have not got. It does not mean that we give up on it. I think, are you hoping to cross the floor yeah? No, I do not I'm sorry. I was going to say I'd agree with that, and I'd also add that this was mayoral budget cuts which could be restored by rejiggering the money from someplace else, for example during the council's reconsideration of this. If sufficient public pressure is brought to bear something to think about well, and the other thing that we do not always pay attention to is that the city, Council members and the borough president use our district needs statement as support for how they distribute money. So it's quite possible that Keith, for example, might want to give extra money to might want to make a show of support for turtle bay by having more people patrolling Turtle, Bay area. So I do not want to take it out for that reason, but I think we do need it is from the committee so reshma. If you could, you should make that a priority to talk to pam about it yeah. No, I will, and I will mention I think you make a good point- that just because they've made cuts does not mean we do not ask for it right and just because it's been on the list for a long time does not mean we. You know. I corrine has reminded me several times that I've been known to say: you know it takes 10 years to get things done. It does take. It takes a while to get some of these things done. You have to hammer at it and sometimes they come through and sometimes they do not. I'm sorry who brian venuenhoven request the floor. Ryan yeah, I was going to say I was party to communications with pam about our budgeting government priorities process, and my impression of her response is that she does not agree with the premise of what we are trying to do here with this process. So I definitely believe we should leave the items on the list and have reshma and or the office circle back to her and strongly communicate to her that any item that she thinks that would make the district better, including items that are on the list already, should be left on, and we should also discuss specifically the fact that what we're doing is we are advising the city about how to rebound when budget cuts are restored, rather than trying to act like we can just deal with the budget cuts forever. This budget is aiming for a period in time of the city where we will likely have revenue to fund these things. Okay, so we're going to keep those we're going to get more information from the Parks Committee and then we're on to six enhance education, recreation programs, senior facility, providing meals and services. Oh, this is where this is where we start talking about the creative programming. Ozzy. Are you still on? Okay, the if we, this would be the parallel thing to what Ozzie was talking about. So I think we've got. If you look at this one and then at 10, which has to do with home care services there we're look, we're looking at creative ways of providing services to seniors who, for whom it is not safe to necessarily show up in crowds at least not right now so I'd like so we'll keep six we'll enhance educational and recreational programs for seniors if we can find a better request so that seniors are emphasized. That would be nice, but if we can't that's the way it goes Community board staff. I've had a conversation with Jesus about this I'd like to move this down the list, that's not to say that we do not think that the staff should be adequately funded, but this has done a good job of assessing where they stand right now and they stand pretty good. So we would not want to take it off, but we do not need it to be a top 10 item yeah, and I think this also applies to our you know our overall budget and we are looking at rebounding, especially because we had a big haircut this year. Where was the cut in the otps was cut? Oh, that's interesting, pretty significantly, but not to an extent that it would affect we'd, be we'd still be okay, and also we are our non- baseline funding was removed and we want that funding back. Our position was always that non- baseline funding should actually be baselined yeah. Now there's some place. We talked about that the it would be nice to get the baseline funding made part of the budget. They do not have to go any higher, but so maybe as we when we move this down- maybe that's the man, maybe that's the key to focus on getting the baseline raised to reflect the two recent years of increases. Are we sure that this is not? That item, though, I think I think this is the item. I think that yeah, I think the table and the reference name are not communicating effectively that this is yeah in the explanation. It's it talks about, there's been no increase in community board based budgets. Cb6 has advocated for additional base budget funding for community boards in our last, several district needs statements, and it focuses the explanation that we give focuses on based baseline budgeting, but I still think we should put it down a little bit. It looks a little in this particular time. It looks a little self- serving so we will move it down the list, but we won't get rid of it additional traffic enforcement officers. I do not remember looking at this one. Okay, this is a just keep in mind. We only have 20 expense items, so decisions are going to be made to move down the list you're going to end up with everything in the exact same order, because at this point items that also need to go farther yeah. That's a good point. I question whether it's politically appropriate to increase anything having to do with the police department, but do we need additional traffic enforcement officers? One? Yes, two advocates are asking that division to be moved back out of NYPD, so at some point it won't be in NYPD and will probably change the agency. If that gets fulfilled hold on you mean that the traffic safety officers, I think, have always been NYPD. I think you're thinking the school safety officers, which used to be DOE, became NYPD and are now going to go back to DOE. I do not think school safety traffic agents were ever anything other than NYPD traffic control and traffic ticketing used to be handled by D.O.T. I believe I think that D.O.T or whoever, but I thought it was a police agency. There was a group called that was the brownies brownie yeah, because a uniform color right so Rick. I do not think it's material to talk about the political. What might happen? I think if you listen to the transportation, that enforcement officers has always been a major issue, and that's also owens issue that I hear at every meeting. Okay, then we just then we leave it where it is yeah. Okay, Azia body requests the floor. Asia wanted to just add it does. We need we have a need and we would like it to be supported, who actually fulfills a need. The city decides whether it's the NYPD or another agency at another time, that'll be decided right. I mean that's how we do a lot of our yeah. The only thing we have to be careful of is to make sure that we direct the request to the right place yeah after that, after that it does not matter but you're right after that they'll figure it out, but we have to get it to the right people, because it's very easy for them to say: oh, it's not our job and that's why they've done that, so okay provide expand or enhance preventive services. Alternatives for youth! Oh! This is this is the acs item. I would like to just do a little bit of editing in the explanation to point out our particular situation with acs. I do not think that there's enough focus on our district in this write- up and we have some serious issues with acs and it's the implication, partly because they're they've got too many teenagers now and they were not supposed to have teenagers at all. But that means that they have that they're, you know teenagers. Are they cause problems? They're teenagers so anyway, we'll do a little bit of revision of the explanation, but other than that. The item is a good idea. Rick, I have to correct you. They cover from birth to 21.. They tell us what they covered from birth to 21. Oh, my. That's part of the problem that their population in the last couple of years has actually gone down in terms of teenagers in a certain category, but the problem with them is that they do not think outside the box enough to get to handle the problem that they're having they do not stay focused on the problem that is affecting us and the surrounding community by the kids that are in the age group from like 14 to 19. yeah and the problem that we have is that that's not a stable population. So it's a population and movement and we have been pressuring them the last year, the last two years in terms of how they look at that population, how it fits into their overall structure and how they can move a lot of those teenagers outside of that particular area into other locations. That will benefit them so yeah. But you need to know that they cover from birth to 21. and that's a problem because the older kids can walk in and out. They will tell you in a minute they're not up they're, not a prison they're, not a jail, they're free to come and go. I finally figured out how to read my screen. It ozzy has raised your hand thanks Rick. I just wanted to agree with Claude's take on this, and I would also add that the the young youth that we do have here. The acs center has said that they are kids that traditionally would not have come to their center. There are kids where the parents can't even handle them and are can give them to the city to take care of in some ways. I think they use a different term for that, but so they are youth that they are really struggling to take care of, and I think making sure this is part of our budget request- make sure that if it's, whether it's at our center or elsewhere, there's funding for these kids to be supported in the right place and we're making the case too. That right place may be outside of the center yeah good, okay, so we'll play with the language there to make it more. I think to get into some of this stuff rick one thing we need to check because it's been true previous years. The reason some of these may seem not to get into all of the points is because the city has imposed an 800 character limit on these explanations. So that's important that's to be born in mind when reworking some of the texts. Thank you. I meant to ask you that this afternoon it's 800 characters assuming it's the same as last year, then yes, but we'll have to check on that. It probably is okay, okay, home care services, force Rick. I just had one comment on that: oh yes, Jim and it follows up on what claude said it. Why are we moving these kids around? I mean if they're here in the neighborhood, keep them here in the neighborhood through their school years, so that you know they they've got. Some ability to transferring schools is a very difficult and challenging scenario for a lot of children, no matter who they are and the idea of flustering around and moving them from one area to another area. That's ridiculous! Keep them where they are. When they come in our neighborhood keep them in our neighborhood for whatever period of time it needs to get them adjusted, get them into. You know graduation high school, whatever okay well, but that's getting in that's getting into the programming side and not the priority side. So the health and Education Committee has been working with the acs group. There's a there's, a cab associated with that now is not there yeah. Yes, we have a meeting coming up good, okay conduct traffic or parking studies, the area of the queen's Midtown tunnel. Surprise, I think that's sounds like it's still needed any questions. The entrance to the tunnel is going to change dramatically, supposedly starting later this month, when in fact, D.O.T is going to be installing the permanent bike lane there and reconfiguring the entrance to the Midtown tunnel itself. I have absolutely you know that yeah no. I saw something like that. What do you suggest? Then? We do with this. With this item, I'm not sure I mean I'm not sure that I'm not sure how valid it remains. The thing itself is going to is going to change they're going to they're, going to change the entrance itself to cut down they're, going to cut out the slip lane there they're reconfiguring the entrance to lessen the dangers of people making turns into pedestrians and all that sort of stuff. So this was part of the reason that this particular item was asked, for there are always problems with traffic around there, although kind of less right now- and so I do not know what you want to do with it, I'm not sure what the committee would want to do with it, because we did just find this out literally a couple weeks ago. Yeah Rick will remember this is that every year transportation had a budget request for a traffic study of the whole district and long story short. We were told that was not going to work. So now we have a traffic study that we're asking for a part of the district pegged to a specific piece of infrastructure, not just because of the effects of that infrastructure, but because it's kind of a back door way of asking for a traffic study of a slice of the district. We hope that would work, but not only is it kind of not working, it's also. It just keeps getting pushed off, even though there's actual changes happening around there, but the transportation committee's position is that we would want. We want traffic studies to be done. That has not changed, but they do have to be. They have to be specific. This may not be what I'm suggesting is that this may not be the best site for it, since this is already in motion. I do not know if there's if anyone in transportation has a substitute site ready to roll to fill this item, this has become largely kind of mood. That's what I'm wondering is the transportation committee meeting still coming up, or has it passed this month? The next one is October. We already did the September meeting. Yes, by the time this is submitted, it might not even be just moot, it might be the work. A lot of work might be done to make corrections. We can. We can talk with transpo at or we can mention this at at exec later this week and there might be a there might be room for a quick discussion about this, in which case we're still asking for a traffic study. We might recite it if we something comes to us. Oh you have to go through the committee yeah. It would have to the location of where that, where that study would be, would that's a committee decision? I think I think you're going to find out. We can leave it as is or we can ask for a new location, but for our ordering purposes we can leave it at 11, and we can just say I think that's smart, we'll leave it we'll leave it there we'll leave it there. If nothing else, it's a placeholder and we'll deal with it. We got some time still. If we have to okay. Noise complaints, increased noise. We know that noise is like the number one complaint, so we'll keep that you've got specific locations. So that's good job training programs. Where is this coming? What committee is this coming from HR? Is this housing? No, it posted this budget, which granted tends to be a bit of a catch- all for anyone's that do not fit into any of the other communities, at least in the past yeah. That's it that's what we do do we want to keep it or not. I mean it seems kind of odd to me, given the unemployment rate coming out of a lot of these restaurants that are no longer going to be open again, it might be a wise job. Well, as you say, job training is never a lost cause. I mean that's always a good thing. We never got to signal that we had really maxed out on this. So it's one of the reasons it keeps coming. Yeah, let's keep it traffic improvement, requests three one call paving personnel: do you know? Does anybody who's in transportation know? What's going on with this one yeah? It's bad! It's a bad, a bad item or it's a bad situation. It's a bad situation as a matter of fact, two or three weeks ago they milled all of the streets in between second and third avenue in our district and it's just sitting there unpaid it's been milled, but not paved. Oh crap. He has had chronic issues with both the repaving and the repainting and vot has basically claimed that, would they handle it city- wide. They have no need for extra budget and everything is fine. In recent years they started to talk about how or the mayor had said something about increasing the number of units going to be applied to this, but we asked for it in the budget, because we understand that they're trying to skimp on resources and drag things out as long as possible for budgetary reasons, we're asked to throw more money at it so that when they do this stuff, they handle it in a timely manner, including the repainting after the repaving okay, separate item between here and 20. I do not think so. No then this is probably both yeah. That's fine! If we that's fine, we may need to tweak the language a little bit. I just am not I'm not it's not clear to me when I'm reading it what the what's being talked about so maybe just we may need an extra sentence in there. Okay, so elder abuse victims. Do we have a problem with elder abuse in our district? You sure do we do yep? Okay, I think that's what the budget request is for do not figure out the extent of it. Oh yeah, you know you're right. It is it's a survey to make sure to see how bad it is. Okay, yeah! If you look at the date of food city, you do not have very detailed data, but elder abuse is a major problem and it gets even more of a problem when you have the economic situation as it is today right. So I think right on for a survey. Okay, perfect, 16, additional uniformed up officers. We can take this one off because they told us to yeah. This is for the NCO program, which was just instituted, and unless we have a reason to have that specific program increased. We might just be happy with it, as is, and I believe that came from us, so we do not have to check with another committee on that yeah. No, that's good. The other thing is whenever we start mucking around in the police department's hiring practices, we get the same response. They're going to they're going to everything depends on how many people they let into the academy and then they'll assign them where they want to assign them. But in this case we were trying to help them out program's already in place done. If we were doing anything on that, I would suggest additional training for sergeants and white shirts just in terms of de- escalation and things like that dealing with crap yeah. That's where that's where half these problems come up, yeah, okay, so these guys leave the academy and nothing happens afterwards. There's no additional training, yeah okay. So let's keep moving here. Programs in parks and recreation, centers parks, yeah. This is for escr. This is something I know. The host committee feels pretty strongly about: do more outreach and alternative programming at locations, so maybe she changed her mind. Parks, 17 did no. It looks like it's new yeah. It is yeah, it is new because in fact we're facing it now it's going to begin again. I can't I can't pretty much yeah in process. This will be coming our way and they've started to set up additional parklets and some additional stuff, but we need more because, as everybody knows, we have very few. We have very little park space as it is, and we're about to lose a big chunk of it yeah for a while, oh yeah, maybe a year and a half to two years for psycho, and maybe you know, East Village, East River Park is not technically in our district, but everybody here uses it and that's minimum five years and running out yeah. Well, that means 10.. Okay, oh the Landmarks one committee says: take it out, that's fine with me: we've we always get you're not going to get that anyway and extend library hours. I'd. Ask that this got taken back to parks as well to reconsider. Removing this, because, again, the libraries are a tremendous resource for people, the more hours, the more time, the more everything that we can get, especially now they're just invaluable, and so whether or not it's likely we get it. I think we have. We have a duty to push for it and at an agree and at a minimum we should be able to. If we do not have a separate item, we have to at least mention that in the other we have like two other items that are somewhat related, but definitely this is not the time to be cutting back on library services or they already have been they're, not just now, starting to come back. Okay and the last one on this list, the new number one. I am happy to move it up, you know, but we definitely you know, so we certainly can keep it we'll have to change the language a little bit. Well, what's the language? Oh yeah, we're all worried about measles yeah. I do not think it should be measles, but that's a whole other thing. Are you really looking for marketing efforts? Is that what this is about, I think there's a lot of people that are afraid to take the vaccine coming out, presumably, and but I think it's also important- that we get people to get vaccinated for flu, so that they're so that they're differentiated from Covid-19 sufferers. I think, since we're all aging, we can call it shingles yeah. Thank you for calling the age group all I'm asking. This appears to be a communications strategy that we just do communications, so I think it needs to be clearer. Okay, communications, okay and I'd. Kick it up. I do not think I have any additional items. Did you have something? Did anybody have anything that they wanted to add? Then? Okay, we have a relative. We have a couple loose ends here, we'll get them figured out. We've got a strategy to go back to a couple of the committees, get a little bit more information, we'll be beefing up some of the explanations a little bit, but we bait we have our basic ordering, which is the most important thing for us now. What happens next? For those of you who have not been through this? I think we all have been through it is that we get the budget list prioritized approved at the next board meeting the board does not rule on the full district needs statement. The district needs statement will be submitted at the end of October, so the it won't be completed unt at the time of the full board, and we have not ever done it that way anyway. So as long as we get our priorities done we're set and I'm sorry we had to go through this item by item the same way we have in the past, but I think we went faster because of the work that Brian led us through before, and some of the responses from some of the committee member chairs have been very helpful. Is there any? Is there anything else on this topic on the budget on the yes, the budget expense? I would just. I would just perhaps suggest, to the borough president that she had, particularly with the census coming out. You know whatever next 20:21 22, whenever it's published, that she perhaps have training for committee chairs so that they can use the data provided by DCP department of City planning and thereby create more specific budgetary items to make this a rather than just talking spending vectors to talk about specific spending amounts. You know more or less does not really do much in terms of the budget process. If we can, if we can frame this in terms of budgetary, require budgetary requirements in terms of data that we have available from the DCP. That makes us a lot more viable and much more professional, in my view. Well, the other thing that I'd like to do and I'll have to get your all of you to buy into this during the year. I think we need to be more aware, both in our committee and in the other committees of what the district needs have been stated to be and that we're working our way towards those district needs being fulfilled. I think we do this once a year, and then we just sort of set it aside, and it's done we. It could be a really good management tool. That's how we're doing it can be a good pr tool and, to a certain extent, and to show that we really care about these things. We're not joking around, and I just think, and it we really if we keep up with it, it'll be a lot more effective when we get to the end of the this time next year, because we'll be able to have time to find out those dollars. We just can't do it in the last couple weeks. Now, we've never been successful, doing it before, but I'd like to put that out there as something that we should probably be aiming for as a committee, because, if we're going to be a standing committee now, which is the which is the case, we'll have some time in meetings to just periodically just bring it back up and if each of you on another committee, maybe you know we can have somebody from parks be in charge of making sure the parks is staying on track. It's also, of course, a committee chair function. I'd have to work with the whoever the new chair of the of the board is on what we do with that, but I just think we need to make this stock these documents that we work so hard on more effective and useful tools, and not just once a year, do it and put it aside. Okay, now I have to go back to a script here. Hello, we're not we're! Not! Oh I'm sorry did somebody have a hand raised right. This is Eva Lasseter. I just wanted to. I think that's a great idea. I just wanted to know what was the primarily primary problem that this idea and procedure was not effective in the past that perhaps that has to also be reviewed, to make what you're saying more effective in the individual committees. That's what I wanted to know. Okay, that's a good! That's a good follow- up! I have to say that in a large measure when I was chairing the committee in the past, I was a roadblock because I did not enforce it. I did not make it happen. I think what we need to do is just make sure that we do it now I mean it. There is no inherent roadblock to doing it, except the amount of time that it takes and committee chairs sometimes shy away from taking on too much extra, because they're already stressed out with the amount of work that they're asked to do. But if we as a committee can support the work of the individual committee chairs, then you know maybe we can maybe we can actually make it happen. So, let's see we can do we're going to we'll address that after October. Maybe we can start off the calendar year as a as an example and start looking at setting goals for when we get additional information when we follow up with committee chairs and that contact okay sure. So we do not have anything we're going to vote on tonight. We have. We have to get the get in a little better format, but I think we've got the basic idea, so we've gone through. We do have this one other item, discussion of potential resolution regarding government and user privacy. Do I brian this? Was your issue? Can I ask if you would perhaps raise this a different time? We could do a 120 second summary of it and see if we want to advance the work on it. Okay, it's! I would just tell you it's now 905. right now, but go ahead. It's on the agenda, it's up to you to go ahead, so this is not. This is not about the board's operations having a privacy policy. This is instead about us as a board coming acrosss items and proposals in which the city might have might propose to us a program or a vendor which might need to collect user data or somehow monitor users based on the users themselves. Maybe wanting the monitoring or perhaps for a public safety concern or anything like that, so the idea was instead of calculating what the boundaries are or what our desires are. Every time such a resolution comes up, we would draft a kind of a broader resolution that says in general. We think companies that collect user data should delete such data. It would be a little technical in nature, but it could be something where we have a little bit of a guideline and we kind of do our own thing. Where then, when the resolution comes up, we can say refer to our original resolution of privacy priorities as an Appendix to this, so it does not need to be fully written out or decided in the new result. That's it! Okay. What would you like to see happen at this point say that again, what would you like to see happen at this point? This was just for committee feedback. If anybody thinks that this is a terrible idea, I guess speak up. Otherwise it's something where I think we might just take a few months to kind of do some research ask some of the tech, smart people on the board to weigh in see what the city's policies are already on this kind of thing, and then I mean possibly where we're going with this is to affirm current city policy through our board yeah, so rick. If I could just comment on it sure when you do contracts to private vendors and stuff, any at least government agency that I work with, has a set of principles and you're. Not keeping the data for a period of time is really important. So I think the research into this to see what the city is doing is really important, because you'll find these at different jurisdictions and, like I'm sitting here right now, not knowing what the city asked for or maybe we should ask them to expand, but this would be in any contracting that anyone does from a government agency out. So I think it's a good research project and then just people to come back and tell us even what it is. It's a very important issue. This data is retained by certain vendors. That should not be. Can I make a non- debatable motion sure? Can we table this item until November meeting? Well, we would not table it was non- debatable. Second, okay, it's been moved and seconded that we table the topic, all those in favor of tabling until November. Please signify by how do we do this? Just a word of advice: you have to vote to take it off the table as well right well, at the other end yeah, and I think I forget the requirement on that, but I think it's two- thirds maturity. I was not no, it's always never. It's! Never more than 50 for a community Board charter champion roberts, just trying to give us time to understand what it is. That's fine! Oh then, let's just let's just do that, like whatever no emotions on the floor. No, it is true. There's a motion. There's been a second all those in favor of tabling this conversation. This discussion, this item, please say aye: how about that? Okay, nay, all those who opposed no okay, the eyes have it so it's tabled in the meantime Brian, whatever you want to do as far as beginning research is fine with me, but the committee will not be hearing it until after November. Oh yeah, that's fine, but we do have to vote now to bring it back yeah in the future. We will vote in December to bring it back, got it. We just have to take it. Is there any interest we just have to take it off the table when we're ready to take it off the table? Okay, yeah, but we'll look into it, but that does not mean that you can't do some begin. Some research on your own, that's! Well! Nobody was against the idea in principle. That was all I was really asking correct. That's correct! As far as I can tell can I say something: yes, it's Karen yeah. It reminds me of something Jim Collins said when he asked at either a but I guess at a budget meeting or at some meeting what link New, York City was doing with everybody's cell phone, who walked by all of the stations, and so I do think that Brian that there is something there to what Brian's saying. I absolutely agree that it's two and a half hours and my brain is swiss cheese, but I would like to support his attempt to see what's going on with the data. Okay good. I think I think Brian will certainly appreciate that. Okay is there anything else, otherwise, I'm getting ready to. Can I just beg the committee's pen indulgence? Yes, that's. The word I was looking for. My brain is swiss food is swiss cheese too. Just going, would the committee be interested in entertaining something to which I spoke out of at the beginning of this session? We just celebrated 9:11, and you know these guys put their lives on the line. We can not leave them short on their pensions because we were obfuscating the reality and I'm just wondering if the committee would consider I'm happy to write the resolution. If the committee would consider taking up a resolution to the effect that when the comptroller publishes his annual report, which will be in October that he and with the school year, having ended in June that he revised his actuarial assumptions to reduce the assumed, compounded annual growth rate to say five and a half percent, it's just advisory you're saying this is for October meaning the next month. Well, he just getting a resolution out if he, if we can put some pressure on him, he obviously is not going to be able to do it. I guess in October now that you mention that, but we need to start doing this with some sense of reality. I mean the sick. The ten year now is like less than one percent. Last I checked like half a percent which just means all of the investments we have. Are it considerably greater risk? We are making money on it now we do have a higher return now, but that's you know you can't can count on that every year and you can get blown out of the water big time. Okay, you know, you know how I you know how I feel about this. The I do not. This is a very complicated topic that I do not doubt that you know quite a bit about, but that the rest of the committee knows nothing about, and it would take a long time to get us get us up to speed to the point where the committee could everything of national support everything would be explained in the resolution. I I'm very gifted at dumbing things down. One of the things that I will not accept is a resolution that only one person knows understands. No, you everybody would understand it by the time they read the resolution. We do not have a meeting in October and we have a half hour meeting. It's fine, I just wanna, I just to have it taken up. I want somebody in city hall to look at this and say you know what the people are telling us that this is a big deal and it's a concern, but if I may jim, the people are not telling them anything. We have not had any time to debate this. We have not any time to study it. We have not any time to really go through it. You raise it a lot and we disagree about even the validity. I raise it once a year. Now, it's now it's much more critical. Let's kick it farther again. We've been at this for three hours. I do not think I know I do not have the brain to think about that. No we're not going to get anything done tonight. You you've placed it in our awareness and we'll we'll chat about it. Another time, I'm sure, but it's not going to happen in the next couple months. So is there any other older new business, seeing none? I do have a motion to Adjourn so moved. Second, okay, I, the motion to Adjourn, does not require a second. If there are no objections, we'll adjourn the meeting and thank you very much for all for a very long meeting. I'm sorry my first meeting was so long, but you know it's me so, but thank you Rick. Thank you very much. You did a good job rick. Yes, you did a great job, hey paige! Yes, can you hang on for a second? I just want to talk to you about something personal sure. Okay,.
