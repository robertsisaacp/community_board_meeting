Have, you read all those books go to the second slide all right, so this shows the the timeline for our capital projects and, as you can see, we're in the second column at this point with the community board 6 presentation, assuming that you guys like what we're proposing, we would then move on to the public design.
There are many parks within a within a five minute walk of st bartons, but the closest park with similar features is albano playground and it's about a quarter mile to the south So, as steve mentioned at the end of february this year we held a community input meeting, and we explained that the funds we initially had for the multi-purpose area were freed up for use in another part of the park.
We asked everyone to put stickers on the on the plan that we brought with us and, as you can see, these little round, DOT stickers, sort of for the most part are within the playground and among the most common comments we heard at the meeting was a desire for a track that accommodated bikes and scooters, especially since the community expressed dismay over losing the large riding around space they had in the multi-purpose area.
The 2-5 play area located in the center opens up just below There is a generous bike and scooter area just below the new wide entrance to the multi-purpose area and to the south There's more of that bike and screw area along with seating areas and a cozy There's nice play panels that are scattered around the play unit set, and this is the 5 to 12 play layout and the spray shower that you see when you, when you first walk in and has gentle low flow water features for smaller children and that's adjacent right to the plate, equipment for the smaller children.
Four foot steel fence is going to stretch along the entrance that provide a sort of more safer enclosure and it will be, it will allow just one main entry into the playground and a new gate opening and the existing chain link fence will be placed more centrally for ease of access to the multi-purpose area, we'll be placing shade, tolerant and native plants where appropriate on site, and there will be new trees also placed throughout the site, and these new plantings will make a more sustainable site by increasing the permeability by more than double Currently it's about 12 and with our proposed design.
, So I, think I know this area is quite popular for skateboarding and that's mostly because you could kind of grind along these steps so that opportunity will be taken away with the new design, because the spray shower will be at grade you're, a conflict between the ages of the skateboarders and the little kids Usually.
I think we like to keep those those two activities separate just you know, because there is greater speed with skateboards, and you know there might be some type of injury that could be had, but I just also want to mention that the multi-purpose area that is now covered in asphalt there are plans to have that turfed over the synthetic turf So that will also, if you're, if you're, worried about skateboarders using the park in general Second one is I love the security with the one gate.
Okay, mark you had a third question: that's not something we have discussed since the community input meeting, because at that meeting in general, we were wondering what the community most wanted to see within the park That became our main area of focus.
Oh read out the questions, that's good, so one member of the public said, please explain the preschool component of the comfort station Currently there is a preschool within the conversation and as I shown in an earlier photo the two front doors to that preschool face the playground and, as far as I know, I believe one of the women who, when the preschool was at our scope, meeting I think they also use the garden as well is stephanie on the call all right.
We can always have stephanie Give a report to the committee at some point: What we call fixed posts, meaning that they would remain on site throughout the day, but usually generally, between 7 and 3 30 there's many opportunities, and, as I mentioned earlier, we worked with our accessibility coordinator to make sure that they were okay.
and there's also some smaller, more intimate, seating and I do just want to mention that the play area is a half an acre So. There is a garden just to the the south along first avenue, Okay next question: is: there is a requirement in one of the tudor city parks that adults must be accompanied by children?
There be a similar safety requirement in this park?, but as let me clarify, as in terms of the area that we're referring to right now within the dotted lines, the playground proper This person is wondering whether what the timeline is for the start and completion of the park renovation You know by the time this project is ready several months down the road to go to into the bidding process.
Okay I'd like to understand more about the thought to turf over the entire asphalt area , there's less functionality for bike riding ball playing, etc with turf right, and so that is also outside of the scope of the playground, but because that comment came up quite frequently in our community input.
We would need a resolution from you so that we could move the project forward to the public design just very quickly before I get to the final questions, we're still getting a lot of things in the q a feature about the garden, even though correct me That's not within the scope of the project as well as comments about the pickleball I.
Okay I ask because our our full board meets a week from tomorrow and so that then they would be able to vote on any resolution at that time Okay, but we would need the resolution from the committee first right, We can't put everything in into this space If we were to place some more swings within the design, you would lose quite a bit a lot of of play, equipment for the older children or something would have to give you'd either use lose part of the spray shower, which I know was a major request, have a much larger spray shower in that grade or lose an area for biking and scooting and correct me if I'm wrong, but the tire swings allow multiple children to sit in one swing.
We may hit two to three times a week, depending on the volume of garbage that's collected there, we're still able to mobilize and go to our parks, usually daily, with our mobile crews, our biggest issues that we have from a maintenance standpoint, like I, said we did not get any additional staff for our seasonal summer staffing and, of course, we're going through Covid-19, and you know we still get people that get ill, we're not with many people get covered However, it is a possibility and it's a real, realistic situation that we have to deal with until you go through it so from day to day that sometimes causes a little bit of an operational changes or may delay some garbage pickups or something until we can figure out a person's coming in Do. We need to get a second person to take over the garbage route, but we've been over accomplishing that and we've been able to overcome these challenges.
I. Don't think we can fix the sinkhole, but you know maybe with trash and other sorts of things, it's my park day, projects and other such volunteer, work?
I was chair of the board chair of the committee and I wanted to ask steve simon, Okay, so I wanted to say something that I think is really important, given that we have all these budget cuts, given that the city is in bad shape, given that schools are going to open, if you know what those circumstances are going to be, if they're they need outdoor spaces, what kind of outdoor spaces can we provide?
