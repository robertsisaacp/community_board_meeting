If there's time we we interact with the committee, so I'm happy to announce that Anton Muller will be taking the minutes for tonight's meeting, which is very nice of him, and we're going to take attendance and Brendan will call the roll call and when you hear your name, unmute yourself and say present or hear or Yo or whatever moves you So brendon, take it away sure committee members, I will call your name and you will unmute yourselves when your name is called.
All such remarks should be made on the record by raising your hand through zoom, the chat should only be used to alert us to any technical difficulties you're having or to state in writing information like the email address that was already stated aloud on the record during the meeting when a committee member is given the floor to speak, I will identify you and you can unmute yourself so that you can speak.
Would then spend several months working on the contract documents and getting whatever permits are required, and at that point you know, I'm, not sure we would quickly move on to the procurement.
We have the goals, for our project are to provide a flexible space for active play, upgrade amenities to enhance comfort on site and add play opportunities for different age groups and establish a safer site to attract park.
It was known as St Gabriel's park, as was mentioned, earlier, and featured a track field and playground and with the construction of the queen's Midtown tunnel, around 1940, a new street was planned to run through the park, effectively cutting it into two parts.
This year we held a community input meeting and we explained that the funds we initially had for the multi- purpose area were freed up for use in another part of the park.
A few drinks keep that one up and at the end of the meeting we asked the community to choose an area of their greatest interest or reconstruction, and the playground was the most chosen.
We asked everyone to put stickers on the on the plan that we brought with us and, as you can see, these little round, DOT, stickers, sort of for the most part, are within the playground and among the most common comments we heard at the meeting was a desire for a track that accommodated bikes and scooters, especially since the community expressed dismay over losing the large riding around space they had in the multi- purpose.
The access to the multi- purpose area is difficult to get to and traverse because you have to go over a playground, equipment and granite block some safety service, and because there are so many trees, there's really only one area that gets direct sunlight These are the trees, As I, just mentioned, on site, there's about 40.
The spray shower, that is recessed and it is not accessible, and this left image shows the preschool entrance directly acrosss from the playground and the right image shows a six foot perimeter fence around the park and unfortunately.
So, as you walk into the playground, you walk in through a new large welcoming entrance on access with a comfort station and when you enter a large spray shower larger than what is there now becomes a nice focal point.
It's on grade for easier access and to the south is an area for picnic picnicking and to the north, A seating area adjacent to the spray shower and above that is a 5 to 12 play area, and it has many challenging climbing opportunities, as requested by the community.
So there will be a drinking fountain that will be near the playground, entrance, a bottle, filler near the multipurpose entrance And we'll be using the same style bench as what is currently in the park, and we will be placing some new lampposts in a few locations to make the space more evenly lit the materials for the playground are fairly neutral to allow the colorful play equipment to make a big impact.
Steel fence is going to stretch along the entrance that provide a sort of more safer enclosure and it will be, it will allow just one main entry into the playground and a new gate opening and the existing chain link fence will be placed more centrally for ease of access to the multi- purpose.
This, is a view from the new bike and scooter area to the west and another view from the south, just south of the 2- 5 playground and once more the schematic plan Can, you please show the slides for the site?
Okay, ask them yes, and also is there one for the for the play features: What else is included in the spray shower?
Equipment, so that'll be the new 512 play area, because the tire swings there's only three tire swings there presently and they take up a lot of room They require a lot of space.
So now we're able to put all this play equipment in offer a lot more climbing opportunities for play where those swings are currently okay.
You, know I'm, thinking of standards set by like magical bridge and items that they have for their famous design and introduction of revolutionizing playgrounds, and you know it.
We have an accessibility coordinator that we worked with for the design of this playground, so we made sure that there were plenty of play activities for for, say, someone in a wheelchair Lots of it's a little bit hard to see here in this rendering, but there's lots of what they call ground opportunities for play and also the spray shower, which is currently not accessible.
Last thing: I think these are the same play pieces that they presented to us like a year or so ago, where they talked about the caregivers being able to get up to the things.
So I think it's looks like the same stuff, but I'm pretty sure, but the three questions I had were: Is there our age- old issue of skateboarding?
I think we like to keep those those two activities separate just you know, because there is greater speed with skateboards, and you know there might be some type of injury that could be had, but I just also want to mention that the multi- purpose area that is now covered in asphalt.
And I think it was decided we there would not be one here, but have you guys discussed it or thought about it or that's, not something we have discussed since the community input meeting, because at that meeting in general, we were wondering what the community most wanted to see within the park.
Oh yes, they're, going to be placing turf sort of in the concrete Right there in the multi- purpose, area.
Currently there is a preschool within the conversation and, as I shown in an earlier photo the two front doors to that preschool face the playground and, as far as I know, I believe one of the women who, when the preschool was at our scope, meeting , I think they also use the garden as well is stephanie on the call all right.
There are no monkey bars, but there was a quite a lot of requests for more climbing structures, and so we included that in the design of the playground.
Some little seating areas just placed outside of the the playground of those the swings There's a few up here by the multi- purpose.
Okay, next question: is: there is a requirement in one of the Tudor city parks that adults must be accompanied by children?
Okay, I'd like to understand more about the thought to turf over the entire asphalt area,, there's less functionality for bike riding ball, playing, etc with turf right, and so that is also outside of the scope of the playground.
There's, not a lot of space for kids to stand together like they do now on the different levels of the play, space, so This play equipment was also responding to a great need to have more climbing structures and also to have separate play areas for the smaller children and older children.
There are two gates currently at first Avenue at the entrance to the north and to the south Now. There is not a plan to have a gate at the entrance to the playground directly acrosss from the conversation because of the two gates that are at First Avenue to get into the park.
If we were to place some more swings within the design, you would lose quite a bit a lot of of play, equipment for the older children or something would have to give you'd either use lose part of the spray shower, which I know was a major request, have a much larger spray shower in that grade or lose an area for biking and scooting and correct me if I'm wrong, but the tire swings allow multiple children to sit in one swing.
What is in the areas to the side of the comfort station outside the playground.
I would like to make sure that there's language on any sort of updates on having micro, bacterial surfaces, protection on all the surfaces you know, If there's this equipment is all commercial and for anything that is all these new, updated.
We still have some debris, they've been prioritizing their work based on the the danger and in many cases a lot of people do not understand that you know we were checking.
I do not think we've itemized it by district, but the most significant issue you know, which is obvious to us during the summer, is that we were unable to hire our seasonal workforce roughly 1700 people that we depend upon to keep our parks clean and maintain them during the heavy usage of this the summer season.
I did not say that I thought it was in danger of falling, so I called back and said that I thought it was in danger of falling and in two days somebody was here and the tree was gone, so I think it depends on how you report it and what kind of danger you see I want to know.
Let's then, move on to the to old, business, and You want to give an overview and then say what you said: What you're talking about so I'd be happy to so a community board member asks the committee to address the topic.
What I'm going to suggest is that we table I think that we need a table and look at it, some more because there's a So Let's table this discussion until such time when it either comes up again or when we have a clearer mind to like address it.
You know, work on that with parks with D Cass and with who whoever comes and starts presenting playgrounds and any sort of updates where the public is involved, that they too know that Cd6 has you know a certain standard and do not bring anything.
