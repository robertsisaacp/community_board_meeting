If there's time we we interact with the committee, so I'm happy to announce that anton muller will be taking the minutes for tonight's meeting, which is very nice of him, and we're going to take attendance and brendan will call the roll call and when you hear your name, unmute yourself and say present or hear or yo or whatever moves you So brendon, take it away sure committee members, I will call your name and you will unmute yourselves when your name is called.
All such remarks should be made on the record by raising your hand through zoom, the chat should only be used to alert us to any technical difficulties you're having or to state in writing information like the email address that was already stated aloud on the record during the meeting when a committee member is given the floor to speak, I will identify you and you can unmute yourself so that you can speak.
So there are several members: There are several people from the parks department here, but the main one presenting from my understanding is benjamin nicolsi.
We're glad to be back at community board six to present another project to improve one of your parks.
Benjamin would then spend several months working on the contract documents and getting whatever permits are required, and at that point you know, I'm, not sure we would quickly move on to the procurement.
We have the goals, for our project are to provide a flexible space for active play, upgrade amenities to enhance comfort on site and add play opportunities for different age groups and establish a safer site to attract park.
It was known as st gabriel's park, as was mentioned, earlier, and featured a track field and playground and with the construction of the queen's midtown tunnel, around 1940, a new street was planned to run through the park, effectively cutting it into two parts.
As steve mentioned at the end of february this year we held a community input meeting and we explained that the funds we initially had for the multi-purpose area were freed up for use in another part of the park.
We asked everyone to put stickers on the on the plan that we brought with us and, as you can see, these little round, DOT, stickers, sort of for the most part, are within the playground and among the most common comments we heard at the meeting was a desire for a track that accommodated bikes and scooters, especially since the community expressed dismay over losing the large riding around space they had in the multi-purpose.
Access to the multi-purpose area is difficult to get to and traverse, because you have to go over a playground, equipment and granite block some safety service, and because there are so many trees, there's really only one area that gets direct, sunlight, As, I, just mentioned, on site, there's about 40 that can be seen here around the playground and most are in healthy condition.
And we'll be using the same style bench as what is currently in the park, and we will be placing some new lampposts in a few locations to make the space more evenly lit the materials for the playground are fairly neutral to allow the colorful play equipment to make a big impact.
Steel fence is going to stretch along the entrance that provide a sort of more safer enclosure and it will be, it will allow just one main entry into the playground and a new gate opening and the existing chain link fence will be placed more centrally for ease of access to the multi-purpose area, we'll be placing shade, tolerant and native plants where appropriate on site, and there will be new trees also placed throughout the site, and these new plantings will make a more sustainable site by increasing the permeability by more than double.
Equipment, so that'll be the new 512 play area, because the tire swings there's only three tire swings there presently and they take up a lot of room They require a lot of space for safety, reasons.
You know I'm thinking of standards set by like magical bridge and items that they have for their famous design and introduction of revolutionizing playgrounds, and you know it swings, And I, don't see anything for if there's a caregiver to be next to like a person coming down to catch that participant because they may not be just all those kind of considerations.
So I think it's looks like the same stuff, but I'm pretty sure, but the three questions I had were: is there our age-old issue of skateboarding?
I think we like to keep those those two activities separate just you know, because there is greater speed with skateboards, and you know there might be some type of injury that could be had, but I just also want to mention that the multi-purpose area that is now covered in asphalt there are plans to have that turfed over the synthetic turf.
Somebody a long time ago brought up the dog run issue That's, not something we have discussed since the community input meeting, because at that meeting in general, we were wondering what the community most wanted to see within the park.
Currently, there is a preschool within the conversation and, as I shown in an earlier photo the two front doors to that preschool face the playground and, as far as I know, I believe one of the women who, when the preschool was at our scope, meeting , I think they also use the garden as well is stephanie on the call all right.
And I do just want to mention that the play area is a half an acre, There is a garden just to the the south along first avenue, : is: there is a requirement in one of the tudor city parks that adults must be accompanied by children?
Okay, I'd like to understand more about the thought to turf over the entire asphalt area,, there's less functionality for bike riding ball, playing, etc with turf right, and so that is also outside of the scope of the playground.
We would need a resolution from you so that we could move the project forward to the public design.
Ask because our our full board meets a week from tomorrow, and so that then they would be able to vote on any resolution at that time.
Okay, but we would need the resolution from the committee first right, no from the board.
If we were to place some more swings within the design, you would lose quite a bit a lot of of play, equipment for the older children or something would have to give you'd either use lose part of the spray shower, which I know was a major request, have a much larger spray shower in that grade or lose an area for biking and scooting and correct me if I'm wrong, but the tire swings allow multiple children to sit in one swing.
They've been prioritizing their work based on the the danger and in many cases a lot of people do not understand that you know we were checking.
And, then we're going through and making sure that people have access to their doorways, That were, could fall or could injure, We do have a few limbs and brush piles that we need to remove, but most of the dangerous work has been done.
This is a project, that's in the design process, So we don't know yet whether we're gonna run up against a Covid-19 issue when we're ready to when we're ready to proceed.
I. Don't think we've itemized it by district, but the most significant issue you know, which is obvious to us during the summer, is that we were unable to hire our seasonal workforce roughly 1700 people that we depend upon to keep our parks clean and maintain them during the heavy usage of this the summer season.
I didn't say that I thought it was in danger of falling, so I called back and said that I thought it was in danger of falling and in two days somebody was here and the tree was gone, so I think it depends on how you report it and what kind of danger you see, I, want to know.
I was chair of the board chair of the committee, and I, wanted to ask steve simon, if he's related to paul Okay, so I wanted to say something that I think is really important, given that we have all these budget cuts, given that the city is in bad shape, given that schools are going to open- If they're they need outdoor spaces.
Let's then move on to the to old, business, and So a community board member asks the committee to address the topic.
What I'm gonna suggest is that we table I think that we need a table and look at it, some more because there's a So Let's table this discussion until such time when it either comes up again or when we have a clearer mind to like address it.
