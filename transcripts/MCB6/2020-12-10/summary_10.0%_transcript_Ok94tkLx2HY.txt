The agenda for tonight's meeting was distributed ahead of time by the board office, was posted online and appears on the screen before you.
I want to thank this board for taking a principled stand on supporting the homeless and what you've been.
Thank your chair for the statement that he put out and just we work very closely with our borough President Gabriel, to provide additional services, particularly on the east side and parts of the city that we are able to do more and to do our fair, share.
Gail is a sponsor of the legislation, I believe, which we actually passed into the law to make outdoor dining permanent, we're working on making cultural streets available for folks as we get back to the pandemic.
So we're getting reports of people rationing at public, housing, Sorry, public hospitals, if you know, if you are a doctor or health care professional- and you are being asked to ration.
Are there any questions for the council member all right, seeing none very easy night for you, borough, president Brewer, Would you like to speak now or during the borough president's report.
There's some suggestions in addition to what we are going to be asking for, Let us know also on transportation, helicopters and I, assume that there are complaints to Jesus Perez and the board, as well as others.
I've been working with Times, Square alliance, the great Tim, Tompkins and others, and again I think you have been discussing it in your committees.
You haven't already gotten it that we're sending to the mayor and we are going to keep focus on it, You know that February 1st, all of the applications for community board for current members and I hope you reapply as well as new members are due.
And they're about 63 64 housing, homeless, At least a lot of hotels are going to be in trouble, not all, but some, and perhaps at the silver lining, to work with the non-profit community and the city to purchase some for quality, Maybe senior housing, that's a feeling that generally fits with hotels, religious task force, we're working on for what can happen to the buildings.
The same thing is that people go to the provider, help or otherwise that they were working with before I need more information and also I'd like to know specifically.
Everyone, it's a pleasure being here, thanks for hosting us, I am coming in a representation of Nyu Langone and I would like to talk to you about our projects with the vaccine.
And I think we have seen this year how society has been dysfunction in many ways, not only from the economical perspective, but there are many other issues that are just like out of control because of lack of control of the actual pandemic, reduce the extra burden of the disease as having people already facing disparities, and also to increase the chance of everyone to enjoy healthy and health and well-being.
Of, course, I, know we're discussing with our new health committee ways that we can work best together moving forward and to have.
Any questions or comments from members of the board or from the public on the presentation we just received I see that Senator Hoyleman said that he participated in the Pfizer vaccine at Nyu. All right I do not see any other questions or comments.
So that's going to be a very important message: Kyle that we need and the community board needs to get out to the general public as we ramp.
And, frankly, distribution is a very key question and you know I support efforts by this, the city and the state to ensure that the most vulnerable communities receive the vaccine first and that in particular, communities of color, which have been most you know, hardest hit by Covid-19, received priority.
We're not gonna, be able to do it all ourselves, but we need to understand what we can do in the state of New York, because cutting essential services, you know, like homeless, shelters like mass transit, like public schools, is just unacceptable, so I'll be working on that with my colleagues in brighter news.
A shared sacrifice model that we instituted whereby the small business owners will be paying in rent a certain percentage of their receipts, and that's so important because you know foot traffic has slowed to almost non-existent on some days in grand central it seems, and so we need both the landlord.
Actually, my colleague, particularly in this environment, yes, my assembly, colleague, Harvey Epstein, carries the version in the other house, so we're working on that I also carry a bill that was highlighted in the New York Times.
We have assembly member court, Thanks Kyle good evening to all I know.
It's been talked about by my other colleagues in state government and the multitude of reasons why we need new revenue, irrespective of what happens at the federal level but of acute problem.
We rethink what it is to go to work in the Midtown business, district and elsewhere, So to keep in mind all of the reasons why we need new revenue both from the federal government but also in and of itself at the state government, The funding of our buses in subways is really on the line and in as perilous a condition as I've seen in my 10 years of office.
Let's, move on to Madeleine from Senator Kruger's office, hi, everyone, it's Madeline from Senator Kruger's office, Kyle, Senator Krueger, thanks Community Board, six for their leadership with homelessness, while representing the community regarding the Renwick hotel, like Senator Kruger's.
Colleagues have mentioned, The members are spending much of their time preparing for the upcoming legislative session, which could be at the end of this year or the beginning of the new year and, As a month has passed since the big election.
The corporate transparency Act is likely to be passed in an upcoming vote before this congress is over her legislation for a Smithsonian women's museum was passed unanimously in Senate Committee, which is uncommon right now, and she voted alongside colleagues to pass the marijuana, opportunity, reinvestment and expungement act along with colleagues in the New York delegation, Congresswoman Maloney pushed for an emergency MTA funding.
The university can be on MTA, not asking every time funding or like stand in government funding because will be more common sense if all New York city can be on the MTA and not just wasting money.
My name is Patrick Hill, I'm, the new community liaison for Community Board, six in council member Powers, Office.
You know our office is still monitoring the state of the coronavirus and keeping track of the infection rates, as we deal with the second wave of sorts first wave second wave, and we continue to ask that all fellow New Yorkers continue to follow.
In regards to a quick legislative update, We are working with the mayor's office, other council members and state representatives to address solitary confinement as Friday Councilmember powers in his role as chairperson of the Criminal Justice Committee will be chairing a hearing specifically dealing with how to address and solve solitary confinement.
Looking for the information, If you're able to please consider making a donation to those in need, and, as I said, I'll post those links to the chat, If there's any issues or concerns that anyone would like to follow up with our office on, please feel free to reach out.
And, I, think that is where I'm going to obviously shares the previously mentioned concerns on budget raising additional revenues, protecting the MTA from these doomsday budget cuts and a lot of other issues, but I won't go into those at length, happy holidays, everyone and Congratulations Kyle.
Yes, I can hear you wonderful, I, First of all want to thank the community board for their time and their dedication.
If we don't speak out and ask the right questions, we're condoning that this is the right thing and that we should have the Renwick turned into a shelter for Murray Hill.
We know that our politicians had no idea, and no one had looked at the infrastructure issues to see if we could even support the homeless.
It was poorly communicated and we were given inaccurate, fair share information that has now been updated and will be updated again because the city has said that they didn't have the right figures and at a November 16th meeting we were told that it was a done.
The next person on the list to speak, is Kristen Kliegerman, who is representing the group Save Murray Hill, and she is speaking on the opening of a new apartment, homeless, shelter in our district Mississippi.
After this it's been a busy night, but I know she wants to talk to the board and make sure that she talks public session.
You were talking about Copa the community opportunity to purchase act, which I think is going to be really important, coupled with community land trusts, and, of course, trying to figure out how we can support people experiencing homelessness.
You know that's just some of the things that I'm working on I don't want to take any more time.
So I want to just thank you for your courage and your honesty and everything that you have done, and especially for particular community board members who have taken leadership on that I I've.
I don't want to single anyone out, because then you might know who my favorites are, but this board has been really instrumental in pushing some issues forward and again, really looking at it through equity, so whether that's transportation or housing or small business support.
So I'm going to be really brief, so the community opportunity to purchase act, I think you'll might be speaking about it.
Typically, When you have a vacant, land or land for sale, Larger corporations are able to buy it because they just have a more sophisticated operation and though we find that when you have a non-profit entity like Cooper Square, Mutual Housing Association, once they have that land they're managing, it has been proven to stay affordable with both residential and commercial spaces, and so they also have a community land.
The next speaker is Kristen Kliegerman, who represents the organization, save Murray Hill, and she is speaking on the opening of a new permanent homeless shelter in our district Ms Kleegerman.
Looking for facts, submitting a FOIL request meeting with politicians and have come up with a lot of interesting things, I'm, going to share two discoveries, and then one observation and that'll be all the RFP process that is used by the department of Homeless services allows that department to negotiate with distressed property owners, most often hotel, owners.
We, The citizens of New, York City, Don't have any idea who's offering their buildings to the department of Homeless services and what kind of deals they are.
As a result, the locations of shelters in New, York cities are based on real estate deals, not necessarily on need, it's kind of stunning.
If you think about it, and to that point my second fact that we discovered was that it was perfectly illustrated when we said show us the data, how the Renwick hotel is the perfect location for the department of Homeless, services.
We have Melissa Cohen, who is a resident of Murray Hill and speaking on the opening of a new permanent homeless shelter in our district.
So I'd really like to thank the community board for allowing me to speak on this issue.
And I really want to start off by saying that my objection to the addition of a permanent homeless shelter at the Renwick in no way stems from a lack of compassion for the homeless population or from a feeling of NIMBY-ism.
Continuing to ask me for money and berating me with language that I'm certainly not going to repeat here, but it actually took another passer by intervening on my behalf, to get him to leave me alone and the second anecdote would be about a month and a half ago my daughter needed to drop something off at night at a friend's building.
She is a resident of Murray Hill and she is speaking on the opening of a new permanent homeless shelter in our district.
Who, from the city, will be making sure residents core and security guards comply with safety regulations and treatment regimens for the residents on an ongoing basis, not just this December and January, but for the next year, two years, five years in my experience, living in a HUD building at one point, I discovered that over time the regulations were no longer being enforced by the people who were supposed to be enforcing them.
Next, up on the list is William Leeds, a resident of Murray Hill speaking on the opening of a new permanent homeless shelter in our district, hello, Community Board, Yes, okay, great well.
I. Mean homeless, need a neighborhood that starts to recognize, them, know them and treat them as human beings.
Next person on the list is Peter Harrison, who is a resident of this district and is speaking on the opening of a new permanent homeless shelter in our district hi good evening, everybody Happy Holidays Kyle.
I just want to say thank you to everyone on CB6 who has come out vocally and supported homeless, New Yorkers and the need to be housed safely during a pandemic.
I just want to say that you know I've heard certainly from folks tonight in good faith and elsewhere about this issue across the city.
And I, Think, that what we have to remind ourselves about here is two things one is we are in the state of the pandemic at the moment, and we need folks to be housed.
What I would say to everyone here in good faith, who is opposed on whatever grounds good or not against a shelter, is to think about being proactive about permanent solutions, support, politicians and policies that actually solve this problem by creating enough supportive housing and permanent, affordable, housing, Carlin Rivera was just talking about community land trusts and Bernie.
Please I encourage all of you to come to those meetings to support those policies where the folks that do need the services for mental health for addiction for job training can get them.
If all of us can agree that a shelter in a hotel during a pandemic is not a permanent solution, let's work together on making sure that permanent solutions are enacted and passed.
And I encourage everyone very specifically to participate in the tax, the rich campaign in Albany right now to get funding from the wealthiest members of our community to pay for permanent housing and other types of supportive services.
All right next speaker is Mr Felix Guzman, who is a community organizer with vocal New York speaking on the opening of a new permanent homeless shelter in our district, hello, everybody.
In fact, If you were to look up any of the score cards for repairs and or talk to any of to members of the homeless, organizing community, you would actually hear that pro core services is actually one of the better providers, as is project renewal, which is taking the city by storm.
We are failing the homeless and the city of New York's, residents, All shelters should have resources available within walking distance, a phone call away a stone's throw away every person in a home, every homeless person in shelter could be placed into an apartment if we were to actually allocate the funds away from just throwing them at shelter providers and looking to provide affordable, safe, housing.
You continue the conversation working with our board in partnership and at our committee, meetings.
So I want to congratulate all of the new leaders on our board and look forward to the work that we're going to do together.
As, many of you saw, I, immediately put out a statement that first of all backed the work of our community board members but, more importantly, condemning actions like this.
And, just you know numerous people throughout the public stood in solidarity with our community board members at the time it was only a few it has grown since then to a couple more and so to see the solidarity that we've seen from our elected officials, particularly the borough president's office who's, been handling this in the legal work on it and elevating it.
Big thing that I would like to highlight is that there are some inconsistencies in the way this issue is talked about again, as I mentioned at the beginning of this meeting.
The inconsistencies that we've seen in the harassing letters, the false information that CB6 made some decision on this matter is absolutely false, and the proposed the proposal for the shelter is that it will be renovated to address the needs of the individuals that are being served so to think that it's remaining a hotel or in that capacity is also inaccurate, And. The last thing I want to mention is that the letter also reestablishes our and reiterates our values to people who are in need who are in support.
So I want to make sure that is on the record and that we are vocally saying that, and that was also included in the letter as well, and that we appreciate all the work for people on the ground who are working with these populations, who are working with people in need and providing them with the services they need and that the community board is always open to people of all voices and to partnership.
Of course, It is a competitive process, but I want to make sure that one of the things that I promised coming into this new leadership role was to really you know, conduct outreach on engaging with communities and people who aren't necessarily represented on community boards, particularly with young people.
This ballot, select your name from the list of board members and select your vote on each resolution as it is presented, do not hit submit until later in the evening after the final resolution has been presented at the end of the meeting.
Public schools and the chancellor has said that he will let us know by the end of the year what that plan will be, and then the other question on people's minds is what's going to happen with the specialized high school admissions test, whether it's even going to be held and last night at his town hall, which we announced at our committee meeting, The chancellor said that he's going to let the science be his guide as to whether there will be a specialized high school admissions test.
I'm going to basically just stop there, because what I want to do with the new committee as constituted is define a role for a community Board Education Committee with so many different advocacy groups at work in the city right now.
Thank you Kyle, and thanks for the new name and the committee status, we had a really good meeting last week and discussed a lot of our ongoing work, mainly around the msbi site and the Perlman Place website, which was launched or which was announced in the CB6 newsletter last week, as well.
We are going to be sending out some more announcements and targeted emails to elected officials, stakeholders, community organizations and such and trying to organize a set of potentially collaborative and joint meetings going into the new year, which I'm working, on, I'll.
Be, doing some outreach and hopefully working with you Kyle on that as well on some strategy around that and hoping to have issues and topics to focus on some of the things that came up today, especially with affordable housing and health.
There's a lot more work to be done going into the new year.
I think you're having an audio issue because it says you're unmuted, but I can't hear you know what we'll do.
I, just Jeffrey Selen, one of our public members is, and me worked on a resolution in support of the legislation that council member Rivera just mentioned.
Okay, important thanks Cody and this resolution urges the City Council to pass and the mayor to sign the community opportunity to purchase Act. This provides a right of first refusal and a right to match.
I, don't understand why these community land trusts or anyone else should have a right of first refusal given by legislative, fiat, I think it's unconstitutional on its face.
The law expires at the end of this year and the thought behind allowing it to expire is that once the current, the way it works is that the tax liens are sold to a private trust and then the private trust, which is managed by Bank of New York Mellon.
I think we want to say, supports the exploration and urges the city Council to not renew, which echoes the name of it and otherwise.
Definitely, together with a which, by the way, I, noticed that Katie from Rivera's office offered to address Jim's question or concern at any time that he wants to.
The, Manhattan community board, supports the expiration of and urges the city Council to not renew the tax land sales.
We will ask for your vote verbally during the second roll call, While they do that, you want to talk about five or four c.
Language be changed to members of the assembly and the New York State Senate to support.
Then we have to say our state representatives exactly as Lou stated yep members of the assembly and of the New York State Senate, so I need to add a clarifying question speed, because snap is a federal program and it looks like there was legislation introduced in the Senate in the house.
You, know essentially the eight plus years since Sandy and their general outreach and other sorts of communication efforts during that time, and so DCP, presented to our committee in a public hearing on November 23rd.
I'd, like to think with the recent resolution that you've voted on, but not submitted.
We, know very little about how that's going to work.
You know I want to thank everybody for that.
If you're using the digital ballot, It will ask for your vote verbally during the second roll call, All right.
If, you're interested come on by last time, We had about 80 people signed up for the meeting, so you know we encourage big crowds.
Gene I was just gonna, say that I think you need to focus on more things, but I appreciate it next, not all going to happen next month.
Yes, all right, just seeing no questions, let's move to our ballot, So please go to your digital ballot and mark your vote for this resolution.
This is 8 a and do not hit, submit and again, If you're, using the digital ballot, we will ask for your vote verbally during the second call, all right and then Kevin.
Our city has changed, our neighborhoods, have changed, and so I want to first and foremost thank the board staff for all of the work that they have done it borders on miraculous, if not miraculous, itself, to be able to transfer all of this work remotely to continue these conversations and our efforts seamlessly as we've, you know, continued to remote programming.
This pandemic has affected each and every one of us in ways that you know we can never fully express or quantify or describe, and so to continue this work of being part of this community board of focusing on the future of our district to remain optimistic in times that are pessimistic, really speaks a lot to the character and devotion and commitment of each and every one of us, and so I want to.
There's a lot for us to do as we've heard from all of the committee chairs and of all the issues that we've faced, and so you know I'm, looking forward to that energy.
And I just want to thank everybody and express that in the holiday season, as we wind down the year, all right so has everyone submitted their ballot.
You have not submitted your ballot, Let me know, and I'm happy to take your votes on the phone on the Zoom, Kyle Present.
I. Don't know why space bar didn't work: okay, great Luciki, here, President, Lou. You need any help filling out your ballot or are you.
