Thank you to the board office for honing their fine craft in and in orchestrating and monitoring and conducting these large meetings, and so with that said, we're going to hear from about We will then open up to the committee members who have a chance to discuss, ask questions etc, and then.
There are any questions that don't get answered, you know, for the sake of time, please email the board office at help at cbsix.org, at cvla community board six.
Is the grand central train shed rehabilitation project, so this project is adjacent to cb6 You know it's a community asset that a lot of us use- A, very big role in our recent work within the Midtown east freezoning, So with that, we've asked them to do a very brief update, a broad conceptual overview of the project.
I'm, director of tunnels, bridges and track in the which is a structural engineering department in the capital engineering department of mta, metro, north railroad , we're now part of the construction and development group, I'm, accompanied by wayne ventura north at tonya, cocarina who's, the project manager for the department mark mannix senior director for community affairs, among other things and zeona rubin who's.
So here we just have some quick facts: grand central is the world's largest train terminal at 30 acres over 750 000 people pass through every day and one acre of park avenue malls, sits on top next side and now pass it over to project manager.
You can see a quick section cut through the section one sector, one area: You can see that we have two levels of the train shed at this location and the highlighted portions, where we, where we will be removing the street, the deck, the sidewalks and the steel structure that supports the park, avenue and side streets.
We are currently working with new york city D.O.T and the mayor's office capital project development, team, And, I, understand the D.O.T- is on the call tonight and can also answer any questions that anyone may have.
You can see that we hntb is coordinating with all these parties, the players who are performing the designs, as well as the owner of metro, north railroad, and we are dealing with all state government officials, as you can see, here, slide please and then just just an extension expansion of those individual entities that we're working with, and we have been meeting with all of these and continue currently And, we'll be meeting with all of these third-party stakeholders throughout the life of the program, and we look to get input from the very organizations that we are impacting so that we can continue to coordinate and provide maximum efficiency.
The intent here is to do as much work as possible subgrade so that when we get above grade on to the street and the sidewalks, we are minimizing the amount of time we will need to perform that work, which has a greater impact on the community sector.
These are dynamic structures that will move around the site with, as the work progresses, delivery access to buildings will be maintained whenever possible, with nighttime, shutdowns and switchovers coordinated with the building and area stakeholders.
Construction equipment, such as cranes and concrete trucks, and other deliveries will be situated on side streets that are adjacent to the work areas.
As, we know, the area, stakeholders and metro north is actively coordinating with building owners and key stakeholders to deliver in-kind or enhanced site restoration with respect to the various site.
You talk about pedestrians, you know and building access, but I feel like you could give us a little bit more information about okay.
You refer to the sector, one layout, it's a rather large area and what we are now doing is working with the the jp morgan chase So, as we start to finalize the actual staging, because we're not going to be taking the entire viaduct loose structure off at one point in time.
All of this has to be coordinated and approved with new york city D.O.T that is currently being finalized for sector, one which we'll be able to dice up into several smaller sections and get approvals to move temporarily move traffic, and we will be happy to share that information once it becomes finalized all right, larry.
What's it going to look like compared to now when you're done waterproofing that area Right now we're working closely with D.O.T on that final out layout And, we're concentrating our efforts to make certain that the viaduct is built, Larry, good evening, I'm, jennifer, santinas, I'm, the Manhattan deputy borough, commissioner, with the new york city department of transportation.
On this complex, very high profile project D.O.T, has been developing a public portal that we're looking to launch soon, I'm, looking to looking forward to circling back with the stakeholders and the community boards, hopefully in short order to hear what folks would really like to see as the malls come back online, so whether that includes pedestrian cycling, landscaping, enhancements, I, think we'll have a lot of input once that time, comes, and so we have larry, asked the first question of the public, comment, and so I asked the second sort of the most pressing like will.
We are going to hear from EDC regarding this project update if, after their presentation, we're gonna turn it over to our committee meeting.
I'm joined here by catherine probilski from abc's capital construction team, as well as rob reed from skanska, who was the project manager for the east, Midtown greenway project, so catherine is going to share her screen here momentarily, but we're really looking forward to giving you all an update.
As you know, we're going to be linking via a an elevated, waterfront, esplanade, 53rd street and 62nd street beneath the queensborough bridge between community boards.
The governor issued an executive order in that paused all non-essential construction work, including this project, which we began after a groundbreaking last November 2019 we began So construction was unfortunately forced to pause due to Covid-19 during the in the lead up to the to the city budget process of the budget, Passes for the fiscal year, beginning July, 1st.
We are able to move forward with this project at this time, but we didn't receive that authorization until probably about just a month ago or so, in working with city hall and OMB in terms of getting new pro or getting existing projects.
So, this diagram here indicates the design of the greenway esplanade greenway from the alaska pavilion there at 60th street south to the end at 53rd, street, and then the pedestrian bridge that will cross the fdr drive at clara coffee at east 54th street we've presented the detailed design before to this community.
This is an existing picture, photo representation of the new bridge over the fdr, and so the important bits for you, I'm sure schedule and as we start the work as mentioned, we had started the work in the north and 60th street, and so that work is restarting, is restarting now And, then we're looking to start the work in sutton place: park.
There is obviously protection of the site and installation of traffic and pedestrian protections, and then there is significant work for sewer connection and reconnection around the ramp structure.
The work in the park will start this fall later in October, as we mentioned.
What I'm calling area one right, now, it looks like the bridge would be placed after the foundation work later next year, and The park, as we have talked about, would be closed for approximately a year to do this work and that would include the renovation of the replacement of benches and planting and the repaving of the pathway, and then the greenway itself.
So, yes, we do have the previous allocated funding, but there is no additional right and if I can add one thing adam and thank you, catherine for that, I think you know the I do want to make the distinction as well between project capital, funding still being in the budget and perhaps pushed out a bit versus you know the cash on hand, cash rate, budget.
The condition at 53rd street is one of the reasons that of how we've structured the location of the bridge and the ramp, because it is a for the exit for the fdr Mention too, that the bike traffic from 54th street and then coming off of the esplanade is, would be routed north to 55th street.
The park is small, there's not a whole lot of real estate and really to build both the subsurface structure of the sewer work.
Then the adjacent street has some limited, lay down area that DOT has provided, but a lot of their material will have to kind of come in on the day to be used in the ground, because the real estate there is so small.
We would kind of work wise to make sure that there's notice there, but also that it really is in the best interest of the project and for the community.
There are none from the committee currently they're wondering what consideration was given to pedestrian access from the bridge, which is now very close to the garage exit sure so during the design process, both with our with stantec, who was our design engineer and landscape architects, as well as with DOT and parks.
You know the work here in area, one as I mentioned, we'll be starting it'll, be the pile work and pile worth moving south and then pile work out here, so that the bridge has something to sit on and then building out the esplanade and then essentially because this is a long, linear, piece.
We are working to minimize like the time lag between like when the esplanade is essentially done and andrew green is essentially done, but they're We don't want to be sending traffic over new components as much as possible.
We obviously want to be as clear and transparent and upfront regarding the construction activities that folks should anticipate in the area It moved down a little bit, I'm going to put the website within edc's website that has all of the presentations we've given to date on this project, as well as the contact email address for this project.
If there's anybody's questions that we weren't able to get to understand, there's a packed agenda, but I'm happy to follow up later on I 'll just quickly to, though the in the park, the fencing, like, I, said that will take like approximately to really get the fencing fully installed and then the first work will be the well the protection and removal of the armillary sphere, obviously, in those components and the sewer work, which will be the to start in November and it'll run through November into December.
Kind of what the air that first work looks like And, then the pile work in the south we'll start the north will start to move south, and that is all in water, construction, components.
So with that said, we are going to move on to the next item and the agenda, which is another update on the waterfront this time for the department of design, construction on the east, side, coastal resiliency, so a little bit further to the south.
The community Striping everything will look nice and clean and then nobody's supposed to dig in that road for four years once we finish it, so nothing makes me more upset than to finish a road, and then I come by like two weeks later , We take a lot of pride in it.
So, that's like our center of our project, not physically, but that's where you know the most important area We also had quite a bit of work on 33rd street.
Third avenue: That's 36 inch water main, which we're planning to start in November on third ave, where right now we're doing some STEAM work down on 33rd and 3rd.
The big green bubble to the right, which was gas work, so we were able to pull up all the equipment and the protective barricades we had in the street, and then we got a little help from mother nature.
Any time, we've been in talks with D.O.T about putting a dedicated bike lane in that area, and I know they're trying to come up with a plan right now, but you can see the red lines on 2nd avenue from 34th to 36th.
Now we're choosing a new location for some of the water mains, and we have to go in and do some testing and see if those locations pan out, so it stinks it's kind of time consuming You know, people see us coming back to the same spot and say geez, you guys were just there.
There's, a city crew going through right now doing some sewer work on 33rd street And I saw some people out there.
I'm vice chair of the transportation committee, and we were just reassured by DOT yet again that they're going to begin working on that second avenue bike lane by the end of this month, which the last time I looked, is tomorrow.
I had a discussion with D.O.T and we said we would try to find a way to put a a dedicated bike lane there, but it can't be permanent for probably about two years because I'm going to go back to the other slide here, Generally speaking That measures the flow of the water.
There'll, be a dedicated bike lane, but it's probably going to be movable or mobile at different points as you're working through this process, because I understand your problems with staging and what you're doing And the time frame for this part of the project is more or less.
Lane, it's a safer situation for me also because if someone gets hurt going through there, you know it ends up falling on us, and We're gonna, turn it over to ann and then after then, we'll ask the question from the public.
If you want to go back to that slide of third avenue, I'm, assuming that when you actually get to be working, there, you're gonna have to shut that down It's the between 33rd and 34th, not like just north of the steamwork, where the spot, where the bus stop used to be and kind of, is again, there's actually also a restaurant in the street.
If they were to follow the email that you presented previously, they could get updates every week and definitely please phone the number to find out why people are starting early or on a weekend, because this is concerned about the question Is: How can they be more involved and they want more transparency on the work If you have a complaint about somebody starting too early or something of that nature, the best thing to do for the residents is call 311 and get it logged.
We're going to upload this to our project website tomorrow, And, it's available for anybody via email and websites, and people can hopefully read through it on at their own leisure Our agenda, highlights one of the biggest updates that we have and we haven't been to cb6 in quite some time since we finalized our design earlier this week earlier.
There are a lot of questions surrounding the project, area, 2, phasing and timeline, obviously, and when the contractor was going to start what kind of activities they were going to start with, and how will they be accountable in terms of their deliverables and meeting the project milestones and project schedule?
And they issue the final plans to us that we can provide publicly for everybody to have, and that's all coming soon as of today, Some that dates sometime within the next week or two we'll be able to give the contractor for this specific area.
One further south, and this slide is what's coming next once we issue that, in order to proceed in the next week or two, the next step after that is for the contractor to sort of dive into this slide, and But, then they will go into this piece which includes construction fence and bringing up their machinery, and everything like that.
We've had some pre-construction discussions with the contractor already and they've come up with some plans to maintain access, while they do their work and go next.
We know what they're talking about, but if you're referencing kind of changes to bike paths and traffic, our ccls typically do work with apple maps and google maps and uber and lyft to make sure that they have the most up-to-date construction information.
You know, the pedestrian and the vehicular traffic impact right on 20th and the service road and that whole area and avenue C north of 20th We were actually out there with our with our pa2 contractor last week, just find out where they plan to set up, and you know what their time frame is, and we would have to coordinate that with pc with the pc package, which is putting in those big interceptor dates and and work out the schedule and then potentially having lay down areas that are away from residents.
How I know you had mentioned in terms of the staging that they were going to provide access the to the ferry throughout the construction of reach.
So you know, I, think it's really important to us to make sure that we work closely with them.
We are working with them to design and construct, as folks mentioned a new facility, and that project previously had a funding gap which the which the city was able to fill through.
You know the escr plans have always included the sort of space where the new solar one building would go.
Parks is fairly understaffed, right now, but we're going to work really hard to get this for you by end of summer.
This was a project that I was really excited about You kind of asked, like my first question, which was there was.
We would really have to dig up on the pier and we're not able to do a capital project, but we are going to bring in synthetic turf, so that'll kind of give a little bit of respite and places for area places for people to relax.
