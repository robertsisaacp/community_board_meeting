Okay, welcome to the November 9 2020 meeting of the budget and governmental Affairs Committee of Community Board six.
One of one of the things that we've observed is that we put a lot of effort into getting these just the district needs statement together the priorities each all the committees talk about these things.
That should be considered as a priority has been recorded, documented and somehow communicated so that we can start getting it into the report earlier, rather than waiting to the very end and three just generally keeping help keeping the committee on track.
So I want to talk to kyle and get his permission, but first I wanted to lay this out to you and find out if everybody is willing to take on that responsibility of being kind of the liaison between the Budget Committee and the commit another committee that they sit on and do I have any discussion on that.
So I think it's a very good idea, since you are commenting even the as a public member.
We could have you work with the just kind of be an eyes and ears of things that you see going on that you could then report in the community that you could then report to the district office and the district office could send it to the committee.
No I, think each of the committees should have its priorities on the needs.
I think that's really the job of the committee chairs, because they were instrumental in getting it.
So I almost think it's part of the agenda for committees.
We used to have each committee like reapprove, all of their requests, every single year, and so for one thing that was like a little bit: bureaucratic.
Somebody wanted to take something off of a district needs thing.
It does not seem like it hurts CB6 to continue asking for something in that way, and we did the committee.
We need to get after committee chairs and get them to talk to us, but with the changes that we have in place.
I. Do think it's the primary responsibility of the chair of the committee, but in some way we could periodically inform the chair or ask the chair if their priorities, their major priorities that are stated in the needs.
Just does the best service for the board and the other committees and, like I, think that the historical precedent of us trying to police the the incoming requests and try to like see how fit they are and whether we agree with whether they should continue going I.
Period, is checking in with the committee and saying how are things going on these priorities, because otherwise.
It starts with land use and waterfront, which you see right here, and it has all the capital, expense and continued support, requests that fall under this committee.
Good thing that has happened with the budget requests over the last few years is that you all have really pared them.
And I, think the committees and Brian in his previous incarnation is ad hoc budget Chair and Rick, and molly.
We can just talk to the committee chairs and confirm that who wants this as their primary responsibility.
You know in a couple of days when the blurbs are all updated, but you can all look through some of these and ask sort of critical questions with like.
If you have any comments to make on the documents, if you think we need to schedule a meeting, we can do that, but I do not have any particular agenda items for us for December.
I do not particularly like having a committee meeting the same week as the full board.
If anybody on the committee or any of the members of the public who are listening tonight want to attend that meeting watch our events page in the coming days, we're going to put that information.
