And if I may, I'd like to introduce my colleagues, Brian Parrott, Caitlyn, toner and Janae Malloy are on from Dot's bike share program as well as Kimberly Rancourt and Colleen Chattergoon from the Manhattan borough commissioner's office, who many of you already have the pleasure of working with Nag Laku, Eileen, Body and Sean Macias.
We believe that bike share will play a critical role in getting people around the city and back to work.
In addition to expanding into these new neighborhoods cot is also adding new stations and more dock capacity into the existing service area, including here in CB6, to help support the demands of a larger system, we'll be presenting our infill plans, tonight, and so with.
I wanted to thank the board again for giving us the opportunity to present, and at this point, I'd like to hand it off to Janae from the bikeshare team to walk us through tonight's slides all right.
What 3D bridging is it's a tool that we will use to add docs to stations at locations where there might be an even surface or a lot of obstacles that we need to work around like utilities or tree pits.
The next couple of slides, so at East, 27th Street in Park Ave. This station is proposed for the southern portion of the road bed at 2nd, Avenue and East 29th street.
Janae, yes, hello, I, would like to first address attention to the southernmost bicycle share station at East, 14th, Street and Avenue B.
So I think it would be really helpful if you could make those criteria pretty widely available, for you know both to the board and to the general public.
You know, DOT was not planning to move any transportation infrastructure which included bus, stops and CitiBike stations at that time.
A permanent, open restaurant program will look like and how to kind of deal with all of these kind of conflicts, and you know, need for curbside space over the next few months in terms of these new stations that Janae ran through in CB6, None of them conflict with existing open restaurant setup.
To answer your question about existing CitiBike stations in front of restaurants, no, You know we will not be moving or adjusting a bike share station in order for a restaurant to set up outdoor dining.
The second thing is, with the some of the pictures that you showed for expanding the bike docks a lot of them seem to appear to impede on pedestrian space.
If people are logging on to our feedback portal and commenting that they feel like additional bikes or capacity is warranted an area we'll take a look at that and weigh that.
It's about a pedestrian space, so some of the expansions that I've personally experienced and then just even in the picture that was included in this presentation, showed it you know, impeding onto the sidewalk itself, rather than you know, being elongated on the street itself or expanded.
A big issue that we face in our district is, You know a lot of things impeding on pedestrian space.
Sure I mean we're balancing, as many as there are multiple needs for some streets and sidewalks in New York we're trying to balance those as best we can.
We definitely do want feedback to hear if folks would rather see things in the road bed, but obviously we try to play stations on sidewalks where we feel like they can be placed, and you know not impede pedestrian flow.
The compliment specifically relates to the infill station at First, Avenue and 54th street, which serves a transit desert in the Sutton area community and with the new bridge going up and the Outboard Roadway Greenway extension being built at the end of the bike path.
The inquiry relates to the area at 14th, street and Second, Avenue and 23rd street and third Avenue, which I also think are kind of like deserts at 14th and second there's a CitiBike station that ought to be there that serves the SBS station.
I know there is Helene Weiner Grad, I, apologize, If I'm, not pronouncing that correctly saying, Can you provide regular bike lock-ups near CitiBike spots, but that doesn't seem that sorry.
We chose this route to upgrade, how it will work with the closure of the East River park, some of the design details in terms of connection connecting up to the north, how it looks on the street.
And, As you can see in the other areas on the map, the larger network that can mentioned does continue down to East Houston Street on Avenue C, and also with that project, we're implementing.
If you look on the map, the next closest protected bike lanes that run north south are all the way over on first and second avenue, which is quite a distance from the waterfront they're, Also heavily used at this time.
So Avenue C has the advantage of continuing all the way up to east 20th street, whereas some of the other streets don't make it all the way through skytown or they don't connect up past the waterfront and finally, With the East River park closure coming up, we have heard a number of requests from elected officials and community members during the public engagement process of the East side, coastal resiliency project, really wanting to hear about what options cyclists could use during that closure for a north-south route in 2019, the city released a green wave plan for cycling, which shows, on a conceptual level a citywide protected bike lane network.
Next to look at the East Houston Street crash numbers, because that's connected to this project, This is actually a vision, zero priority corridor, which means that the rate of crashes is even higher and so again.
Over, the years, we've been looking at the data after installing protected bike lanes throughout the city, and what we've noticed is that, across the board, when we consider people driving people, biking and people walking, pedestrians, there's a 15 drop in crashes with injuries.
That's a really significant decrease in crashes with injuries just from these street redesigns, and when we look at the crash numbers for pedestrians, those actually decrease even more so protected bike lanes and street redesigns are a really important opportunity to really make the street safer for everyone, and so the department of design and construction, as you know, is managing the East side.
While the East River park will be closed, it is important to provide a reliable, dedicated space on the street that serves as an alternative, and so again our project meets the need of both building out that citywide protected bike.
We are not proposing any changes to those bus stops, so they will continue to be in operation at their current locations and the bike lane design does accommodate the existing buses, so they'll still be able to pull to the curb.
And I'll share a little bit more detail about that in a few slides, I'm still getting into the existing conditions, and the proposal details currently Avenue C between East 14th street to East 18th street is unique in that it consists of both a service road and a main line.
The bus stop would actually the bike lane design at the bus stops would look quite similar to what it looks like now, where the buses pull to the curb and cyclists.
So at this location, cyclists ride along the greenway off Street and that's going to be closed during the East, River, park, closure and all of the construction work, So we're currently working with DDC on a potential temporary connection that would be protected for that segment during the construction.
That people can use while the East River Park, is closed, and it also helps us meet our goal of building out that city-wide by protected bike.
We did discuss it internally and we are looking at what the potential the best potential design would be, and so we wanted to actually have a follow-up conversation I think with skytown about what makes the most sense for that location.
I, see it on the northern end of this project, but nevertheless it's in order to avoid complications for bikers and pedestrians, and one of the issues raised was the fact that bikers and pedestrians were trying to navigate the detour during the construction are going to be using the Avenue Sea sidewalk very heavily, rather than going to first and second Avenue.
And I, really appreciate, as others have said, the proposal to put the projection of the bike path from 18th to 20th street under the FDR drive, and I've also mentioned previous meetings.
Secondly, going back to the picture of Avenue C between 18th and 14th street and where you have proposed on the West side, creating a parking per no, not a parking protector, but a buffered, bike, Lane I, think that is very wise because it eliminates a problem both for cyclists and for motorists, which is limited visibility around those slip lanes which are very dangerous, and you might want to also consider on the service road, perhaps taking away one parking space at the beginning of the slip lane to further improve the visibility by daylighting.
Typically, What also happens is that as the bus is pulling away from the curb, which is the current case now of what the current conditions are like on Avenue C, you know, they'll, look for cyclists and they'll pull out slowly, and so this is where you know in a location where we already have people riding, because it's an existing facility, they're aware to be looking out for them, as well.
You very much saying hi from the land use millennium side of things very hopeful for your work underneath from 18th to 20th street as gene and everyone else has said, and I'm just going to echo again.
Looking for a north-south alternative to the East side, Greenway, which we all know is going to be closed.
Street be marked for cyclists to cross from Avenue C over to the crosstown bike lane that begins at Avenue.
But what I can say is that we did make some improvements two years ago, when the 20th street project was installed to add the new ramps to come on and off of the greenway.
We want to make sure that we can get that through along FDR finalists, as we went through the final design, knowing exactly how that's going to work out we'll play a part.
But okay, If you have a real quick answer for that, so this section on 13th street between, like the end of the cul-de-sac to Avenue C.
There are a lot of issues in terms of continuity from the East side, Greenway below Montgomery Street, that are that CB3 had serious concerns.
It should not be considered a contiguous pathway until those issues are resolved, including the fact that there are multiple crossings, including Delancey and Houston, which are very dangerous and require people to transverse those streets, then East or West to make connections with these other bike.
And Greenberg has looks like has expressed some concerns about the configuration on 20th street and a rearrangement not executed was worked out with the city.
I've seen that so I understand what you're saying and we will be looking at actually early next year at that presentation for the rearrangement of 20th street.
We're going to try to carve out as much space as we can, There I think the goal is to provide enough space for bikes and joggers, and anyone who wants to you know use the space recreationally during construction, okay and also Sean.
It looks like you wanted to answer: Andrea Peterson's question, but it's about Houston Street, so I'm not sure about CB3, but we have a.
Larry, please, okay, I'm, going to bring back up a long-standing request for improved signage, along Avenue C from 14th street, directing people to the ferry stop which doesn't currently exist and with the construction.
I. Think it's even more important to let cyclists as well as pedestrians know that the ferry is going to still be in operation and D.O.T needs to work with DDC as the access way to the ferry changes during the course of the project to modify the signage and then to bring it back at the end.
I'd like to propose that we do a resolution in support of this particular extension to the CB or to the Avenue C Bike Lane.
Then the Aster Levy, Playground and solar one area where we are starting work, The, Pa2 construction, area, Just, a quick reminder: I, don't know if everyone attends the land use committee presentations, but phase two will be phased in three different phases, so ask for Levy Park had started on November 16th.
Stey, Cove Park will begin fall, 2021 that will be completed in two phases and then the area around Murphy brothers in 2022, so just a reminder that the pa2 is a phase construction and again right now, we're in the mobilization and site preparation, phase of project area, 2, So, pedestrian access right now for ass or levy handball and track access is on East 25th, street.
As we get closer to the Seikov Park phasing again, the contractor just came on board, so their phasing for Psychopark has not been finalized yet, but we will say that the pedestrian access, while we're doing the flood wall work at solar, one, will remain open and again, pedestrian detours will be communicated in advance of closures for bicycle access until the Avenue C Bike Lane comes on board right.
This is the detour for project area two, so it's Houston, Street and then first and second avenue.
The three locations are at the northbound start of the detour at the southbound side of the detour and then signage at the ferry landing areas along 34th street, we'll also add pedestrian scale signage as needed, and we're looking at other areas where signage may be appropriate for this detour.
We are working closely with DOT, as they said to you know to make that happen.
I understand that, but at the same time you know we're talking about shuttling literally thousands of cyclists across this corridor or up Avenue C one way or the other, and this has been coming for a long.
This is kind of a meaningful project, we're talking about by your own numbers, at least a couple of thousand bikers a day who are going to be having to use this car to or else find their own ways, which is something that none of us, particularly wants.
So I think if this is definitely on the top of our list for next year and hopefully in the early spring, we'll be able to give you an update on what our resources look like and how early we'll be able to get it in, but we certainly understand the need for it and the desire to have it as soon as possible.
Sorry like this, Like, I'm referencing, You know like the Midtown tunnel like this work is being done, but like it's not synced up with like bike lanes, and it's just it's bedlam, and this is another example where I get the contractor wants to go to work.
As I'm heading south, You know toward the East, River, Park, sure, Andrew and I.
If there's, If you guys, are going to mitigate that somehow, because, like there's, no way New Yorkers going to follow your rules and b, you know, especially with Covid-19 right.
And I think we have had conversations around Covid-19 as well and kind of taken a look at what other parks and pedestrian areas you know are doing.
The bicyclists are to use the bicycle detour again, like Andrew, said it's, you know.
This is why the pedestrian detour makes more sense than the bike detour, I, think to the entire board of CB6, and so again, I'd like to urge you to reconsider what it is you're doing as quickly as you can, because what is going to happen, as Andrew said, is that people are not going to take the route to first and second avenues.
You're, asking the contractors to actually do sure sandy thanks for the comment, I think around the solar one building there.
Come back with what that area could look like I think that would be really helpful for us to understand what it's going to be.
I, think that would go a long way in terms of ask asking you know: repetitive, questions, And I think it would really broedcast the right information that people are looking for on that site and so with all with the monologue being over.
But you know to ESCR, like you guys need to make that crossover too and sorry just to comment on that.
You know assume that the questions that were raised in the land use committee are going to be this sick kind of at least overlapping, with the concerns in this committee, and so, As you are preparing a presentation for one committee or the other think about the questions that the other committee has asked.
Okay, One of the questions you know, I guess in certain ways might be more relevant to the previous presentation, but Scott Baker was asking was saying: First Avenue is in a distant territory and up Houston at that which has no bike.
Well, That brings up the question: Why don't you detour on 20th and actually Ben Jacobs, who I think you know.
So in terms of the reroute, You know we can look at this again and figure out if 12th and 13th are a better option, but I think the question, maybe that some folks are trying to get at is, Will there be access north of 23rd.
Is that the question like will the greenway and the pedestrian area be contiguous from 23rd south.
If you have a preferred route as opposed to East Houston Street, you know the greenway will be open and we can update this.
I think we can we're going to be dealing with the 145 East 15th street issue later under old business.
I, don't know what the service road FDR drive means in this particular area, because there's Avenue, C, there's the FDR drive.
That is if DOT maintains the lighting and what next steps will be in terms of paving the area that I'm also looking at, but even if we are able to pave and if that's under our jurisdiction, that's not going to be done this year, because our paving season has completed just so, You know, but I will confirm.
There are people, I know have come to this meeting at least three of them, who want to speak to that particular issue.
Not working and Brennan has asked me for 311 reports and the like, but Colleen do you know anything about this Brendan.
She, said, CitiBike, installed, 81, bikes in front of 145 East 15th, street.
