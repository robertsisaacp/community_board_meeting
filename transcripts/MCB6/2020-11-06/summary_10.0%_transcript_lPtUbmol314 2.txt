Definitely a few more tweaks we'd like to make to the design, and maybe a couple of links and things that we want to make active.
The links are actually you know the stuff on top who we are what's up, why we care get involved, are all active and CB6 just takes you back to the CB6 main website.
You know blah, yes, because I do not think anybody wants to read through all the minutes and they do not necessarily make sense for everyone.
It's, a design thing, so I think unless you start, I mean from my the little bits.
You know the long way that way, you would have the room on the page so that, because when we had, I think when we designed it, we kind of.
I do not know yet so that may be the only thing I was going to put an update.
We talked about the one we want to do right, away, which is probably the latest news we've heard from the task force meeting, but are we updating it monthly or are we updating, it.
I know we'll try to see if we can squish it to see a little more of the site, but because it looks lovely.
Let's move on to the second agenda item, which is the updates from the Msbi Task Force meeting.
Basically, they said that everything was again with Covid-19 and the issues and the you know, concerns about a second wave and all these other things everything had been put on hold, but they have been meeting.
You know their real estate division has been meeting on all these things and everything's back on the table.
You know, with Covid-19 they've, been rethinking how they do things so they're redesigning kind of the capacity of what they actually need, which is why they've gone back to the drawing board.
We should, you know, ask or like I already shared this with health and education.
I think before our next meeting, just at least the initial outreach, especially if we're reaching out to people that were asking for some input on the site on information, anything else, they think we should have on there right all good.
If you want to be slightly aggressive by maybe the 15th of December, you can send some kind of a follow- up if you wish or just plan what the next thing is, that's going to go.
Anybody want to work on that, like just a note for the email that the link no corrine, says.
I, know the next agenda item that I had, which I was almost going to take off of here.
When we put together our reasoning for why we need to look at you, know, adding affordable housing or other types of things to any opportunities.
I just wanted to talk about those kinds of opportunities and trying to push more of those forward and getting the right people on this particular working group so that we had a representative from each of the committees.
No, you know, then it's just kind of more work for you.
