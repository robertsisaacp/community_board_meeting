I won't talk about too much, but I just want to continue to focus on the things we've been focusing on open space and making sure our waterfront is safe and accessible, and all the things that transportation issues are really important to me.
There are all sorts of safety issues around there, just with all the different conditions with the traffic and foot traffic, You, know, bikes and so on so again for transportation, land use a lot of different committees.
I just want to mention that we have been seeing increased participation and attendance virtual attendance in our meetings and because the office has been trying to do it and increase its efforts to let the community know about what meetings are coming up and what's on the agenda, and you guys have been doing a great job at having very interesting things on your agendas and when people sign up, we give them the option of signing up for our newsletter there And we're trying to really get more notice paid to the work that CB6 is doing as a quick minutes update for Basa.
This came up because something a presentation about CitiBike kind of overlaps with my work, so I think that we might be able to push this to December the CitiBike presentation and just cancel the meeting for this month.
And then there'll be a chairs report and old and new business, and That's it folks and pam for your third agenda item the street open street application.
You'd like us to invite perhaps sandy from the transportation We, do really want to get this going quickly, because it's our method for outreach and also just for updated status, speaking of which our next agenda item is going to be my giving some updates from the Msbi Task Force meeting last week, which I attended and was pretty vocal.
Too, like the opioid clinic on around the corner from me on 25th and second, is going to be shutting down and they gave some more explanation around that, but In terms of the msbi larger parcels and the sale, you know everything's still on the table, they're, looking at all sorts of options in terms of, it's going to be months, but I want to kind of get ahead of that and get a lot of community outreach going before That be able to update anything that they have onto our website and just keep the neighborhood and the community aware of.
It's, not a huge overhaul, but they're saying that this audit process, you know, in their view, is really flawed and the same thing's probably going to happen to other providers that they were kind of picked on first.
Maybe you know, I, think those things will kind of weigh upon each other in terms of how much space what they need to allocate.
That piece is all coming together, but I will have a much more in- depth report at the 197a meeting and one other thing they mentioned They do a health kind of like status, survey.
Knowing the timing and we have a lot of people a lot of hands kind of working on it, so that should get moving Then we are going to touch again on the outreach plans and the community plan.
Letty's done a good amount of work on kind of framing some things out, so we'll put that, together with a timeline as well a proposed timeline for what we'd like to do, who we'd like to reach out to and when And then we last committee meeting we talked about remapping of the three streets.
So we'd, like to kind of investigate those further and then the next agenda piece is really discussion of Cross Committee opportunities and hey Adam.
197A touches upon so many other groups, including land, use, obviously health, including health and education pieces and including housing And, I'd like to make sure we have a representative from each of those committees on our working group moving forward and that we have a kind of constant communication and flow going.
In, keeping with the Cross Committee opportunities, I'd like to suggest that maybe the new members be appointed to those community boards that are contiguous to ours and they go to some of those meetings, because I think there's a lot of stuff that happens.
A lot and keeping you know are on the issues, but also Jesus, and the office staff work with their staff.
As far as keeping the budget committee up to date, seeing what progress is being made on achieving the priorities, seeing what new things have come up during the year so that we do not get that push at one time and that somebody can just pick it up at the end of the time frame and know what needs to go into.
So we're going to talk about how the members of the committee see that happening or not, and then maybe we have some other things that people are not as much aware of about where they get information and that kind of thing I would not.
, I, think I know people still wanted to be heard , I mean somebody had said it was going to be on our agenda.
Okay, thank you, land, use, Adam, Oh Rick, can I just this sex workers resolution has been bothering me because it's been you've been talking about it for a long, time, and What was lacking in the resolution was how it impacts theaters in our district and this, and I think that in something like sex, workers, I'm a little concerned that it makes it makes it look like we're going after the wrong topics for public consumption, whether it's a valid point or not.
It is a taboo subject, so people might not be willing to talk about it, but it does affect particularly people of color, and we just want to make sure that we're staying on top of issues that could be of you know of importance to our district All. Every committee should keep that in mind: And I'm, not saying that there is not sex work going on in this in our district.
So since this committee meeting is actually going to be pretty light, Sandy er excuse me not sandy molly Maybe issue, sort of a reza or kind of work to some a reso, a larger reza that potentially could be passed in November, great The, Ddc, mfm construction, project, the water main project You know they're taking up a lot of the street and even like a big chunk of the service, road.
We were we're going to have a hopefully a very substantive discussion on school reopening at our November meeting and the reason we pushed it.
