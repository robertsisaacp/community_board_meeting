Okay, the live stream has started, so you can start whenever you'd like okay well good evening, everybody just as a reminder. It's October 6th, Tuesday, October 6th. This is the cb6 parks, landmarks and Cultural Affairs Committee and my name is Pam Vassell, I'm chair of this committee and this meeting is being called to order at what time was it 703 704? I do not know you took my my time away, so I ca not say, let's say 704 and we are joined by District manager, Jesus Perez and Community Associate, Brendan, Birth and Kevin O'keefe, who is the vice chair and Mark Thompson? Who is the former chair of this committee and who is joining us because he has historical information and things that he certainly can jump in and add. So I welcome everybody I'd like to say that members of the public, if you're there, you can raise any questions or comments through the Q&A feature of zoom. If there's time following the committee's discussion will field the questions from the public, so I'm happy to tell you that Jeannie Dinofrio has stepped stepped up to take minutes. So a big kudos to her and now we're going to take attendance and Jesus will conduct the roll call so Jesus, it's all yours. Thank you, pam, hello, everyone! I will take attendance, you may when I call your name, please unmute yourselves and when your name is called please say present and I will make the formal announcement of Quorum after the attendance pam Vassell Present. Thank you, Kevin o'keefe present. Thank you, marty, Barrett here. Thank you. Matt Bondi, Matt Bondi. Keep in mind that I ca not see you. My screen is the attendance sheet. So if you're here please speak up Jeannie Dinofrio here. Thank you, Anton Mallner President! Thank you, Raj Nyer here. Thank you. Reshma Patel. She ca not make it okay, Sean Sherman here. Thank you. Mark Thompson here. Thank you, ronnie White yeah. Thank you. Gary Pappash, Gary, Pappush, Dean, stephanies, being Stephanie's all right with nine members present. We do have Quorum okay. So there is the agenda on the screen. So the agenda for tonight's meeting was distributed ahead of time by the board office and it appears on the screen before you. If there's no objection we'll adopt the agenda, as stated or as seen, members of the committee, if you object to adopting the agenda, you may raise your hand through zoom. Seeing no objections. The agenda for tonight's meeting is adopted. The minutes from the September 1st meeting were distributed ahead of time through the board office and, if there's no objection, we will adopt these minutes committee members. If you object to adopting these minutes, you may raise your hand through zoom, okay, seeing no objections. The minutes from the September 1st meeting are adopted and they will soon be available on the cb6 website. So now we need to set some ground rules in order to conduct a very efficient meeting. Let's observe a few very basic ground rules. No one may speak unless granted by the floor. I guess I would be the floor or Kevin Committee members, if you have a question about committee business and wish to make a motion, raise your hand through zoom. If you click the participants icon, the participants panel should appear and you can find the raised hand function there. If you still have technical difficulty, you may click the chat, icon and relay your difficulty, non- committee members who have been invited as panelists to tonight's meeting. You will have a question and if you have a question about committee, business raise your hand resume. The chat function should not be used for committee business or questions about agenda topics. All such remarks should be made on their re on the sorry on the record. By raising your hand, through zoom chat should only be used to alert us of any technical difficulties you're having or to state in writing information that came up like a website or a phone number or something that came up during the meeting. When a committee member is given the floor to speak, I will identify you and you can unmute yourself so that you can speak and we are required by executive order to create a verbatim transcript of the meeting. So please keep your questions and comments, succinct and germane to the discussion. Now I've added some other ground rules that really pertain to this particular meeting. To begin with, Erica Rand Silverman will read the responses from her committee and I'll read those names in a minute which I asked her to assemble to address the issues that have been discussed. So let me read the members of that committee so that you'll know if I massacre your name. I apologize ahead of time, so we have Erica Rand Silverman Andrea, O, Levitt, Erica, wolff David, Saul, Emily, Breitbart, Lane, Kukar, Courtney, Nathanson, Kyoto, Zuri, Brad Louise was bicky and okay. Next Steve Simon will respond to the issues that were raised by this committee, and let me tell you who Steve will be here with First. Steve is Steve Simon he's the chief of staff to Manhattan borough, commissioner of Parks, Leslie Peoples, Benjamin, Nicolosi and John Earnsberger are part of the design team from the Parks Department. Okay, so Steve will respond with his team. The aim of this meeting is to resolve all the issues that have come up so that Steve can return in November with a completed design. Sketch that's going to be the November 4th meeting. Remember the following things: as in anything in life, compromise is the ticket. If you want this, you got to give up that. If you want that, you got to give up this, so it's all a give and take. But what we want is for the community to love their playground so that your input will ensure that this happens and we feel it's really crucial, certainly from the Community board standpoint, what our members have to say and how they feel about what we're doing is very important. Kevin and Brendan will field questions and will read those with the questioner's name. If they are germane to the topic, some questions will be answered in the Q&A section, in other words typed in response. If you have other questions, you may send them to info Cb 6 spelled out six DOT org and they will be answered, that's info at cbsix.org, and they will be answered now. I want to be clear about this. Normally we so welcome members of the public to speak and have a huge input in what we're doing. But given that this is the third meeting on this topic and given that Erica assembled this committee of parents from the from the two schools in question, Ps, 116 and Ps 281, they will do the speaking for the larger group since they had meetings and they called all the input. Let me just make sure I have not left. I think that's it, but I want to be clear that at the end of this meeting the goal- and the aim is to make sure that the parks Department and that we know what it is, that we're going for and what it is that we hope to achieve by this meeting. And it would be great if we have consensus so that by the next meeting, Steve comes with his department and they draw plans and they show us the beautiful work that they've done on the playground and then we can approve it. So, having said all of that, I'm going to turn this over to Erica, Rand, Silverman and Erica is going to read aloud the comments that have come in, but in addition it will be posted on the screen since it was sent out, but I'm not sure that everyone had a chance to read it. So Erica go for it in your best, theatrical voice, everybody get cozy, okay. So what just to let people know what's not here on the screen is that we did have a meeting about a week and a half ago where over 40 neighbors shame. They were predominantly parents and families and guardians from Ps116 and Pas 281, as well as some other community members who were not identified as parents, mostly people in the community who play with the pickleball association, and there was a lot of consensus in terms of the playground itself. They it felt really great to be able to come to you all today to report back what everybody said, because everybody was in agreement and I tried to record it, but I messed it up. I wish you could see all the kids who so bravely came to that meeting and spoke. They were. They were amazing. What they're you know. What we also talked about in addition to the playground is the blacktop, because the designers from the Parks Department are making their design in direct correlation to what's happening with the blacktop and also discussed was the garden property in front of the comfort station. That's been privatized to the preschool there, okay, so over overall playground, redesign response. The community is very excited and grateful for the allocation of funds for our neighborhood playgrounds and agree that our improvements to the playground are essential Steve. Could you reconfirm when construction would begin on the playground? There is concern that it will interfere with use of the park during the pandemic when outdoor open space is vital. Could you also confirm the dates for the turf and how long that will take so this? For many of us, this is like the only open space in walking distance and through November, we're still hoping to be, and maybe even into December we're hoping to be able to bring our kids outside Pam. Would you want me to respond at this point? Well, I do not know how you want to do this. Do you want to respond individual with to individual issues, or do you want to wait until it's finished? Well? Many of these issues, I believe, are incorporated into our presentation so, but with this particular point I can address now: okay go for it! Okay, so are you hearing an echo? No well, not much okay! I have two things going here and I'm not sure whether or not one is picking up on the audio, but in terms of the playground project itself. It's it's very hard to predict right now when construction will begin, because all of our projects are basically on hold unless the contact awards have already taken place prior to the pandemic, so every all of our projects were allowed to proceed through the design phase, but once they reached the point where they would normally go out, everything is going to pause Steve. I need to interrupt you there's a big echo. Now we're hearing it and it's pretty intense, so should we should we? Let should we let Erica continue? How about now? Oh, that's, wonderful! Okay, do not go overboard. So the to repeat me if you did not pick up on what I was saying earlier, the pandemic is has affected all of our our usual timelines for capital projects. So it's hard to predict right now. If, if we're still affected by the pandemic, you know was six to nine months from now when we would normally go into our procurement phase. You know I you know then, and you know I could in a normal situation, I would tell you: construction is going to be at least maybe six. You know a year and a half away, but but as I was trying to say earlier, if right now we're allowed to proceed through our design phase, but all of our projects are being halted before they can go out for bid. If that's still the case, when we're ready to put this project out for bid in the next six months or so, then you know, then it's impossible to predict. So the construction at a minimum is, let's say at least a year or a year and a half away in terms of the synthetic turf field, installation we're currently projecting that to take place during the spring, and we do not think that's going to take more than a month to to complete. Oh, so I want to make sure I heard you correctly, so the turf will happen in the spring. Yes, okay, we may have previously said that it would take place in the fall, but that schedule has now been adjusted to the spring. Okay, and I call everyone's attention to Kevin O'keefe's little picture if you're, if you've got it up on your screen, because what is behind him is Kevin, you want to say this is a shot of Saint Gabriel's park in about 1923.. It is better known these days as saint fardens, so cool okay Erica go for it now, okay, so this is not. This was not in this letter, but it was in a follow- up conversation and since we're talking about the turf Steve, can you tell us what is the turf mate? What's the material it's made out of you know, I'm not I'm not precisely sure, most turf fields that we install nowadays, I believe, come from a manufacturer. I think called field turf, and I do not remember Leslie. Do you know in this case whether this one is going to have the the rubber pellet infills? With the you know, a rubber covering sand? She might be on mute yeah. We do not use the rubber infill. We may have the sand in fill on this, but I would have to check with the turf team for the for the specifications, so we can get back to you yeah, but if we use the, if we use the infill it's it's, it's virgin rubber that covers sand. It's little pellets of sand covered by the rubber. So it's not that like right, it's not that like green fake grass! Oh no it! Oh that's! On top yeah I mean it's. Basically, it's basically synthetic turf. What you might call fake grass, yes, okay and then the others. What's underneath it that'll be good to know. Thank you. Well, it's in between the little pieces of fake grass. If there is infill in this particular case, I'm not sure whether or not what we're installing in this case is as the infill we'll let you know at the next meeting. That would be great thanks. So much okay, number, three combining scooter bike area with playground area takes away too much usable space for the playground itself, as it is the playground space is full teaming with kids and families and can not be minimized to make room for biking scooting. It also poses a safety hazard for all number. Four plans for the blacktop and plan to the playground are linked. The community is mixed in its feelings regarding the plan to turf the blacktop. Ideally, some of the blacktop would be reserved for scooting biking. Do you guys want to move the screen with me or, if you, if you're hoping that people well we're still? Okay, go ahead? Okay, great a sport plane that requires a bounceable surface. This is the only public open space in our neighborhood, easily accessible for kids and seniors, and we proposed- or I propose, perhaps a compromise to Steve- and this was a personal thing. Not a committee thing that perhaps a portion of it of the blacktop would be left as blacktop, maybe to the west of the entrance, and then everything to the east of the entrance could be the turf and we can pull up a photo of that later if necessary. Oh yeah, Erica. Let me just say at this point that that I was personally on board with that idea. I thought it was a good idea, but the more I looked into it and the more I try. We looked at the possibility of doing that. I was convinced that it's it's not going to suit. It's not going to work for us because we as it turns out, we need the full the full space in order to have a decent size field. You know it's adding that keeping that portion as a as blacktop is going to is going to reduce the size of that field so dramatically that it could only be used by very young kids and it would not suit would not suit our needs and the ability to have you know little leagues, and you know kids like up to the age. Even 12 being able to use a the field, so it's really the bottom line is that it's going to have to be completely turfed okay, but I have something to add, but at the end of your of your reading Erica- and I think it'll be something that will make you guys please but go ahead great yeah and Steve at some point. I hope we can just circle back around once I get through this to. If you know, if the community has sort of no say in our blacktop being used for youth leagues around the city, us being able to ensure that there is space that there is time reserved for the actual community to use it yeah, it is our open space. Yes, we're going to we're going to do that. Well, I heard you were loud and clear: we're going to do that number six! What is the green surface being proposed? Okay, we talked about that. I did put that in there number seven. Oh number, five, the garden area in front of the comfort station is a very sore spot for families in the community. All comments were in support of making that space usable for the community. Okay, we're going to come back to you in November we're studying that issue. We will come back to you in November, with with some comment on what we can possibly do there. Okay, number: seven! Oh number, six! What is? No? I'm sorry number seven! Oh no, that number! Six! I'm sorry! No! That's! Oh! Go ahead! Forgive me number six. What is the green surface being proposed on the ground to the playground around the trees? Is that grass? Is it a green rubber surface? Is it painted black top? What it? What is it Ben or Ben or John Leslie? Can one of you answer this? This is John. I think it's going to be a little easier for us to show you this in the presentation itself directly around the trees would be green space for plants directly around the play equipment would be safety surfacing. Okay, great number, seven, the community. The safety surface is not necessarily green yeah. That's correct, right! Okay! So what we're not putting we're only putting rubber or safety surface under play equipment where it's required? According to safety standards, we're not putting we're not putting rubber around trees, that's correct! So a lot of that surface. I think it sort of appeared to be this sort of like green area. So it was hard for us to tell what time yeah well, we'll show it to you again as we do our presentation. Okay, great! Thank you number. Seven. The community is wondering why the redesign is only focusing on the box area and not incorporating the entire St Barton's playground property. For example. There are ways to enlarge the playground by closing off one first avenue entrance and making that area usable play space or integrate the comfort station garden into usable space for the community playground equipment. The community is not in favor of the direction of the playground, equipment and hopes for more of the following. I wish you could have heard the kids challenging climbing structures. They did not use those words, but in general the community agrees that the pole, like structures and the redesign are not good for our kids. We have engaged with equipment like this in Union square park, and it is the least used aspect of that playground from our observations when we're there with our children, our kids of all ages, love to climb and then hang out at the top, they love the current landing house at the top of the slide that exists now, for example, would this be a good time for me to show examples of the equipment that they know? Why do not you wait till the end, and then we can show okay great number, two monkey bars, these kids are singing for monkey bars and monkey bar ring variations. This is a huge hot spot. We need more of it swings. This is also a hot spot and we need more of it. More single swings for all ages. Our kids than grown- ups also love the tire swings because it is a group activity. We understand, you know the limitations in terms of what that means for size, but hopefully, by the end of this, we'll have more space to work with us anyway, number four houses and see- through tunnels and secret hangout spaces. These are the heart and soul of the playground, the littlest to the biggest kids love them, the kids use them for essential, imagine to play and they grow with them. They also provide shade and cool down spaces. There's not enough of this. In the redesign okay number five equipment with different landing levels: kids love the elevation it encourages climbing and imagine to play. It encourages group play and gathering number another number five, but number six more equipment. Overall, the community is looking for more equipment in the playground, not less to accommodate the amount of kids and families who use it water feature area. The community is very happy to see that there are improved water features and that the safety concerns regarding the concrete steps bowl will be resolved. Thank you. We hope the design can incorporate multi- purpose use of the new water feature, so that area is usable and engaging even when the water features are not in season. That was one asset of the Concrete Bowl water fountain area. That was good. The kids play games in the center of that space and it functions as seating for grown up and kids. Those ledges were used as a track for cars with little kids. It was set up with buckets and acted like a shelf for water balloons. It was a canvas for budding artists, though we know they have to go for safety reasons. We'd love to see further thought be put into this area to hit some of the same successful notes table surface benches. Currently the tables are used by large groups of people. We need tables that enable multiple families and large groups of kids to sit and eat. Together. The community uses the collection of picnic tables for birthday parties and school community get- togethers. Can you confirm that the picnic table tables there now will remain? Well? I think I think we're putting in different ones. We'll see. Excuse me, we've got a presentation about this. You'll see okay, great yeah. This spread out small tables alone wo, not support what the community needs. Also, the metal tables proposed remind us of the ones along the river which get really grimy and gross, and we worry about that. Like amazingly the picnic tables, they never look, gross or grimy. I do not know if it's wood or what, but they stand up so well compared to the metal. Also, it's important to have the benches face toward the playground area and not away from it the gates, fences. Sorry, my notes were out of order. Okay, the eastern perimeter. The community is thrilled to see the gates at the entrances on First Avenue, and then we all met last night to prepare and actually a couple parents were like well do those gates on First Avenue actually closed. So I was like I thought they did, and some people are worried that they do not so some clarification actually on the gates at First Avenue along the street and whether those are opening closing gates, which is what we were sort of hoping for, was what we really need western perimeter along the blacktop, the entrance there behind the baseball diamonds. So it's the South West Corner is usually really helpful for families who are going between the two areas to enter without needing to cross through game play, so the only entrance we noticed is sort of in the middle and unless you're I do not, we do not know unless you're envisioning, some sort of fence or something it seems to us like. We need to keep that one in the corner. Could you look at those entrances through the gate again, a gate that swings open and closed here would be fine inner and outer fences around the playground. So the whole playground has a fence around it and then gardening and then a fence and we're wondering if that inner fence is necessary, we're taking it out- oh great, okay, good, great and the same on the black top. Is it coming out from there too? I do not know we'll have to have to get back here, okay, but most likely. Yes, our goal these days is to eliminate superfluous fencing. What a good goal for 20 20., all right fence, separating playground from the comfort station, so that fence that's being built sort of lies like a border around the playground. It was unclear to us whether that has a swinging gate to open and close, which may or may not be necessary, depending on the gates on First Avenue and just a note to ensure that any fence is low and that visibility from the playground to the comfort station is completely totally clear so that grown- ups can very easily see their kids moving between the playground and the bathrooms, as we can now. One thing that really works in our playground is visibility. Sight lines right now grown ups can easily scan the entire playground, and this is a great aspect of the design that we want to keep. There is concern about this design that the sight lines are not clear enough and that seating is facing away from the play areas. Okay, I just want to say Pam. I just want to say a thank you, because that's not in this part of the letter. It was above it thank you to the parks. Department forever for all the work, that's happened so far and for your willingness to hear from us you know and to and to meet again we're really grateful so Erica, I'm I want to say before I turn this over to Steve and his department that I want to personally. Thank you, and the committee wants to thank you for the input that you've given us. You really have been sensational in getting together with your group and organizing this in a very efficient and wonderful way, so kudos to you and I think, at the end of the day, the park will reflect a lot of the conversations that we're having now so Steve. Why do not you take over and then we'll get back to the discus to something I said we would talk about later on that might please you, but go ahead all right very good. Well, I just want to reiterate your point, and this is a once again with community Board, six, a somewhat unusual experience for us and how we handle our capital project presentations to the boards, and but it's it's good to have the community input. We it's a one of the important bywords of how the Parks Department develops its projects and the more community input the better, and hopefully it will all arrive at a at a consensus and and a playground that the community will appreciate. So I'd like to now turn this, I guess over to Benjamin Nicolosi endo, our architect on this project, and let him do the presentation that we've prepared in response to the community's comments. Steve, I have a few words. First, that's all right! That's John, Ersberger and then I'll turn it over to Ben, okay, very good, yeah and Ben. Where are you able to give Ben the ability to put up a slide at this point? Yes, Ben should have that ability. Okay! Here we go all right all right. So thanks again for having us- and I I wholeheartedly agree with Steve it's- I love community feedback and I love getting into this with you, and I think I speak for us all, so we're here to discuss the I do not want to make it very clear, we're here to discuss the playground portion. That's our job right now is to look at the 4.49 million that we have allocated for the playground portion. So we're really going to be focusing on those comments here, but it's not lost on us that this relates to other aspects of the play area, but we really need your help in deciding how to proceed with the playground tonight. That would really help us to help you so next slide, please, as you may recall, in February of 2020 community members selected the playground area as the top priority at the meeting there and then last month we shared a schematic plan with this committee, which received a vote of approval. However, shortly after that committee members asked that we hold off on our design process and we got to hear that input just now that was taking place at that point. While we waited so that's really great and we received a summary of, we received all those comments and the photos- and we have these in this presentation. So do not worry. We've got your photos and we have put together tonight a not a finished schematic for your approval, as we might normally do, but instead we have a number of options for ways to proceed. So we're really looking for your input on four major areas of decision tonight and that's what we really need for you from you, so that we can come back next month with a new schematic which we hope you'll really like. So with that now I'd like to turn it over to Ben our talented landscape architect to go from here. Thank you, John. Thank you all good evening, as John mentioned, my name is Benjamin Nicolosiendo, I'm a landscape architect and I presented to you last month and I'm looking forward to getting your feedback, so we can move forward. So this slide shows the comments we received at our community input meeting back in February, and these are the comments that helped us develop a design for the playground after the presentation of design. Last month, as you heard from Erica, we received additional comments from the community and some are similar. Some are new, for instance, a request for deck structures and no bike scooter track in the playground versus at the input meeting. We had a lot of desire for a piping scooter track. Climbing structures, of course, still remains a big desire. The slide is just an image from that presentation that we had, and this shows the area chosen by the community. At the end of the meeting. As John said, we have a limited budget and can not address all areas of St Martin, so the playground was the most chosen area for reconstruction and, as stated previously, we informed the community that the multi- purpose area already has plans for the installation of synthetic turf, which Steve also just went into a little bit more detail just before this, just to note that it would most likely be installed in the spring of next year. As many of you know, the park is located at First, Avenue and East 35Th Street, the East River, is a block away, and the entrance to the Midtown tunnel is just to the north, and this is the existing layout of St Varney Park. So we have handball and basketball to the west. We have the multi- purpose area slated for turf the playground towards the east, a comfort station and preschool, and to the east of that is the garden and two main entrances from first Avenue ramp up into the playground, and the existing playground has swings to the north and South I'll. Show you some images of this shortly. A large play equipment is in the center of the space and divides it. Adjacent to that is a sunken spray shower right across from the comfort station and preschool and along the north and south edge is a four foot, steel fence and beyond that, a six foot steel fence separating the park from the sidewalk. I believe this is the area that erika mentioned earlier, and the last minor reconstruction of the playground was in 2002.. There are many trees on site. There's approximately 40 seen here around the playground most are in healthy condition, and the root zones have to be protected. So this poses a significant constraint on where certain play features can be placed. These are images of the existing play unit in the center of the playground. There are two sets of swings, some of which do not meet our current safety regulations, so we had to sort of think about that in going forward in the design after our community input meeting and where exactly they could be placed. There is a spray shower that is recessed and not accessible, and this is the bird's eye view of the schematic design. We present it to you on September, 1st, it's based on the community input and our analysis and just a reminder. The design area is a bit less than half an acre. So it's just where that yellow line is around the around the proposed playground, design and that's the area that we're going to be focusing on so a consolidated entrance to the playground it makes for a safer, more defined space. This was the schematic. We also showed you back in September to the west is a wider, more visible and accessible pathway that leads to the multi- purpose area. I know there was some discussion about the other entrances. However, in the community input meeting back in February, we actually heard a lot of comments about how some of those entrances were unsafe, that people congregate there and smoke and actually currently it requires going over some random block and through playground equipment. So it is a little harder to access. But with these new comments we could take a look if, if that's what the community desires and to maybe perhaps placing a entrance there again. So as you walk in through the large welcoming entrance on axis with a comfort station, there's a large spray shower. That is a focal point when you enter it's on gray, for easier access to the south. Is the area for picnicking to the north, a seating area, that's adjacent to the spray shower and above that is a 5 to 12. Play area has a lot of challenging climbing opportunities, as requested by the community. The 2- 5 play area opens up just below and there is a generous bike and scooter area to the West and south and to the south of that there's more seating areas and a cozy seven foot height swing set. This is the view from the proposed entrance when you first enter the playground and, as you can see here, these are plant beds. It's not safety surface around the trees, the picnic area, that's just to the south of the entrance with this ray shower. In the background, a view of the proposed bike and scooter area to the west and again, these are all images we showed you back in September and, as you can see, there's planting or in these plant beds and again not any sort of safety surface and another view that we showed you that's from the south end of the playground. That also shows some more bike and scooter track areas. So the following slides in green, address comments. We received them from the community. We just heard- I guess basically, all of them from Erica, we'll just reiterate what some of those major comments were and we'll follow that with our responses and the slides that follow and getting your feedback on what direction to take will really help us move forward. So regarding the bike and scooter track, the most recent comments we've received is that the blacktop would be reserved for scooting and bike riding. Ideally, Steve addressed that earlier that the multi- purpose laptop area will be turfed over. So the following comment received is combining the scooter and bike area with the playground takes up too much space. So this is the option that we showed you back in September. It's two viking scooter tracks, plus an area for free play. An alternative here called option. Two is a partial track for bikes and scooters. The other half of the track can be used for tire swings, which I believe was another comment. Recent comment that we received about maintaining perhaps some tire swings. If we did, they could be placed in this area. However, because it's because there is limited space partially due to the existing trees, which I showed you in earlier slides, only two swings can fit here for safety reasons: option three would be no track area at all, so possible. Alternative features for this area can still be tire swings, perhaps picnic tables and playhouses for small children, and these are the three options: we'd like you to consider the large track area, partial track and no track next, we'll discuss swings. The main comment we received was basically more overall swings in the playground. This is option one. This is what we presented to you on September 1st, so there's three bays six swings. Total two strap swings three bucket and one ADA option: two expands the swing area so that there's six wings in total. However, because we have a limited amount of space, there is a there will be some impact, so you could get seven swings. However, there will be fewer trees, less plant beds and less of a buffer between what we're calling the bike and scooter track area now option three expands the swing area on both sides, so this allows for nine swings in total and the impact is two fewer trees, fewer benches and no planted buffer between the street entrance and the swings option. Four expands the swing area in a similar manner. It gives eight swings in total, so the main difference here is that, in this configuration, two ADA swings are provided. This configuration also allows for a small planted buffer to the east, which can remain, and there will also be two fewer trees and fewer benches in this scheme, and these are the four options we'd like you to consider I'll put them up again at the end of the presentation. Ben. Can I just clarify one point when you say there would be two fewer trees, we're not taking out any existing trees. Is that correct? That's correct, proposed trees. Those would be new trees. Yes, yep right now, in total, we're proposing about seven extra trees in this space. Would we be able to remove a an existing tree? That's healthy, no, not absolutely not yeah. I do not think anybody would want that, but it sounds like a good option not to have to plant two more but we'll see what everybody else does all right. So these are the four options we would like you to see I'll just go forward to the play equipment, so the play equipment. We received a variety of comments which I worked very easily went over features some of these features that were already included in the design, and that was shown last month. So we'll point those out there was requests for climbing structures, equipment with different landing levels, play houses and see- through tunnels, monkey bars and more equipment. Overall again, just regarding that last comment. We are constrained by the existing line that you saw in the previous images for the playground footprint so and that combined with the amount of trees on site there are, it gives us a lot of sort of constraints about what can be placed where and how much can be placed within the site. This is the play equipment we presented last month. We add an image in the lower right, and that shows what this climbing structure looks like when it is used. So this sort of tunnel net Climber in the center here and here is another example of the tunnel Climber, it's similar to what was shown in the earlier presentation. This is the two to five play equipment we showed last month. It already contains sort of tunnel play feature, as was asked for in the community comments and another view of the 5 to 12 play equipment, and I just like to re- emphasize. We try to keep it very light and colorful and airy in the shady playground, and also this type of equipment allows for clearer sight lines of what you get with sort of a chunkier platform type structure. I believe right now in the middle there's a very large platform structure with roofs, and it is a bit difficult to see from one side to the other with that in the center. However, if that's really desired, that could certainly be incorporated, perhaps in some way, but there will be some trade- offs so and, as you can see in this scheme, there's just plenty of opportunities for climbing and less prescribed play. We're asked to place monkey bars in the design. However, they were already in the design that we presented to you last month. However, we could put more if desires, so I just want to point out that they are here in the 5 to 12 area, and these are the images of the play equipment that the community provided us. So these images reflect the equipment that is desired in the playground image. One two and one two three and four, I would say, are very similar to the type of equipment that we showed you last month, lots of neck climbers, sort of a modern design with plenty of like rope, climbing opportunities as well and image. One was a piece of equipment that we considered several months ago in the design, but it was found to be too large to fit in the space while meeting safety standards. Similarly, image 5 has a footprint that is too large and also reduces the variety of play equipment that can be organized in the space image 6, which shows this wooden play equipment. This is not something that the agency typically considers over concerns about durability and image. 7 is a large, cohesive, deck structure. This type of equipment does not have clear. Slight sight. Lines has a bit of a larger footprint. However, it's something that we can consider and in the following slide. We have some examples of how perhaps it can be a sort of hybrid type of equipment, combination of decking structures and net climbers, and one possible location for this can be from the slide to the Tunnel Net Climber. So we'd, like your input to know if this is something you'd like to see in the play equipment, okay, site furniture, the comments that we had for site furniture, we're having benches facing the playground confirming whether existing picnic tables will remain and that some of the small tables wo not address community needs so I'll address each of these in the following slides. So adding extra benches can be done in the 5 to 12 play area. They could be placed around that play equipment. However, this will mean fewer plant beds as a buffer, so we can fit up to five benches if we get rid of these plant beds, but the benches can not be placed any closer because of safety requirements for providing an open fall zone around the equipment and in the design that we showed you. Last month we proposed keeping two of the four existing picnic tables since they took up space within the area of reconstruction, but we can keep all four tables if we reorient them in the sort of vertical manner that is shown, and there will still be four new ADA picnic tables as previously shown last month. So the existing tables to remain are in the left image. Those are the picking tables that are there now, and the proposed ad tables are to the left, I'm sorry to the right and these tables fit just as many people as the existing tables and actually more so because they're accessible, so a person in a wheelchair can fit at either end. The existing tables do not meet ADA requirements and also the proposed tables are a powder coated steel, they're, easy to clean and have been successful in some of our other parks regarding fences and sight lines, we received several comments, some of which I'll clarify just going back to the diagram that we showed you last month is the inner offense necessary. We want little fences in the playground and want to maintain sight lines. So this is the fencing diagram, as you can see, there's a four foot, four foot height fence that stretches across the entrance to provide one main entry right across from the comfort station. That's that line in orange. All the proposed fences are meant to be low to maintain sight lines. There are not two outer offenses in our proposal, there's just the one: six foot height steel fence, that is along the sidewalk. So if you look at the red line on the top and bottom of this diagram, that shows the fences that will be removed and the gray lines indicate the existing fences to remain comments we received regarding the spray shower include a desire for it to be multi- purpose. We appreciate the comment about us addressing the safety concerns regarding the removal of the concrete steps to make this big shower accessible, but we know that, however, you also kind of like the future of the steps, because they allow children to put their toys and buckets other things on those ledges. So this is a spray shower design. We showed you last month, it's level with the ground, so it makes it accessible. The spray features are also flush, which maintains a kind of open area that could be multi- purpose when the sprays are not in use. The colored concrete surface can be used for chalk, drawing regarding seat walls or ledges around the spray shower. This is not something the agency normally. Does we try to avoid that in the playground, since it tends to encourage skateboarding and can pose some safety hazards? So what we really appreciate is that feedback from the community board about what we discussed, so we could move forward with the design and I'll recap. The three options for the track area is to have two large tracks, a partial track area or no track at all. These are the four options we provided for swings each with their own advantages. So please let us know what you'd like to see and whether or not you'd want to remove plant beds for extra benches and, if you'd, like all the existing picnic tables to remain near the comfort station and finally, whether or not you like to have larger play equipment with decks and platforms that interface with climbing equipment. So can we do this? Oh sorry, I'm sorry, I was going to say just once more I'll, just return you to the schematic plan and we could remain here for other questions and comments. Benjamin. Let me just ask one question: in the last alternative on the play equipment: do we retain the slide? Yes, either option would have still have a slide. Is that correct? That's correct: okay, that's right, and because the area for where the play equipment is now it's a bit narrow. So that's why there's a spiral slide in that area, but it will remain, but it would have to be in the spiral configuration yeah I'd like to add we. We saw that you liked the current configuration where you have a basically a clubhouse before the slide, so that basically, the idea would be to retain that idea in the news. If you want yeah thanks, John, okay, so Erica, someone from your committee has raised his hand David. So just two quick questions. One is the green that you're indicating essentially around the play area. There's currently ivy, that's all around it. That really is a breeding ground for rats, I'm assuming we're going with just grass. Now there. Yes, that's correct! All that will be cleared and we're all cleared and grubbed in the new design and new plants will be placed there places plants that are less sort of invasive. So it would make that area also just a little bit more accessible and not overgrown it'd be kind of a better managed site, and then the second question I had is- and it was something our group discussed. I know that you're looking at just this area, but it and I believe, Erica brought this up in our comments- is if, in fact, we closed one of the entrance ways into the playground itself, meaning there's two major entrance ways that come up in front of the school and then you enter into the playground. If one of them was closed, would that expand our potential use area, meaning maybe tire swings, could go in one of those areas or something like that so as to maximize our overall space, so it so it would. That would require some additional funding and planning. So right now we're only focusing on the area that is in the yellow, dash line. That's what we have a budget for, so those other areas are kind of off the table. For now, in this scheme, I will say going forward if there does happen to be some additional funding. That's provided for those areas that would actually provide a bit of a challenge, because the playground is about four feet above street level, so it ramps up. There, there's also the entrances to the bathrooms at the comfort station at that entrance, but nevertheless that we're only looking at the area within the dashed yellow line Benjamin at our next meeting and Steve. Can you let us know what the cost would be in case. You know just so that we have all the information. Okay, see you want to I'll, have a conversation with Benjamin afterwards. I I'm not sure that area really lends itself and we're talking about a curved path that leads to the gates. I do not know that it lends itself to having any plague equipment, but we'll talk that over and come back to you in November, okay, all right. So how are we moving? You know we ought to look at these areas, one at a time, so that there's some consensus for each of the four areas that you mentioned so Benjamin. Do you want to lead it Steve? Do you want to lead it? You know how I'm not a I'm, not a parks person, so now Benjamin go back to the slide about about the three alternatives: what's the first one, the three alternatives for the for the bike tracking? It's so whether or not there's a bike screwed track wanted in the space, it could be a large as first proposed a large space. The second option is to have no track at all and I'm sorry and playhouses. Another option is to have a partial track for bikes and scooters, and a small area for tire swings- and I just like to preface that with the multi- purpose area at this point is going to be, is going to be it's going to have synthetic turf installed, so there will not be an area for biking and scooting on that in that part of the park. I do not know at this point. I do not maybe molly hollister or maybe pam has something to say, because I understand from a conversation that our long- term planning director had with molly today there may be an alternative possibility for for an area where the kids could be bike and do scootering I'd like to say one thing and then I'll turn it to molly. If she's still on molly are you on, I am I'm double tasking them on another call too. So, okay, so let me just say this one thing really quick and then I'll turn it to you. First, I would encourage everybody to get involved with friends of the park, because in that way going forward you will have a voice more of a voice, but what I think we wanted to discuss was 36th street molly. Do you want to take that discussion about 36Th Street? Yes, we applied, and I think there was a transportation committee meeting at Cb6, Transportation committee meeting last night that discussed this in more detail, but the a neighborhood group applied for an open streets, application which is closing the street and some of them are shared streets. Some of them are fully closed there. It just depends on the street conditions, but we would be we would we recommended, and we asked for closing 36th street from East from the queen's Midtown tunnel entrance to first Avenue. So, as most people know, they're familiar with that area, that's a fresh, direct and Amazon unloading loading zone, and you know we really it's a large street and we would love to see the bikes and the scooters use that space. So we applied- and I think we heard back- that it was declined and DOT was on the call last night and said they are looking into it. Why it was declined- and I had mentioned that we do have now- have a lot of support from the community and from the Ps 116 and 281 schools and the parents and the you know, and the PTA so yeah, so we're pursuing that and again, as of last night D.O.T said they were looking into it. But we should really push hard for that because it makes sense it's an underused street. It makes it just makes sense, so I hope that we can make that. Would petitions help sure it sounded like it sounded to me my like was a colleen. Yes, he seemed optimistic, but maybe I'm being naive. No, I would love yeah. We just have to see and I they have declined some schools requesting open streets. You know, as we moved into the opening the school so we'll just have to find out. I think when we applied it was in, you know, April or may it was early on in the and the pandemic, and there was not. It was the small neighborhood group that applied for it, and you know there's a little bit of labor that goes into it. Initially, their pilot programs are test programs. It needs the community to come out and support it and to volunteer again initially to you know, put barricades up or you know, depending on the parameters, to do a little work. So I think now we have the momentum and we have the willpower to do it and we may have not had that initially, but we have that now. So I think we can. She heard that last night so, and something else to note is that, if the, if the blacktop is not being closed down until the spring, then that's for the for the family community and the pickleball community, they can do it in the street yeah. We should test it right away. We should get that street closed as soon as we can and test it. It's a pilot. If it does not work, it does not work, but I mean, let's show them that it works, and I think yeah I'm excited about that idea. It's an underused street and we do not. You know let those businesses buy their own storefronts in retail. They should not be using our streets for their commerce and no one lives on that block. Is that correct, nope yeah? There is a little hiccup that there's a staging area for the Ddc water main project. So there is, there is this: you know a lane of traffic or whatever that's a staging area, but the street is so wide that it still leaves a lot of room and we can find out when that's when the gear and the equipment is moved from that block, but even if it's there, it still leads lends itself for bikes and scooters for sure and pickleball. So this solves a lot of issues and that's why I'm suggesting that you get busy with petitions because they're very effective, well Pam, let's follow up and we'll I'll have an answer for you from D.O.T, so we'll follow up. That's we're on it! Well Erica you and David Saul, and everyone on this call and all this. You know that the parents and the schools really need to support this, and so, if we need yeah we'll we may come back to you to say hey, you know we need your help, okay, but this would solve a lot of the problems. I'm wondering. Can we clarify like how this so is the expectation that that we're going to look at these options and make decisions on this call? Or yes, please? Okay, yes, if I might reframe back to this a little bit, it sounds like in light of the idea of another possibility, but it's not a sure thing. You might want to consider this. I propose the idea of considering the center option on the screen right now, because it gives you that flexibility it gives. You can rely on this for scootering in case this does not work out for you, but you're. Getting additional tire swings from this other half the area that we're we would no longer be doing scootering so just as maybe consider option two or do other objections as my proposal for how to move forward on this yeah. So I'm thinking that, if we're doing this now, it probably makes sense to you know have have the parents who are in the community members who are on the call raise their hand to share their thoughts about these options, because we have not discussed these options. So now we have to sort of discuss them and we can maybe try to spend a few minutes on each thing and then see if there's a clear consensus or not, which hopefully we'll all be on board with each other. But Pam do you want me to call on the parents or do you want to call me? Well, I think you know it depends on if the I'd, rather you, since you know them, it- makes yeah there's a logic there, but I do not know that everyone has a comment to make they make well. I do not know that and I'm sure that they might not either, but I think there has to be some discussion if there's going to be if there's options right so also just to interject, it looks like Courtney has a hand raised as well so, okay, so let's hi this is courtney. Thank you for the opportunity. I think there's a lot of work that has been gone into this, so we really appreciate it when I'm looking at these three options and given our conversations, we all sort of agreed and correct me from wrong Erica that the scooting space just does not seem safe inside the park and even all the pictures that were shown were little kids, first testing out little scooters, little kids with training wheels and that's just not the kids that are needing to scoot in the park. So you put a you know a five- year- old's kid scooting they're going to be in and out of those lanes, so my personal recommendation would be no scooting or biking within the playground area, and I do not know if anybody wants to either agree or I guess dissent. I see that kind of okay, you know what thumbs up and thumbs down is really helpful. So I see thumbs up from Kayoko. I see thumbs up from Erica Hey gave it a thumbs up from David thumbs up from lane. What do you think Andrea thumbs up, and I think that if I missed anybody, let me know, but it looks. I agree, we're very concerned about there being kids, scooting and biking in there and little you these little kids. They run free. That's what's so great about this space, that's what's so hard in New, York City! You want your kids to be able to run free, and this is the only space they can do it, and so we do not want to have to be holding them back because there's a bike and scooter path in the playground itself. So we would opt for option three, all right, very good, okay, moving along next area, all right, we just found out what's behind door number three: okay! Now we have four doors right and just to emphasize about that, the last decision, so there will be no bike and scooter track area right in either end in recognition. Also that the multi- purpose area adjacent to it is going to be turf, but that that's not an alternative for bike and scootering. I just want to make sure everyone's aware of that yeah. I think it's understood. Okay, let's look at the swings, so we have four options for swings. Some option. One is the original that was proposed in back in September with planted buffers and then there's option, two three and four, which are various ways in which the swings can be expanded. Option four shows the swings with two ADA swings. Two strap swings which for older children and four bucket swings. What do we lose in each one so that we know what we're really you know sort of supporting sure. So I can go back in the presentation to each one of these individually yeah. So we could more clearly see what is offered not just what we lose, but how many additional swings? Do we pick up in each option? Thank you. Steve. The glass is half full go ahead, so this was the option proposed in September, so you have six swings: two strap three bucket and one ADA, so you have planted buffers on each side from the comfort station and first avenue, along with the fence, a planted area that separates the swings from the picnic and seating area. The second option is, seven swings, so it's a little bit more. In total, two strap four buckets swings and one ADA swing. We would lose the opportunity to have a plant bed on the West side. We would have one fewer tree and that's essentially the impact for that scheme. Option three would be to lose plant beds on either side, so there's two fewer trees that will be able to be planted in total fewer benches, no planted buffer between the street entrance and swings and no planted buffer between the swings and the square area. So this would give us give you five bays. So that's two straps six bucket swings for younger children. One ADA seat swing, so nine swings in total. I see that and then the final option is five bays. So there's two strap seat swings. Four bucket seat swings for younger children and two ADA seat swings in this option. So that would be eight swings in total and two fewer trees. There'd be some less benches and a smaller planted buffer between the playground and the comfort station. And then these are the options all together. Can you can you tell me, because I do not know about the community that needs access to the, and I guess that can always change, but have you I mean, I think it's great, to have an ad ADA compatible swing, so some of them have one. Some of them have two, I'm wondering if you, if you as a community board, have received feedback from within the community that we need. More of this, I'm wondering if like one of those swings, could be for the bigger kids. I'm just wondering if you could talk about the community and if you've heard from them in terms of needing more ADA compatible swings. I just do not know. I have not heard that feedback personally. Is there a ratio of when you have nine swings, you have to have x number of ADA swings or how does that work? No, I mean in general we always try to include an accessible swing for you know for children who require it. So that's almost always a part of the proposal. However, in these four schemes there's alternatives, so there should be at least one. There could be two and I'm not sure about your question. Erica I mean Pam. She was asking if there anybody in the community, I guess brought this up at various core meetings about having more accessible play units. That is something we considered overall in the in the playground, design that we showed you previously. We had a lot of ground play elements and equipment that was accessible so that all children can use it. Can I add that actually option four came about at the request of our ADA expert, our internal accessibility expert, who recommended this based on his knowledge of the community, that he thought that there might be a need in the area, but that's and that's why we're, including it that's what I was wondering. Okay. Thank you. That's very that's very helpful. I think emily had her hand up Erica emily. I yeah I typed in my question to the chat it seems like the ratio is like more bucket to regular, strap swings. So there was like one that was four bucket and two strap swings. Is it possible? Is it possible to do equal amount? Let me let me speak to that real quickly, and the swings that you have now I mentioned earlier in the presentation: do not meet safety regulations so, and that applies specifically to ADA swings and Straps swings for older children and because we have so many existing trees on site. You know there's a lot of limitations as to how far we could stretch the swing area and the safety surface. So that being said, as you can see, there's a bunch of trees behind and in front of the swings, so that limits us into in placing say all strap swings for older children within the space. Okay, so the it looks like the Max Strap strings would be two in all the scenarios. Is that right it could? I mean it could possibly be four. It could be four okay, because that was my question. Can we pick one of these, but then vary the kind of swings you have on it? I think, is what we're trying to ask like. If we want, I mean again, it also really depends on where the swings are located. So these are the configurations that we came up with, based on the constraints with the trees that are adjacent to the the swing set. Maybe you could maybe notice, for instance, if you can see my this little cursor here. These strap swings are directly across from this this entrance, because if there's no obstruction here so allow it allow, it meets the safety requirements for a fall zone. The same thing is true: for these, these ADA swings all the way to the right and option four okay, so the clearance basically makes it so that you ca not put wrist straps in some of the places where they're bucket swings. Currently right, okay, exactly okay! John did you want to say something I was going to say. Maybe a way to go forward is for you to pick your most preferred one, and then you could add a caveat. We could look at including more we could try to make it work with more strap swings. If that sounds like you might be a potential request, yeah, we could see if they fit and then we'll show you next month. If they do so, then I'll just ask the parents: do we want to take out trees from the origin, not that exist, the trees that were proposed in order to have the maximum amount of swings? I think that's kind of like the biggest difference right that that's a good thing to figure out. Am I right wait? Can we can we clarify one thing? I'm sorry Benjamin- and this is probably all me where the swings are right now- is that similar to where they sorry, where the swings are and all these options in the park are they similar to where they are now in terms of I'm just thinking of shade now? Is that the same space? That's correct, yeah, so the swings that in this proposal are essentially in the same location where you have strap and bucket swings right now, so it's on the south side of the comfort station, okay, all right all right and so eric and nothing you're asking personal opinions. But in my opinion there is enough shade. You do get sun there once in a while, but I think we could go you know. So I would put my thumb up to what you're about to say. Okay, so are you counting thumbs now? Yes, I'm going to count thumbs that so basically it's we're looking at option three and four verse. One and two do you. So the question is: are you okay, with having more swings, rather than some new trees there and I'll look for your hands, so I see thumbs up thumbs up David thumbs up lean thumbs up Andrea you thinking, yep! Sorry, can you not see me, you know what yeah your thumb's like off to the side of the camera, all right. So, okay, I think we're all thumbs up on the fact that we want more swings rather than new trees in that space, and I think what I'm hearing is that we'd also really like some more older kids swings because, right now we have two and it's it is like. There's like a line around the corner, it's like trying to go to Trader Joe's trying to get on those swings, so it's possible to add in more. I want to respect you know, what's new to fruity for the community, that needs ADA, accessible equipment and so that's a challenging decision, and I guess we would have to rely on John on your conversation with them to really hone in on. If two are necessary there we do not even have one. So I would think one is a great step in the right direction, but we'll leave that to you guys, because that might be the extra opportunity there. Okay, can we move to a next to area number three yeah. I said. Let me just Eric. I do not really want to mention this out loud, but the fact of the matter is that older kids are known to use. The ADA swings when there's no other kid around who might want to avail himself over that swing. That's been known to happen. That's true. I mean I see that David has his hand raised. Do you want to add something David before we move on? No, it's Kyoko. Oh I'm sorry. I saw it at David's hand yeah as you're moving into the neck. So I do not have another comment on this area. Kyoko. If you do, you go right ahead because mine's a separate comment. Okay, I'm sorry! I just Wanna. Also, you know. We all know that smaller children, little ones, tend to come early in the day, while the bigger ones in the school, the bigger ones. We usually take over those little ones anyway, so we definitely need more for the bigger kids, which is there's just is not enough, and I just also I was feeling a little uncomfortable. I do not mean to upset or shake up this whole ongoing conversation now, but I started to feel a little uncomfortable because we're just being asked to tweak like pick option, one two three option, one: two, three four and it's a it's just tweaking the original idea, the design that we really I'm sorry Benjamin, but we really did not like I'm sorry that sounds very harsh, but we went over and over and kids do not like them and we do not like them and most of it and what is it exactly because I thought we went through all the comments right there. Are you talking? Are you talking about the equipment, because I think we're going to get to that? So, let's discuss that, because it's possible that we just might need more discussion there, but let's just take it one section at a time, so the swing section it sounds like we're all in agreement and Benjamin, you have the feedback that you need on the swings. Well, we also talked about possibility of separating little kids swings versus the big kids swings and that could also be together with the tire swings. You know completely separating so just to address that, as we mentioned earlier, there's size constraints and there's a lot of trees on site. So I realize that you want everything you know you possibly want in this one playground, it's half an acre, it's actually less than half an acre, there's only so much that can fit in it. So if you want more swings that can be done. However, if you want swings in one area, another area, another area, keep in mind, you'll lose the spray shower, for instance, if you want, because that's one of the few areas within the playground that does not have a lot of constraints because there's not a lot of trees around it, so you would lose a spray shower, that's on grade or you would lose clay equipment for ages say two to five, because that's the other area. Where swings can go? It's not. You ca, not just fit everything in this one space. That's what I was saying at the beginning. If you want this, you lose that if you want that you lose this, I you know it's a it's a delicate balance and in a not such a huge space, just a quick clarifying question, sorry to Interrupt, but the green. I think you called it. I do not know what you the green protective barrier or something is it bushes? Is it grass that you know it'll be yeah it'll, be low, shrubs and grass okay low? So is it grass that the kids could actually play on or is it low shrubs that the kids would? Oh, it is okay, so all these little areas right, we wanted some of these areas to be open so that you know they could be accessed. Okay thanks and then the city maintains the grass right. We have. We have a maintenance department that would maintain a lot of the plants on site. Okay, clarify we're talking about ornamental grasses, not lawn, not sod, ornamental grasses, that's what we're referring to as grass there right. Okay. So what is ornamental grass? I'm sorry for my ignorance. What's ornamental grass, I do not know what that means it's well, it there's many varieties and they often have they're a lot higher and they perform a little bit more of a structural role in planting plants, often but there's really quite a range, but it's not like a lawn you're meant to sit down and have a picnic on this actually occupies the plant bed and has a presence in a plant bed. Oh, so it's not it's not usable and like in term in terms of the kids sitting in it well for texture and for creative play. There's a lot of there's a lot to be said for allowing children to interact with plant material directly. So in that way, definitely, but it's not like a picnic area that would be pretty unsustainable in these areas. Shady and not very large. I was trying to understand the depth because you've got option three. That has none option. Four, that has looks like about half of the other two options, and is that just decorative? Is it useful? Is it decorative because if it means another swing or another, something else how beneficial is it decorative? That's where I'm kind of not sure about. If we were choosing between the two, I can speak to that. So really, a visual separation between user groups is often beneficial, so you have an adult seating area just outside there, and then you have the swing area. So a lot of times. People prefer having a little bit of planting between the two. It's not required we're getting into pretty details of design that what we do as landscape architects, but we consider all these things so, but we're kind of putting it to you but- and someone had raised the question to me- is that usable green space for the kids to actually play in versus more decorative. That that's why I raised the question yeah. The answer is yes, and no with usable, it's yeah, it's good to know that it could be gardening space. I think that's very appealing to the community, but I do think because the way we exist now is we have a concrete slab with equipment and we've all sort of gotten used to that you know so I think we're not, I think, for us important to have decorative space. For appearances, I mean, I know our community has no green space, but I do not think the playground is necessary that in the community, because we really do not have open space either, and so we want to maximize using the lands for play so having some of the gardening, I think, is very appealing, but if it, if it's a difference between decorative grass and a swing, I think we want the swing okay. Well, I think we got your selection on this one yeah. Thank you. Okay, let's move to the equipment. What what do we need to make a choice about the benches? What did we just skip over? Oh the benches, but someone just mentioned this, the equipment, so we could jump to that. I do not know. Go back to the benches. I'm sorry, I did not mean to well. This seems like a pretty easy one. I think we want the Ben we. What is this? So is the question if we want the, if you want extra benches to replace the plant beds and the existing picnic tables to remain so, you would have two tables sort of stack one right. Next to another right across from the comfort station and just outside of the playground, and is it? Is it not possible to keep the wood to keep wood picnic tables? We would keep the existing wood picnic tables the other as we as we mentioned earlier with the previous equipment. It's those tables are not accessible, so we would have to provide a picnic table that is accessible to all. Okay, can we use the rpl for what are you referring to Steve for the fair than the news for the new benches for the for the new picnic tables? We could look at that if we want to use rpl what is rpl, what is that it? It's called a recycled plastic lumber, it looks just like wood and does it stay so nice and clean yes, cleaner great, so are we in agreement? What's the direction for this benches extra benches and keep the existing tables I'm just scrolling through to make sure I do not see any hands but yeah? I think we definitely. We we've already discussed that we want to keep the picnic tables there, and so yes we'd like to keep the picnic tables in there and I think in terms of them, so the benches. The issue of the benches is just having more benches around play areas, so parents can sit facing the play areas and keep their eyes on the kids rather than having sort of garden space. You know how I do not like the garden spaces. Where tables are they look lovely, but I just think the priority is having seated face and we go to sit and look at the equipment we do so all we want okay, great and then finally, we have the you wait. Did you just want to chime? In? Did you just? I was just going to say that the one thing that we've seen over the years is it's like a nanny battle for benches, so sitting space is really an important thing in this play area. Benjamin. Just because I again do you guys happen to know how many benches are in the image you just set up before versus what we have now and with that said, those crazy steps that have hurt people in the past, but also get used around the water feature. People sit on that now too, so to David's point they're, using every inch that they can to sit. But do you know a comparison of what's there now versus? What's in that image, I do not have precise numbers, but I do remember looking at it several months ago when we were looking at it analyzing the space and we can go in there and it is comparable. I would, I actually do recall it's actually more with the four extra picking tables that are in this design. So there's more seating options. Are the steps covered with any surface so that no one kills themselves tripping on the stairs? There are no more steps: yeah, oh, okay, great, okay, so the play equipment. Is there a desire to have a sort of a hybrid version of the play equipment? So, as you see in this lower left image play equipment that has some decks and platforms combined with climbing equipment for nets and ropes and things of that sort yeah. Can I just make one question: make one comment before we sort of launch into that those polls? You know just the like poll structures we just yeah, I mean we had 40 parents on that on that call that we did a week and a half ago and every single one of them agreed that nobody uses those polls. So that's a that's an easy effect. We can get rid of the polls, okay, so it seems like wasted and then also I know we're going to get to the water. But I do not know that we're going to get to the water feature, because I'm not sure that we had options there to talk about, but those the water features are also poles versus, perhaps like arches or other shapes that can be used, because I think I heard you mention like when they're not being used. You can use those structures but again they're poles. So are there other water features and perhaps we're going to get to the water feature, so I wo not go there, but I did want to make that note in case we do not have a plan to go back to the water field yeah. I know we were not. We did not have an option for water features because we mentioned that is that great and in terms of the space being used, we're talking about it being still being able to be used as a multi- purpose space because a lot of the ground, the spray features, are flush, so it would remain open and regarding those holes, those offer a variety of different spray features for those bigger structures tend to be for older children. So you have misters and you have different types of fountain sprays that go in a myriad of directions getting back to the equipment, Benjamin, there's a terrible noise coming from your voice from your computer. It's just not your voice. It's the computer, that's making a gravelly sound! It's very hard to hear. Let me turn off my video. Perhaps that will help any better. Now, no John, if you hear me, maybe you could yeah. I was about to suggest that maybe I should take it from here and then you can listen and chime in with your gravelly voice, if absolutely necessary. So yes, we so we're in the middle discussing the play equipment we've got one option here is to change a section of this, and I know Ben just mentioned no problem with the polls. We can eliminate those and we will find other things that basically, we've got a pretty good sense of I think of what the community is looking for now we'll replace those. But then the idea we'd really like to get your input with, because it takes time to revise this in time. For the next meeting. There's a little bit turnaround with these manufacturers is. Should we revise basically half of this unit- that's kind of outlined in pink here to more of a deck structure, it could have a roof, it could be more of a club house and would that would that kind of take care? Is that kind of where you want us to go? So I see that courtney's hand is up courtney. Do you want to speak to that sure? I think the overall general answer is yes. We definitely like that. I think a few particulars you know having this arch structure with this yellow ball at the top. I just do not know what that's for. I, it terrifies me to think a kid. Would try climbing up there and then essentially fall down on the slide, so I think yes, some of the structures that you showed there was a slide. You showed that had four different images. I think some of those are more interesting more to the liking. I did have two specific questions as well. That slide is that as high as the slides that are on the structures that are there now, because it almost looks like it's just smaller, like everything shrunk a little bit and then, if this is an eight foot high slide, we can go and make sure for the next presentation that we can be clear on if it's the same height or not, okay. The reason why it's a spiral is because this fits in a tighter area right, so we can give you a more exciting slide in a smaller area if we curl it up yeah, because the kids love the spiral, it just looks smaller to me. There's a couple structures on the right. One looks like a bullseye. It almost looks like two circles, just on a pole sure those are ground. Oh yeah, those are ground play panels. Sometimes you spin them. It creates an optical illusion like a spiral and anyway, in any event, having these two- sided panels where kids can gather is a real feature that is aimed at children with autism and other mobility disabilities. I mean everybody loves them, but it's an idea of getting a lot of interactive things at the ground level. It's a requirement, but we go above and beyond, typically with our playground, designs in New, York, City parks. Thank you for those. Did that help yeah. Thank you. Can I ask we have one less slide, it seems like, or do we have the same amount of slide? Well, there's this slide in the 5 to 12 area and then Ben, if you're still a bit of control and go over to the two to five just so we can see the other slide. No, I'm talking about not that no okay, so in the 5 to 12 area, we have the one spiral slide. Okay, so we currently have two. So let's would be a, I think, an issue for manny. We have one spiral and one straight down on one end. So if you could consider that as well and then yeah I'm trying to see, even so, we sounds like you do on- are getting what the community wants, what the children want. Most importantly, you know children are asking for more challenge, meaning they actually like to. They do like to climb up the poles. They ca not climb up, but there's only way to just come down. So that was an issue with the children they like to go up, have be able to go to another place and come down continuations of that the clubhouse type of theme is great, and I also for the next meeting. It would be great to have, since now we have. We voted on the other option not to have the track space for scooting space that maybe you can have a something prepared for next time for little kids area, like a little house pirate ship that type of thing for the imaginative area. That would so, I think, we're going to get there next Kayoko. That's, I think, that's not we're going to right John. Do we get there? I think we've already kind of voted on there. So we've got more area. That's going transitioning from scooter area to play area. So you're going to see us fill that with things we think you'll like based on all the input that we've gotten from you yeah. I see that Emily's hand is raised and just if you want to speak just raise your hand because people are waiting and that way I know who's waiting ahead of me. So I'm a parent in the community, I'm also a pediatrician here in the community, and I can tell you that, like any pediatric physical therapist in New, York City will tell you that kids that grow up in the city have some delays in terms of their gross motor milestones because they do not climb upstairs in their home and they do not. Do you know climb up hills generally, like things that you know, kids who live in the rural or suburban areas do so I think you know just I like the right now. It's there there's like multiple steps. There's layers going up going down, you're going to different things, not just going sort of up and down from the floor, but there's different levels so that they can step up like stepping stones. So they can learn coordination and balance going from one step to another. Just keeping in mind that you know the for you know both younger and older kids, keeping in mind just gross motor and that you know, I think the multi- layered sort of building up approach that we have now similar to. What we have now seems to be what most kids from crawling to walking. Can you can pretty much use, there's like a larger lifespan of those, I think, of those kind of playgrounds, and if you do not mind if I can interject, this is Asia, I'm the vice chair of Kimmy Board and I'm actually an ot, and I would actually agree with you emily. I'm glad you brought up that point, because some of that different sort of gross motor activities in these things are actually really important for the kids to experience. So I just wanted to agree with that. Okay, can you John? Can you show the like that net equipment in action, because it looks so different in action than it does in this model? Yeah? We agree. We think the photo really tells a better picture of what it's like to play on it. That's cool the panels. I just want to draw some attention. There. I've seen some panels some really interesting panel stuff done like in Madison Square park. They have those chimes they're like inlaid, it's so beautiful. So sometimes you come across panels that they're screened and they break and they break so fast and they're, never using them, and then you have some like those chimes that are just so brilliantly incorporated and they last, and so I just wanted to draw attention to yeah we're working with a really great manufacturer here. I would not be concerned so, and we've got some really exciting musical equipment. I do not even know if Ben has really drawn attention to this over in the area and there we go he's highlighting it there, it's kind of a musical play area, it's an opportunity in this park, because there's not a lot of residential road adjacent to that area, so we've got musical equipment over there, which would be pretty exciting right. I think, if I can just say something really quick, I think one point that we should point out is that everybody at this park loves the park. The way that it is like we have the older kids section. We have the younger kids section and I think what the consensus, at least at the last meetings that we've had last night and the few weeks before, was that we just want to revamp right. We just want to remodel Modernize. We love the way that it is the little kids at like area with the house and then the big kids with the climbing and the up and the down. We just we love the tire swings. We love the swings. I think we just need to modernize what we have, and I think that was a big consensus. You know in all the meetings that we've had with the parents with more netting with more of these climbing exactly so. What do we have to agree on here? John? What? How can we be helpful? Are there options? Do we have an option page at the play equipment option? We were kind of looking for the go ahead to totally change part of the equipment. Obviously we're going to be adding new equipment in another area. That was an option we already talked about so that you're getting more things that we think you're going to. Like in the what was the scooter area in this area that we're showing now we're going to try to make more of that clubhouse atmosphere before the slide that you have now so we're going to try to recapture some of that which you like about your current equipment in this area. So if that seems like we're on the right track, give us a chance to just you know: do it we've heard your feedback and then we'll come back to you in November, it's more like the like. It's more like the tompkins square playground, just as a reference. Perhaps, but yes, I'm just going to look for a thumbs up that you're in agreement. Oh, I have a ques sure Erica that included another slot, because I do agree with Kyoko's point about the two slides and then John. I do not know if you addressed this, but in the little kid area I might need to see the slide again. I do not know the little kid area currently when you just said clubhouse. They kind of have that little situation twice right now in the little kid area, and it also gives shade- and my kids are older now, but I thought that was good to have, and I do not know that you had that in the little kid area other than that Eric I give it up. There is a parent on the call who I saw made a comment in the section that she was actually hoping for more shade in the little kid area. Is that something that's already in the plan John? I do not know we're putting understory trees where we can really, with this much shade, already established we're looking at introducing some understory trees, I believe Ben. Might I wish I had been for that part, because it's a detail that I'm, I believe, that's the kind of direction we're going. Okay, so maybe yeah can you hear yeah? We do plan on planting understory trees, as well as some larger trees, but the space itself already has over four countries. So there are okay, so it sounds like there are a few new shade trees, we're planning as well, but I just meant that I just meant the equipment itself gives shade. Oh yes with roofs, all right, that's what I meant yeah and so we're going to do right now, right. So we're going to look at including some roofing and okay. We could we can do that in the two. What we call a two to five year old area and the five to twelve area Sure John. Is there a double slide that you can use yeah, there's a double slide, because that's another option, I'm just throwing out. Oh in the five to twelve, not for a spiral, though nothing I'm aware of not a spiral, just a straight up slide. That's one way to get more slides, we'll look at all things like that. Okay, so I'm going to just look. I just can I add one thing that would yeah. We definitely talked a lot about the monkey bars being a hot spot, and you know I think my kids at least looked at some of the new plans and liked a lot of what they saw there. But you know they did point out, there's not as much space to sort of hang and sit on top. You know I just wanted to make sure that that's it's definitely something that's included. It's certainly possible to do more monkey bars, but at some point they understand we are going to run we're going to take something away. It sounds like maybe something will trade out those noodles upgrades, maybe we'll try to sneak in some extra monkey bars instead of those upright poles. That would be great. That would be a win- win all right, so I'm going to go down the row so just give me a thumbs up if we're ready to move on from here I see Courtney, I see Anton Emily David Kyoko Lane. Oh, I see that David's hand was raised, so I think we nailed that we're good. So, just moving to one thing: Steve, you had mentioned something earlier and it just kind of struck a chord with me in regard to the turf. I know we're not talking about the turf, but you had said hey like you might get 36th street. You might not get 36th street like you're, giving up the track, but you do not know what's going to happen there, and then you had said early in the very beginning. When we talked about the turf we ca not go turf into blacktop. I do not mean to take everyone backwards, but it can you elaborate on that a little bit because it's depending on what the sports are there, that we anticipate being there it would seem there is enough room for some things and not enough room for others. Or do you want to table that for the next conversation? I do not want to belabor the call. No, I well, I'm not I'm not sure what you're alluding to the the space as we see it is is really just barely enough. Not even it's not even really enough for a for a decent. You know Little League regulation field, but it's enough for us to allow some little league kids to play there and the what we foresee is having a a baseball softball field with a soccer field overlaid, so it could be used for more than one sport, but the turf would basically would be go from one end to the other. It would completely cover the blacktop so to David's point and I'm getting phone calls from people who are on the calling on this calling ca, not speak. They I'm so sorry everybody, but they are concerned that we're giving up the scooting in the playground, which I still stand by the fact that I do not think it's safe. But I and I know we ca, not talk about the turf, but we do not know if 36th street is going to work and one other thing that has not been mentioned. That I just want you to be aware of is the economic impact that turf is now having sorry that asphalt is now having, because the pandemic is huge. There are small businesses in this neighborhood that would not be able to be holding classes. If it were not for that asphalt so and again Steve you mentioned it was going to be pushed to spring. So that's definitely helpful, but I'm you know, I think the pandemic's still going to be happening in the spring. I'm a nice one. I hope not. I know, but I just want you guys to be aware of that. I mean this is not so a we're now we're all saying and I'm glad we were in agreement that the scooting is maybe dangerous and some people actually do not agree with that. They think it would be okay and safe, but I I'm nervous personally, even though I've had a very strong thumbs up there to give that up completely when we really do not know and pam to your point. Definitely petitions definitely going strong for that. 36Th Street and I know we'll talk to you guys again in November, but I just I personally want to make that clear that I'm terrified to give that up, not knowing what the future holds, because I'm personally not even that comfortable on the playground. Right now, with my children and all we do is go to the asphalt so take that for what it's worth everybody, but this is a little bit scary for us as a community. Thank you I you know. I appreciate it and we hear you- and you know this is the thing when you want to open up space in a thing where we do not know. What's going to happen, it really requires that everybody get out there and push and then miracle of all miracles. It happens, but it takes like really diligent and obsessive fortitude to make it happen. But we hear what you're saying it's an issue. I understand yeah, so I ca not promise that this wo not come up again. November 4th, they probably will eric. If I could, this is Kevin anybody who does feel that they're not being heard. We certainly are going to get to the point where we are going to address questions that have already been posed in the Q&And a box. So they continue to do that. We're certainly going to answer everything that is relevant, so we're listening to everything, thanks for mentioning that, okay, so, let's just ask just Steve who handles the permits for the multi- purpose play area, the recreation staff in my office in the in the Manhattan borough office. So it's in your office, yes, and in your experience, have you guys ever taken chunks of the calendar and set them aside as unpermitable, because they're for use for the community? I hesitate to answer because I'm not sure I I would have to get back to you on that point and if we have not done it in the past, I've already spoken to people here about how we need to do it. In this case, that's great, thank you, Steve. Thank you. I'm nervous! No, I'm going to be coming here office. Do you have an extra desk in there, so we set up set up shop. Okay. Can we move ahead to the next issue? I think, is the water. I think we may have everything that we intended to ask you for a vote on now. You were about to say something about water and I'm curious. No was not there another issue here or no. There is just the conversation about the water area, but it sounds like John knows what we're looking for yeah right and making sure erico. Just one thing we said it looks like there is a water fill station or a water fountain that will be in the turf area as well. So I just know that came up in our group conversation. Oh yes, we've got that too and John. Can you clarify? Is there a gate that closes on first avenue at those entrances? I was just looking at it on street view. There appear to be gates to me that can open and close and that's what we're referring to. As the point of access, I mean the point of control for children entering the playground now in terms of whether or not they're being used. Now it's a it's a discussion to have perhaps with Steve no they're. Not so maybe they need to be closed and then one opened whenever when anyone comes in and out in order to regulate the flow of traffic going forward, but it's not something we design differently. These gates are very large, they're, not they're, not gates that you open and close when the kids come in and out with the nannies when the moms come in and out there to close up the park at night and to open up the park in the morning by the Parks Department, so they're not they're, not usable, on a regular basis. Okay, so in that case, perhaps we should look at putting in a gate at the between the comfort station and this spray shower. It sounds like, since this is outside of the area of our project, they can get the gates from First Avenue, but we do have domain over a potential gate between the spray shower and the comfort station yeah John. I think we need to do that. Yes, yeah, and it sounds like this is the right thing to do. Okay, yes, so we'll look at that, then great. Do the parents agree with us? Well, I'm just thinking that gap between the comfort station so right now my kids go. I mean eight nine, seven, six year olds, maybe they're going to the bathrooms by themselves, so they're going to be going in and out of that gate all the time not to mention they like play around there and you have your birthday parties around there, and so I do not know. I feel, like the one of the biggest keyest things that this community has been asking for. As long as I can remember is gates that close on first avenue, because I do not know how we're going to control that gate area between the comfort station. The playground is like realistically going to stay. So it's going to be a it's going to be a four foot high. It's going to be a four foot high fence, which is a lot lighter, so it'll be easier to use. Now I do not know if that completely resolves your question, but there is that aspect where it's going to be lighter than those gates at First. Avenue people tend to use what they can, but if I could jump in I'm so sorry, I did not raise my hand, but the there is a flow on our playground. Currently, that goes all the way to the comfort station and beyond to those picnic tables, Et cetera, where kids are constantly running back and forth and using that whole area. I think if you stop people from doing that, you will even make the playground feel smaller, but I have to say we heard very quite clearly that we wanted that parents wanted a way to regulate and be able to tell who's in the playground who's not in the playground and that's exactly why we established this new border. So it's a little bit in contradiction to the totality, but I and I understand what you're saying, but that's where this is coming from- is that we're trying to establish a little bit more of a check in and out system so that you can know who's in the playground and who's out. I'm just worried because it's because you have to leave it to get to the bathroom and you have children going there on the you're now relying on eight and nine year olds to close that gate, and there could be a little three-, year- old hanging out right there and an eight- year- old's, going to run through to the bathroom her friend's going to follow her friend's going to follow, nobody's going to close the gate and a three- year- old's, going to walk out after them, and now there's this there's this expectation that we have these gates and but in reality, they're going to walk right out the gates on the first half, which was why the hope that those that the first Ab would have closable gates that you can open like when you go into 29th street park. Not that that's a great example, because that gate's such a mess but like you, can open it. You walk in and you close it and there's no like you're, not worrying about a nine-, year- old who's running. You know! Well, it seems like we have now the totality of the input that we need to look at this. So I do not want to. I do not want to say that we're going to be able to do something with those kids, but it is now where our understanding has expanded about what the issue is. So, let's give it a let's. Let us give it a try in November. Okay, all right! Thank you! Okay! So Kevin do you want to pick up on any of the questions that have come in or I'll be happy to, and I think a couple actually looks like four have already been answered, but I will pose one that just came in from Trevor. Johnson are the existing picnic tables separated from the play area by the four foot fencing? Yes, the existing picnic tables that are going to remain we're going to be relocating two of them, maybe Ben, can bring up a more appropriate slide, will be fenced outside of the playground with the comfort station, so it'll be a place where you can watch and see, wait for someone who's coming out of the conversation or you can have a bigger party, but it's meant to be more of an adult area, so this might clarify it. You can see it's not just for adults, so it's for everyone right, multi-, generational area, yes great! Thank you! Steve Kev! Anything else, yes, Courtney hurst, just about four seconds ago came in the other issue is that Parks Department uses the first Avenue side as a driveway, which makes it hard to install a pedestrian gate anywhere. That is a important consideration. They do need at least one where they can bring a vehicle up. Yeah we're so we're aware of that constraint as well. I mean might mean that one side gets a different treatment, the other, but we have to consider it all this yeah. Okay. I just want to also draw attention to the fact that there was a question. There was a comment. I hate to bring it back up, but alpha I see that alfonzo was sort of upset about the scooter space, so I just I just want to give some clarity to so that people know is that when we held the meeting in a week and a half ago, we did ask all parents, you know in attendance. I really asked let everybody know about that meeting and then everybody who came to that meeting. I said, please, you know, make sure to email me if you want to be forward- facing that, we only had the opportunity to have the amount of parents that we have on tonight and we have nine to be forward- facing in today's call and at that meeting with the 40 parents there was no objection at the time to removing the scooter space. So the our vote on the scooter space is not just three people's opinion. That is a reflection of the 40-person meeting that happened a week and a half ago right, and I think I'm sad that you're sad. I just want to I do not you know they try to read between the lines here. I think part of it might be that they did not realize that the potential for bike riding on the larger space would disappear. So that's, you know- and I think I mentioned this in a previous meeting- I've had three kids who all wanted to ride their bike. There I hate to see that go away from a personal standpoint, so maybe there was an understanding that just because it was not in the playground did not mean it was going to be. You know not be someplace else, so I think that's I would say of the constituents that I've heard from on St Martin. The most comments I've heard is about making sure that there's space for riding bikes, so I think it's a valid point that Alfonso makes and I'll move on to the next question. This is one from. Was it answered? No, it has not been one more question: tara, Francis. The weight for swings is more for older kids swings. There are currently only two, and none of the newly presented options adds to that. Okay, so we are, as per the vote, that we took a little bit earlier, we're going to look at an option that was not up on the screen, we're going to try to make it work with even more straps than the options we show on the screen, but we really have to look and see what really fits, especially considering that some of the scooter airing is going away, we're going to look at the new set of opportunities and constraints in totality and see if we can get more straps, so we we've definitely heard this feedback. Does that help yeah yep? If anyone feels that they have not had their answer question answered, please repost, I believe we've hit every one, that's up there. Let me double check. Yes, we have okay. So having said that, I think we may be finished with this portion of the meeting and we would be ready. To conclude, I want to say once again how grateful I am to Steve and to the designers for having been so amenable to work with us and to make this work for a park. That's going to work for the parents and to the parent group. I ca not thank you enough for your participation. It's a lot of time. It's a lot of energy, but at the end of the day the payoff is going to be that you'll have a park that you had a hand in, and so I want to thank you all so much and thank the Parks Department for what you prepared for tonight and think you did like a stupendous job and given the time of it of where we are now and we've been on this meeting since I do not know when it feels like forever. I want to thank everybody and I want to say that that what will happen in November is we'll see, sketches we'll see plans, and then we can vote and have some consensus. You know and move forward so that we can move forward with this park. I do not want us to lose money. I do not want us to lose time and I want us to be able to complete the park so that we can go ahead with bidding and all the other things that have to take place. So what I'd like to do? Does anyone from the committee, the Parks Committee, have a question? No okay. So what I would say is I'm going to waive my report Wes. Do you have something very quickly that you want to report on, or should we wait till next week and let next month and let you do a complete dog and pony show then Wes, oh he's frozen huh in here yeah I do not have a we can. We can do it next month. If you want it's totally you. I know, we've gone, you know pretty late, so I think you know what one of the things you might consider next time is just giving us a little rat update, sorry to be so gross about it, but you know that's the deal. Are you calling my manager a rat? Does any member of the committee have any older new business? Okay, I want to just raise one thing, which is to thank Kevin, because Kevin made it possible through very diligent work, to get the nets on the basketball courts and- and it's just been wonderful- everyone has been very happy as he was putting the nets up. There were people saying Yay, you know we had. We did not have nets before and now we have nets and it's great it was a very concerted effort. So I thank you very much. Thank you shout out to Wes and John and everybody else. I mean if it was not for obviously New York, City parks and actually a partnership for parks. It never would have happened and one last thing: it's a it's a work in progress, Wes and I are still working on our on Peter's field. But thank you that's great, and I want to thank Jeannie because these minutes are, you know, a real picnic, sorry and- and so having said all of this and having heard everything if there are no objections, is there a motion to adjourn the meeting? Could I just confirm that the next meeting is on a is on a Wednesday November, the 4th that is correct it's the day after all, right, I hope we're all in a good mood that day, oh well, we wo not have anything to be in a good or bad mood about yet. Okay, all right! So may I have a motion to adjourn the meeting motion. Adjourn motion. Okay, all in favor hi. Oh, it does not require a second look at that. Oh, so no objections, adios everybody! Thank you see you in November.
