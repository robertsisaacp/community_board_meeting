This is like the only open space in walking distance and through November, we're still hoping to be, and maybe even into December, we're hoping to be able to bring our kids outside Pam. And I'm, not sure whether or not one is picking up on the audio, but in terms of the playground project.
So much okay, number, three combining scooter bike area with playground area takes away too much usable space for the playground.
I. Think it's going to be a little easier for us to show you this in the presentation itself directly around the trees would be green space for plants directly around the play equipment would be safety, surfacing.
There are ways to enlarge the playground by closing off one first avenue entrance and making that area usable play space or integrate the comfort station garden into usable space for the community playground.
It's important to have the benches face toward the playground area and The community is thrilled to see the gates at the entrances on First Avenue, and then we all met last night to prepare And So I was like I thought they did, and some people are worried that they do not so some clarification actually on the gates at First Avenue along the street and whether those are opening closing gates, which is what we were sort of hoping for We do not know unless you're envisioning, some sort of fence or something it seems to us.
It was unclear to us whether that has a swinging gate to open and close, which may or may not be necessary, depending on the gates on First Avenue and just a note to ensure that any fence is low and that visibility from the playground to the comfort station is completely totally clear so that grown- ups can very easily see their kids moving between the playground and the bathrooms.
It's- I love community feedback, That's our job right now, We're really going to be focusing on those comments here, but it's not lost on us that this relates to other aspects of the play area, but we really need your help in deciding how to proceed with the playground.
That would really help us to help you so next slide, please, as you may recall, in February of 2020 community members selected the playground area as the top priority at the meeting there and then last month we shared a schematic plan with this committee, which received a vote of approval.
This slide shows the comments we received at our community input meeting back in February, and these are the comments that helped us develop a design for the playground.
As stated previously, we informed the community that the multi- purpose area already has plans for the installation of synthetic turf, which Steve also just went into a little bit more detail just before this, just to note that it would most likely be installed in the spring of next year.
We have the multi- purpose area slated for turf the playground towards the east, a comfort station and preschool, and to the east of that is the garden and two main entrances from first Avenue ramp up into the playground, and the existing playground has swings to the north and South A large play equipment is in the center of the space and divides it.
We actually heard a lot of comments about how some of those entrances were unsafe, that people congregate there and smoke, and actually currently it requires going over some random block and through playground, equipment.
The 2- 5 play area opens up just below and there is a generous bike and scooter area to the West and south and to the south of that there's more seating areas and a cozy seven foot height swing.
The following comment received is combining the scooter and bike area with the playground takes up too much space.
Alternative features for this area can still be tire swings, perhaps picnic tables and playhouses for small children, and these are the three options: we'd like you to consider the large track, area, partial track and no track next, we'll discuss.
There will be fewer trees, less plant beds and less of a buffer between what we're calling the bike and scooter track area now option Three expands the swing area on both sides, so this allows for nine swings in total and the impact is two fewer trees, fewer benches and no planted buffer between the street entrance and the swings option.
We could put more if desires, so I just want to point out that they are here in the 5 to 12 area, and these are the images of the play equipment that the community provided.
One was a piece of equipment that we considered several months ago in the design, but it was found to be too large to fit in the space while meeting safety, standards.
If this is something you'd like to see in the play, equipment, okay, site, furniture, the comments that we had for site, furniture, we're having benches facing the playground confirming whether existing picnic tables will remain and that some of the small tables wo not address community needs.
We appreciate the comment about us addressing the safety concerns regarding the removal of the concrete steps to make this big shower accessible, but we know that, however, you also kind of like the future of the steps, because they allow children to put their toys and buckets other things on those ledges.
Please let us know what you'd like to see and whether or not you'd want to remove plant beds for extra benches and, if you'd, like all the existing picnic tables to remain near the comfort station and finally, whether or not you like to have larger play equipment with decks and platforms that interface with climbing equipment.
And we're all cleared and grubbed in the new design and new plants It would make that area also just a little bit more accessible and not overgrown , It'd, be kind of a better managed, site, and then the second question I had is- I know that you're looking at just this area, but it We closed one of the entrance ways into the playground, itself, meaning there's two major entrance ways that come up in front of the school Area, meaning maybe tire swings, could go in one of those areas or something like that so as to maximize our overall space, so That would require some additional funding and planning.
I'm, not sure that area really lends itself I do not know that it lends itself to having any plague equipment, but we'll talk that over and come back to you in November, okay, all right.
Another option is to have a partial track for bikes and scooters, and a small area for tire swings- And I, just like to preface that with the multi- purpose area at this point is going to be, is going to be It's, going to have synthetic turf installed.
Because I understand from a conversation that our long- term planning director had with molly today, there may be an alternative possibility for for an area where the kids could be bike and do scootering I'd like to say one thing: First, I would encourage everybody to get involved with friends of the park, because in that way going forward you will have a voice more of a voice.
That's a fresh, direct and Amazon unloading, loading, zone, and You know we really it's a large street And we would love to see the bikes and the scooters use that space.
There is this, you know a lane of traffic or whatever that's a staging area, but the street is so wide that it still leaves a lot of room We can find out when that's when the gear and the equipment is moved from that block, but even if it's there, it still leads lends itself for bikes and scooters for sure and pickleball.
Additional tire swings from this other half the area that we're we would no longer be doing scootering so just as maybe consider option two or do other objections, as my proposal for how to move forward on this If we're doing this now, it probably makes sense to you, know, have have the parents who are in the community members who are on the call raise their hand to share their thoughts about these options, because we have not discussed these options.
So we really appreciate it when I'm looking at these three options and given our conversations, we all sort of agreed and correct me from wrong Erica that the scooting space just does not seem safe inside the park and even all the pictures that were shown were little kids.
Also that the multi- purpose area adjacent to it is going to be turf, but that that's not an alternative for bike and scootering.
Option three would be to lose plant beds on either side, so there's two fewer trees that will be able to be planted in total fewer benches, no planted buffer between the street entrance and swings and no planted buffer between the swings and the square area.
Let me speak to that real quickly, and the swings that you have now I mentioned earlier in the presentation: Do not meet safety regulations so, and that applies specifically to ADA swings and Straps swings for older children and because we have so many existing trees on site.
So, okay, I think we're all thumbs up on the fact that we want more swings rather than new trees in that space, and I.
Think We have two I want to respect you know, what's new to fruity for the community, that needs ADA, accessible equipment, and so that's a challenging, decision, And I guess we would have to rely on John on your conversation with them to really hone in on.
If you want, because that's one of the few areas within the playground that does not have a lot of constraints because there's not a lot of trees around it, so you would lose a spray shower.
We wanted some of these areas to be open so that you know they could be accessed.
For appearances, I, mean, I know our community has no green space, but I do not think the playground is necessary that in the community, because we really do not have open space either, and so we want to maximize using the lands for play.
We love the way that it is the little kids at like area with the house.
I, do not know if you addressed this, but in the little kid area, I might need to see the slide.
I do not know the little kid area currently, when you just said, clubhouse.
I know we're not talking about the turf, but you had said: hey like you might get 36th street.
Another issue here: There is just the conversation about the water area, but it sounds like John knows what we're looking for yeah right and making sure erico.
One thing we said it looks like there is a water fill station or a water fountain that will be in the turf area as well.
As long as I can remember, is gates that close on first avenue, because I do not know how we're going to control that gate area between the comfort, station.
Yes, the existing picnic tables that are going to remain we're going to be relocating two of them, maybe Ben, can bring up a more appropriate slide, will be fenced outside of the playground with the comfort station, so it'll be a place where you can watch and see, wait for someone who's coming out of the conversation Or, you can have a bigger party, but it's meant to be more of an adult area, so this might clarify it.
Most comments, I've heard is about making sure that there's space for riding bikes, so I think it's a valid point that Alfonso makes So we are, as per the vote, that we took a little bit earlier That was not up on the screen, we're going to try to make it work with even more straps than the options we show on the screen.
