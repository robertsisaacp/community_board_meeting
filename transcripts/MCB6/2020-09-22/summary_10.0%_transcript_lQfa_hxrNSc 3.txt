The way we use things is that the chat feature is more for like technology support, while the q a feature is for any case that that a member of the public has any questions.
You could find you could go to the district 4 town hall, which is November 5th, that's district 4 is up, is in harlem and there's one tomorrow at district 30 in Queens with the chancellor, but the one that would be most relevant to people on this call and in our district would be with the community education council for district 2, which is why I've circled it Next that we do the next slide, the next, the next opportunity to exp for people to express their opinions and views on the how the reopening of schools has been handled would be at the panel for educational policy, which is actually meeting a week from tomorrow night on September 30th at six o'clock.
If you can follow the link to this, it's quite an extensive guide to reopening of the schools that the DOE is providing and what they regard as helpful tips to families And so you're, getting a preview of it a couple of weeks before it's actually made public Also, a new online parent, organizing resource called inside schools, plus it's designed by a team at inside schools for new york city families.
You know one of the things if I'm saying something, that's obvious to everyone, but those of us involved in this know that once they decided to go to the blended model, they quickly discovered that not that having some students in and other students, not in meant that you could only have about you, know most kids in school, one or two days a week in some cases.
That leads to the question of how do you provide enrichment activities and child care on days when a kid is scheduled for remote learning, but mom and dad are you know, mom and mom or dad, and dad still have to have to go to work?
One of the things I want us to do as a committee is follow up on a suggestion that was made by ben kaylos during our full board meeting last week.
They're all working These people are working 14-hour days just trying to get their schools open and ready for ready for kids.
The most difficult meeting we had emotionally for me and excuse me every year was when we would have the people from school nutrition come, and you became aware of how many kids in this in our city, the only hot meal they get a day.
This was literally presented this afternoon by the office of family and community empowerment to all cecs across the city, and this is the most up-to-date information that we have on school openings and any questions that don't shoot the messenger.
Claude, has a lot of experience with this, so you know any questions that any of us can answer or would like me to raise to people.
I. Think one of my kids schools did a much better job of the remote learning than the other, but any other comments or questions or thoughts that we from people who are here.
I think so you know having access to the zooms is really the most important asset of school working and the DOE has what they call the teach hub and everything flows through their teach, hub, and so for many students.
People were like forget it, especially kids, who need extra support.
You know at the community board we do put requests in for the both your school as well as the homeless, population.
Is, the mental health impact of kovitz, so we're working with councilmember rivera's office to get an elvie any thinking you have on this as someone so familiar in nazi with our hospitals I would really like to do some a roundtable of some sort with people, mental health professionals, who are very who are close to the impact that this has had on people Do that in our October meeting, and I welcome any ideas or suggestions from any members of the the committee or public as we move ahead with that, we can do a focus group meeting, Well, I would like to have some parents who are willing that guardians who are willing to talk, because this is sensitive, stuff, usually personally, but certainly have some mental health professionals from one of our hospitals.
There was an incident where kids were going out late at night, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, one o'clock, and they were mugging folks on first avenue, especially mugging, both patients and visitors, to the hospitals as well as staff, and so that instigated us actually building a relationship with the center and having them come to the health and education committee on a quarterly basis, so that we had a relationship.
Some, great programming, like I, mean claude, actually, is helping them, enrich their library, they're, doing programs, something called freedom school and all these things.
I would like to say that I think this is you know our role as the board is to support them, but also we need to make sure the information that they're giving us goes out to the rest of just not only health and education, but full board.
I would would love it if you could at next full board just mention some of those numbers, because I think people don't understand like how much they're doing and we need to help build that kind of awareness.
We had a representative, we had from the DOT The buses pull up on the south on the south side of the street, and you know drop off these district 75 kids, many of whom need assistance just to get it just to get across for older new business Is it possible john, like maybe we can have the office staff look into both 59 and 116's request, with got One thing I will say, is at september's joint meeting between the transportation and the health and education committee.
