Is that the chat feature is more for like technology support, While the Q&A feature is for any case that that a member of the public has any questions, they can ask questions to the Q&A feature and actually, speaking of the Q&A feature, I see.
You could find you could go to the district 4 town hall, which is November 5th, that's district 4 is up, is in Harlem and there's one tomorrow at district 30 in Queens with the chancellor, but the one that would be most relevant to people on this call and in our district would be with the Community Education Council for District 2, which is why I've circled it Next that we do the the next, the next opportunity to exp for people to express their opinions and views on the how the reopening of schools has been handled would be at the panel for educational policy, which is actually meeting a week from tomorrow night on September 30th at six o'clock.
If you can follow the link to this, it's quite an extensive guide to reopening of the schools that the DOE is providing and what they regard as helpful tips to families And so you're, getting a preview of it a couple of weeks before it's actually made public Also, a new online parent, organizing resource called inside schools, plus it's designed by a team at inside schools for New York, City, families.
That leads to the question of how do you provide enrichment activities and child care on days when a kid is scheduled for remote learning, but mom and dad are you know, mom and mom or dad, and dad still have to have to go to work?
They're all working These people are working 14-hour days just trying to get their schools open and ready for ready for kids.
Know, student absences due to Covid-19 kids Get sent home during the day and because they have they're running a temperature or not feeling well, when a staff or faculty member is absent, And they think Covid-19 might be involved or if it's just set home during the day, do the illness self- reported to the school.
They won't open until a week from next Learning will be next week on the first of October This was a big concern, as you probably know that they would not have the buses ready and bus drivers and the people who look out for the kids.
I do not like the term matrons so, but the people who look out for the kids on the buses and once again they're going to instruct parents to go into your child's New York City, schools, Account, and I have that on the next page.
The most difficult meeting we had emotionally for me and excuse me every year was when we would have the people from school nutrition come, and you became aware of how many kids in this in our city, the only hot meal they get a day.
This was literally presented this afternoon by the Office of family and community empowerment to all Cecs Acrosss, This is the most up- to- date- information that we have on school openings and any questions that do not shoot the messenger.
Claude, has a lot of experience with this, so you know any questions that any of us can answer or would like me to raise to people.
I. Think one of my kids schools did a much better job of the remote learning than the other, but any other comments or questions or thoughts that we from people who are here.
Some schools have bathrooms in the in the classroom, but we're not even talking about kids going to the bathroom A myriad of concerns that the people in the schools would have I do not always agree with the uft on everything it says, but the uft really stepped to the plate here and took the heat and pushed you know pushed this with the with central and with the mayor, and I think.
I know that the Ps 116 staff has been working really hard to improve on the experience from last school year and they've done a great job.
I think so you know having access to the zooms is really the most important asset of school working and the DOE has what they call the teach hub and everything flows through their teach, hub, and so for many students.
You know and you lose people like, Can You have a sense for how many families showed chose hybrid versus remote It was less than half for full remote when we first started talking with the school about a month or three weeks before school started, but then that number started increasing so with more remote staying home That's what I heard today either moving out of the city or moving over to G t programs, because spots opened up because families moved out or going into Pri a lot to private schools, because people when they kept moving the school start.
I mean this news like the Big News is very frustrating if you're supportive of public schools and that's something that's important to you, it's devastating, but if you're looking at the microcosm of the kids who have stayed in the system who have access to the internet at 1:16, there's a lot of warm exciting things happening on a daily basis.
There was an incident where kids were going out late at night, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, one o'clock, and they were mugging folks on First Avenue, especially mugging, both patients and visitors, to the hospitals as well as staff, and so that instigated us actually building a relationship with the center and having them come to the health and Education Committee on a quarterly basis, so that we had a relationship.
I would like to say that I think this is you know our role as the board is to support them, but also we need to make sure the information that they're giving us goes out to the rest of just not only health and education, but full board.
I would would love it if you could at next full board just mention some of those numbers, because I think people do not understand like how much they're doing and we need to help build that kind of awareness.
The buses, pull up on the south on the south side of the street, and you know drop off these district 75 kids, many of whom need assistance just to get it just to get acrosss for older new business Is it possible John, like maybe we can have the office staff look into both 59 and 116's request with got One thing I will say, is at September's joint meeting between the transportation and the health and Education Committee.
