It is September 9th 2020 and we are starting the meeting at 702 and we are joined tonight by Sima Shaw, our secretary and the district manager, Jesus Perez Assistant district manager, Cody, Ostermann and Community I hope some people were able to take a nice.
We have a great group on the east side of Manhattan, so our neighbors and our community leaders as well- And I hope some of those folks are on the call tonight, but I did want to just do a shout out to the people that are Might, be on the call that have not been to a community board meeting before It changes And you can be updated on the committee events.
It's, just a question, it's not the business of the board, so it might just be a technical question for the the staff, The office team We've gone through this enough that we know this part, but the public is speaking and we've sent out notices, but we have some public folks asking to speak tonight, so I think they've, mostly registered You, know inviting people to speak after the next piece, here, which is the elected official.
And I want to thank new Yorkers who are working from home and in person during this pandemic, in particular city workers, who have kept our city.
They did not bother surveying the auditorium, and So, if you're interested I'm happy to partner with you, I'm, making sure we have the support we need for the schools if there have been many concerns about homeless and public safety, we're here to help.
We join the New York State nurses, Association, advocating for New York presbyterian to reopen its inpatient psychiatric services to help our mentally ill off the streets they serve about 600 folks.
We work with partners in the faith and nonprofit communities who are doing direct outreach, such as running soup, kitchens, directly assist individuals, the most effective way to end our homeless crisis will be to build more affordable housing and supportive housing.
And I think all the issues there are some schools in your district that are not going to be open.
We, are going to be circulating in our newsletter, which comes out every thursday how to get vetted by the New York City Department of Education, so that you can then be an assistant to those who are learning online or those who are using remote, period.
We talked to the New York City Board of elections, and we found out that 35,000 manhattanites, I'm sure plenty on board six move temporarily, understandably, and they are now going to get a postcard from actually the League of women.
If you have to second, in addition to that, we sent in the borough, Manhattan 140,000 postcards, maybe a month ago and just recently, another 140,000 to those that are on the lowest performing census, tracks, some of them board six, some of them in board five, some of them on board eight, and certainly some on board one in the financial district.
So, if you have some suggestions for that, let me know: post sites are a problem, we're trying to make sure that they are not schools, because I know all those issues either for the pre- voting or the voting day.
This mirror is going to have apparently 400 people doing some of the monitoring we'll see if that works, and I think you know as much about it as I.
It would provide new commercial rent relief and the obligation the rent obligation of covered tenants, Covid-19 impacted small businesses and Not- for- Profits would be limited under this legislation to the lesser of 20 of their actual income in a given month or one- third of their contractual rent, payments, landlords have covered.
You've probably been reading about the fact that a number of my colleagues, including me, have made a number of different proposals to tax the very higher echelons of New York state taxpayers to pay for these types of services and rental relief programs that are in such dire need.
President was there to decry this turn, because it really, I think, sends a terrible message that if you just threaten a lawsuit against this city, administration, on the issue of homelessness, which is so fraught with, you know, specific community concerns and the city capitulates as they did in this instance.
Just yesterday, has issued an executive order that requires local boards of elections to make plans that allow new yorkers to drop off ballots at some board of election and pull sites.
So, thanks for having me, I hope everyone had a good summer and is getting ready for back to school, which has been pushed back until September 21st Chair of the education committee, is calling for the delay in the start of school.
September 30th we'll be monitoring that, but we'll also be working on other things to help small businesses Inc, including the personal liability protections currently passed.
A bill and City Council passed a bill about preventing landlords from coming after the personal liability of small business owners and commercial leases and we're hearing an extension of that bill.
You know proposed the small business recovery leaks program with a couple of his colleagues in Albany and Councilman Brad lander in Brooklyn, which would allow for commercial leases for businesses, essentially to renegotiate their leases with their landlords to get them reduced and the landlords will get a property tax break for a period as a way to compensate for that, because that's the one of the real obstacles here just want to touch.
Probably, all aware of the everything happening with the Vanderbilt Y, I know, councilman powers has been: we've set up meetings with the Middle Y and Department of Homeland Services friends of dead camera school plaza, the Turtle Bay Association.
Just trying to keep the lines of communication as open there as possible and make it as transparent as possible and make the whole situation work as well as possible because being a good neighbor goes both ways, and it's really important that the community is is welcoming and that site is successful, because our right to shelter law is just so pivotal and we do not.
As, a community board, we've been in touch with city Hall, I'm not going to stop emailing them until we get an actual response on that and on the on the election.
I will just skip over that, but somebody remember Godfrey, is, of course, a sponsor in the assembly of that bill regarding the Covid-19 pandemic, as any public health authority would confirm to feeding the virus is going to depend on testing and contact tracing, but that is not going to work unless all the people are confident that the information that they give to contact tracers is not going to be used against them by immigration authorities or provided to entities like insurance companies or marketing firms.
Therefore, somebody member gottfried, introduced a bill to protect the confidentiality of conflict contact tracing for Covid-19, along with New York State Senate Health Committee Chair, Gustavo Rivera.
The people want to know it's 810,901, along with Senator Hoyleman, and the bill really focuses on rent relief for small businesses.
We were in session and we did some work and one of the things we did actually In June was friendly for residential tenants, but we did nothing for our commercial tenants and if we want to keep the 29,000 restaurants, the tens of thousands of small businesses, the local card store the nail salon in the yarn store either bodega we're going to need real rent relief, so that bill really is a critical piece of legislation that we've been pushing, along with coalitions from all over the city in the state and hope, What's, reasonable, customary charges for people who are unstabilized, what we passed in 2019 limited, the major capital improvements, two percent of the cost, two percent of the Mci to add on to a rent.
As mentioned that someone gottfried had we had hearing yesterday, yesterday's on people with disabilities and the struggles that people with disabilities are having through the Covid-19 epidemic, and we know how much Covid-19 has really impacted communities of color, but people with disabilities, as you know, with a only with a 70 unemployment rate prior to Covid-19, they're, really getting hit, and so we really need to focus on how we support the disability community, both in education, employment and other opportunities and finally.
Our office has still been working on thousands of unemployment, cases, people who are stuck waiting or experiencing issues with their unemployment insurance benefits.
I think it was about two weeks ago, now, at this point, even though every day has been the same, the comptroller, as well as Congressman Adriano Espaiot, sent a joint letter to the City Department of Sanitation and the Department of Health and Mental hygiene calling on the city to take immediate steps to address the overflowing water baskets and increase rat sightings along the city's commercial corridors, citing dozens of complaints from business, owners.
Our city is in the midst of a deadly pandemic, congressman, especially Comptroller stringer, proposed recommendations to remedy the untenable piles of trash accumulating in our city, streets, sidewalks and public spaces, including working with business, improvement, districts and business owners to provide flexibility to businesses that want to add street bins at their own expense and broadening the clean Curbs Pilot program.
The controllers plan called on the city in partnership with the philanthropic community, to build out one and a half miles each of protected bike lanes around 50 New York City high school buildings in the next year and to provide free bicycles or CitiBike memberships to every low, income.
The comptroller's bike school proposal offers a safe and efficient transportation option for New York City's young people I'll leave it at that I'll.
You know, recently, the public advocate in our office actually has been heavily involved in the school reopening fight.
Partly pushing and reimagining how we should open schools and disagreeing with the mayor and laying out a plan in July, as well as supporting the you know, teachers and calling out the mayor when, in regards to the lack of preparedness, so part of that led to being a vocal critic on this reopening plan and really calling for there to be a delay until October based upon the safety standards and the infrastructure needs being met.
So, we've really tried to position that listening to science like let's be safe and cautious and actually push back for some of that And we're seeing you know some of the infrastructure issues remain in these days that make us really cautious this time.
So that was passed recently in the City Council, and the public advocate was a co- sponsor and when we think about the school reopening and just dealing with the issues of schools, we our office and the public advocate introduced, two.
Then it's not an abundance of people, but I agree if that, if it's indeed you know all in agreement and some a similar topic in a similar, you know in support of or Our first speaker is Pete Harrison He's a district resident and lives at stytown He wants to speak in support of density, reduction, hotel sites for the homeless.
The homeless, but right now our neighborhood of kids Bay, is really heavily residential and very small, whereas Jacob Javits is really set up for this kind of thing, and even though it was not maximized to its benefit for as a Kobe, 19, hospital, I think it will work as housing.
That's just something to consider and certainly, like the last speaker, said, open to solutions, but my larger concern is to have some accounting from the city and or state as to who is actually living in these hotels and maybe not by name but Just.
How many people are there and what kind of crimes have they been convicted of all right, thanks very much for listening and have a good night great thanks, evan, there's one more She did not give her affiliation, so Miss nestor Chuck, if you can state your affiliation when you start speaking, we'd appreciate that I'll enable your mic.
And I join those deep concerns, and I just want people to know who are feeling a sense of fear that they're that I'm, that I'm listening and the committee is listening quite seriously and that we plan to take action.
You, know issues about a personal space between people on the street because you know we live in a crowded city And, it's really hard when someone has a home base in a neighborhood and is also taking up space on a sidewalk And they're, interacting with other people and people And, it's something that we can work.
It offends me, but it's also completely not a legal, concern, and I think that we need as a community, to talk our way through that with our neighbors to let them know where certain public safety issues are good grounds for us to discuss and try to work through and where certain other stuff really crosses the line and adds too much of an unfair burden to that.
Folks that are on the street, are in the shelters and you know, do not have a lot of open space to go during the day.
If you as a community organization as a as a block, can find a church can find a synagogue can find a willing facility in your neighborhood that is able to open up their restrooms for our people that are experiencing homelessness.
I do not know how it'll work this year, but I recommend that folks get involved, because you learn a lot about the street homeless and the barriers to getting into shelters similar to what's been mentioned.
Where do you go to the bathroom Do you find a place to to seek shelter these basic things that we take for granted, And so I think this community is actually in a very strong place over the next weeks and months and with the amazing event, that's going to happen in a couple weeks to actually lead the city in discussions about this and to uphold the dignity of our homeless neighbors, because we are again a generous district that is welcome and homeless in this district.
Think we have solution for Charles or Sema will ask Charles who's just here tonight by phone to for his vote for things at the end of the meeting, but go ahead and as you.
If you clicked on it, you can select your name from the list of board members and then select your vote for each resolution do not hit submit until we finish the all the resolutions As, the Father parent of two kids in New, York City, Public schools, I've, been very attuned to all of the issues that are, you know plaguing the reopening of schools.
So we'd like in our own way here to to try to address that and borough president Brewer mentioned tutoring, and I know some of our high schools are actively working to to tutor kids.
So please vote on resolution, seven, a supporting, closing second avenue bicycling gap and sandy for 7B, and this also came to us at the July meeting And it's a proposal for crosstown bike lanes of 38th and 39th street and they have been temporary and now the DOT is actually working to implement them.
So, you know what we can do is we do have some people that need to vote verbally at the end.
We'll, get back to that lou, for, if you're unable to vote And, it's a proposal to build a pedestrian and bicycle bridge that would connect Queens to Manhattan understanding that we do not have the money for this now, it's a bit of a long shot, but it's something that seems like a great idea and many other cities are building these types of bridges and since we're the we We're the place where a lot of cars land, we thought it's a good idea to actually have bicycles and pedestrians land.
So this is a resolution asking the police precincts to actually open up the streets for public uses.
This is to reinforce that letter and also it's in support of the letter that Manhattan borough president Gail Brewer wrote- We have been talking to the commanding officers, so we're working with them, but They're just not open and they were invited to speak tonight.
You know to come to some of our meetings, and so I hope they attend our housing, homeless and human rights.
Please vote on 7d, asking local precincts to quit, blocking the streets sandy and then our next resolution actually Ann and Andrew work together on this one It's to assess the utilization of metered parking in Midtown East and there it was notice that there's because of the particular configuration very residential that we may want to look more closely at how parking is used in this neighborhood and if there are any questions, either Ann or Andrew can answer them.
There was actually an article in the New York Times that Jim shared with our committee actually spoke on it because his local delhi was actually affected by this, and this was actually something that was happening in other states as well, where the business was listed as closed, even though they were open.
We actually had a resolution that we had passed over the summer about having the city and state put together a plan for indoor dining which we had to pull out because.
But I do have to thank everybody on the committee for first of all meeting throughout the summer and all of the work they did on that.
But it's an interesting report and Of, That's obviously live in terms of plans and initiatives, so at our next community, Board or next committee meeting at the end of September, we'll be discussing a lot of these things, of course, by then, hopefully, we'll get more information on the indoor, dining plan.
Meeting, and so I encourage everybody to attend, and one of the great things is that a lot of our work was influenced by a lot of people from the public, but also other community board members from other committees who have been witnessing and experiencing things and providing their perspective to the conversation.
So I would encourage people to continue to do that as well, and that's all I have Thank you very much, All right, so Pam Vassell, Chair, Parks landmarks and cultural affairs Yes, okay, good, so I do not have much to say except to report on one thing, which is the Saint Vorton's redesign of the playground, There was a kind of a hoo- ha which we did not know about until after the meeting was over, but there were like 40 people who were grousing about one thing or another, so we tried to figure out a way in which we could listen to the things they wanted to suggest or the questions that they had.
Thank you and if you have, if you have not voted just, let me know, I'm going to he needs to vote.
