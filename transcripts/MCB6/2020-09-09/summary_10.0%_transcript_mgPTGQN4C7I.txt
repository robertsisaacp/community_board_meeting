I say that every time, but we do have a lot to cover tonight, since we were on break for the summer, I'm molly, hollister, Manhattan community board, six chair, jesus perez assistant, district manager, cody, ostermann and community, associate brendan burth, who are an amazing team and before I start the meeting and set the ground rules and do the you know start this elected speaking.
We have a great group on the east side of Manhattan, so our neighbors and our community leaders as well- Some of those folks are on the call tonight, but I did want to just do a shout out to the people that are might be on the call that haven't been to a community board meeting before It changes and you can be updated on the committee events.
We are all home and I want to thank new yorkers who are working from home and in person during this pandemic, in particular city workers, who have kept our city running , we fought off the mayor's most recent threats of layoffs and we continue to fight to restore 20 million dollars, cut from nonprofits, offering food, shelter and services to youth and seniors As. Chair of the contracts committee, I've been reviewing contracts that can be cut or went wrong and I found hundreds of billions of dollars in contracts for our nation's largest corporations for things like white papers and I think we can cut the recent white paper on cyber security.
We also uncovered what was going on with the failure to deliver the air conditioning turns out the city had a huge fight with pc richards If pc richards is as reliable as they said, they would impression preparation for the school starting in september, we spent most of the summer with our parents, principals, teachers and We had a hearing, sorry town hall last night, with deputy education department, chancellor department of education, deputy chancellor austin, who answered questions on test testing safety plans, remote learning, If, you missed it, you can see it at facebookcom, benkaylo videos, I would just say if you have an education committee and you're interested I pulled one school and I've been in that school.
We've built multiple buildings in my district, including across the street in my backyard, and the children from the supportive housing are now going to school at the school that my daughter is zoned for, as november creeps, closer We, join activists throughout the nation to save the postal service and continue to battle a broken board of elections.
It It would provide new commercial rent relief and the obligation the rent obligation of covered tenants, Covid-19, 19, impacted small businesses and not-for-profits would be limited under this legislation to the lesser of 20 of their actual income in a given month or one-third of their contractual rent payments, landlords have covered Tenants would be required to waive 20 of the contractual rent and through this legislation the state would establish a commercial rent relief program consisting of money that we get from the federal government.
Pandemic related housing plans for homeless and The borough president was there to decry this turn, because it really I think sends a terrible message that if you just threaten a lawsuit against this city administration, on the issue of homelessness which is so fraught with, you know, specific community concerns and the city capitulates as they did in this instance.
She proposed 16 recommendations which I won't go over now, but she presented them at the state's joint committee hearing on hospital responses, and you can read that on the state's website or if you get our board report, there's a clickable link there and continuing the work at the city level and so we're doing a joint hearing with council member keith powers, the and the criminal justice committee on september 21st and then we'll be doing a hearing on the test and trace program on september 25th with councilmember mark levine and the health committee.
We fill it out so we're doing you know everything we can to get people to fill out the census This saturday september 12th at 12 pm at the two fifths, houses 444 second avenue and 3 30 east 26th street Thanks guys, all right, so ben jacobs from council member keith powers office is on the line.
I was going to go into a whole thing about how it's been six months since I've been in Manhattan and I've, been stuck in my one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn, but you have a clock running You know proposed the small business recovery leaks program with a couple of his colleagues in albany and councilman brad lander in Brooklyn, which would allow for commercial leases for businesses essentially to renegotiate their leases with their landlords to get them reduced and the landlords will get a property tax break for a period as a way to compensate for that, because that's the one of the real obstacles here just want to touch on Probably.
I know, councilman powers has been we've set up: meetings with the middle y and department of homeland services, friends of dead camera school, plaza, the turtle bay association just trying to keep the lines of communication as open there as possible and make it as transparent as possible and make the whole situation work as well as possible because being a good neighbor goes both ways, and it's really important that the community is is welcoming and that site is successful because our right to shelter law is just so pivotal and we don't As a community board.
We've been in touch with city hall, I'm not going to stop emailing them until we get an actual response on that and on the on the election I've gone out there and measured with their fancy laser measuring things and the distance, and all that we've got new poll sites open in cb6 at the ford foundation at the vanderbilt y, the stuyvesant town community center is a poll set again so that everyone inside town can vote inside town.
Therefore somebody member gottfried, introduced a bill to protect the confidentiality of conflict contact tracing for covid19, along with new york state senate health committee, chair gustavo rivera it passed both houses of the legislature in july and is awaiting the governor's signature.
It creates a strong imbalance between the two branches which are supposed to be co-equal, and he has introduced legislation to pass a constitutional amendment in new york state As, chair of the assembly health committee, he convened a hearing last month on Covid-19 a devastating toll in nursing homes around the state focused a lot of public attention on the crisis that happened during the pandemic, but it's something that assembly member godfrey has been focused on for many years.
Rent relief for small businesses in june was friendly for residential tenants, but we did nothing for our commercial tenants and if we want to keep the 29 000 restaurants, the tens of thousands of small businesses, the local card store the nail salon in the yarn store That bill really is a critical piece of legislation that we've been pushing along with coalitions from all over the city in the state and hope What's reasonable customary charges for people who are unstabilized what we passed in 2019 limited the major capital improvements, two percent of the cost, two percent of the mci to add on to a rent a year.
So I hope you all have access to that to understand what we're you know, what he's saying, what we're doing and what we're thinking about and any events that we have I think some members of the public that like to speak jesus, do you have the four people, but we do have the timer and then it's not an abundance of people, but I agree if that, if it's indeed you know all in agreement and some a similar topic in a similar, you know in support of or Our first speaker is pete harrison he's a district resident and lives at stytown, and he wants to speak in support of density reduction, hotel sites for the homeless , I hope you had a good summer, I guess in favor of housing the homeless, in hotels during covet 19 I.
But my larger concern is to have some accounting from the city and or state as to who is actually living in these hotels and maybe not by name but just how many people are there and what kind of crimes have they been convicted of all right, thanks very much for listening and have a good night great thanks, evan , there's one more if you can state your affiliation when you start speaking, we'd appreciate that I'll enable your mic.
Have all those issues coming with our next I'm, not even sure what the date is, but our next for that committee report and I just wanted to make sure that the my vote on I think it was resolutions 5a and 5b were- The vote's been changed, The minutes are adopted and my chairs report So I am going to waive my report except to say that I hear that it's sandy mckee's birthday today and that's all jesus district managers report, hello, everyone I'll be super quick, since we have a lot of to get through tonight.
I know we have a lot of challenges all right, so corinne vanderdonk, chair, housing, homeless and human rights molly, just really quick to let everyone thank you for any for the people that spoke during the public session about the housing of people in our temporary housing of people in our hotels in our district, we will be having a meeting on september 21st, where the only thing we will be discussing is exactly that.
No such law pertaining to that Applying that exact same standard to the homeless population It offends me, but it's also completely not a legal concern and I think that we need as a community, to talk our way through that with our neighbors to let them know where certain public safety issues are good grounds for us to discuss and try to work through and where certain other stuff really crosses the line and adds too much of an unfair burden to that population.
The homeless people who are sheltered in our community they're, our neighbors Folks that are on the street, are in the shelters and you know don't have a lot of open space to go during the day We should move the agenda, but corinne and jim We do ask people to try to find constructive solutions and to volunteer and help out, and so one of the things is that we would We are working on having a book drive for the to so that people can drop off books and puzzles and board games at the vanderbilt y for our new neighbors and when it comes to people having to use the restroom.
This is a problem that isn't going to go away unless we actually start providing public restrooms If you as a community organization as a as a block, can find a church can find a synagogue can find a willing facility in your neighborhood that is able to open up their restrooms for our people that are experiencing homelessness.
Recommend I, don't know how it'll work this year, but I recommend that folks get involved, because you learn a lot about the street homeless and the barriers to getting into shelters similar to what's been mentioned before I would just say that I found that one of the benefits of this community is that, in fact, we do have a shelter here and the largest facility housing, the homeless in the city, because I think it allows us to understand the challenges associated with that.
But it also allows us to I think more intimately understand the challenges associated with being homeless Do you find a place to to seek shelter these basic things that we take for granted and so I think this community is actually in a very strong place over the next weeks and months and with the amazing event, that's going to happen in a couple weeks to actually lead the city in discussions about this and to uphold the dignity of our homeless neighbors, because we are again a generous district that is welcome and homeless in this district That's all to say that I'm excited about what's being organized by the committee and again thank the folks who've, who have spoken thus far great thanks, joseph all, right so we'll move to sorry.
As, the father parent of two kids in new york city, public schools, I've been very attuned to all of the issues that are, you know plaguing the reopening of schools, and originally we have our next committee meeting on the 22nd Originally.
So please vote on resolution, seven, a supporting, closing second avenue bicycling gap and sandy for 7b, and this also came to us at the july meeting and it's a proposal for crosstown bike lanes of 38th and 39th street and they have been temporary and now the DOT is actually working to implement them.
So, you know what we can do is we do have some people that need to vote verbally at the end I'm able to access it, we'll get back to that lou for if you're unable to vote and it's a proposal to build a pedestrian and bicycle bridge that would connect Queens to Manhattan understanding that we don't have the money for this now We thought it's a good idea to actually have bicycles and pedestrians land here as well So many questions.
We need to vote so this is a resolution asking the police precincts to actually open up the streets for public uses.
I mean part of the problem with the barricades is that it's really in the police are completely inaccessible now, so it sets up I'm just since we're talking about it and talking about speaking to the police, Please vote on 7d, asking local precincts to quit, blocking the streets sandy and then our next resolution, actually ann and andrew work together on this one and it's to assess the utilization of metered parking in midtown east and there it was notice that there's because of the particular configuration very residential that we may want to look more closely at how parking is used in this neighborhood What the police say: riots So. We have to say that the police say riots and protests I mean they are concerned for their safety So. Our resolution does not say right all right, No one calling the question I'm going to just move for the vote.
There was actually an article in the new york times that jim shared with our committee actually spoke on it because his local delhi was actually affected by this, and this was actually something that was happening in other states as well, where the business was listed as closed, even though they were open So. The fact that we had heard this you wanted to make sure that no third-party app could do something of this nature, All right, please vote on 8b, 8c, so 8c To give background our committee was discussing a lot of things.
But I do have to thank everybody on the committee for first of all meeting throughout the summer and all of the work they did on that There were a couple of different programs that the city started over the summer The first one is something called mediating, establishment and neighbor disputes, and it's a city-wide initiative for free mediation and conflict resolution, as it relates to businesses and residents and quality of life issues.
But it's an interesting report and That's, obviously live in terms of plans and initiatives, so at our next community board or next committee meeting at the end of september, we'll be discussing a lot of these things, of course by then, hopefully, we'll get more information on the indoor dining plan Just, because it's an option doesn't mean that business owners feel comfortable hiring the amount of people that would be required to staff, indoor dining or the public health concerns.
So I thought it was best to pull that out, just as we were receiving more information about it, but we'll definitely be discussing that at our next committee meeting and so I encourage everybody to attend, and one of the great things is that a lot of our work was influenced by a lot of people from the public, but also other community board members from other committees who have been witnessing and experiencing things and providing their perspective to the conversation.
