It is September 9th 2020 and we are starting the meeting at 702 and we are joined tonight by sima shaw, our secretary and the district manager, jesus perez assistant, district manager, cody, ostermann and community associate brendan burth, who are an amazing team and before I start the meeting and set the ground rules and do the you know start this elected speaking.
We have a great group on the east side of Manhattan, so our neighbors and our community leaders as well- And I hope some of those folks are on the call tonight, but I did want to just do a shout out to the people that are Might, be on the call that haven't been to a community board meeting before It changes, and you can be updated on the committee events.
It's, just a question, it's not the business of the board, so it might just be a technical question for the the staff, The office team We've gone through this enough that we know this part, but the public is speaking and we've sent out notices, but we have some public folks asking to speak tonight, so I think they've, mostly registered You, know inviting people to speak after the next piece, here, which is the elected official.
And I want to thank new yorkers who are working from home and in person during this pandemic, in particular city workers, who have kept our city.
If you have an education committee and you're interested I pulled one school And I've been in that school If you're interested I'm happy to partner with you, I'm, making sure we have the support we need for the schools if there have been many concerns about homeless and public safety.
We work with partners in the faith and nonprofit communities who are doing direct outreach, such as running soup, kitchens, directly assist individuals, the most effective way to end our homeless crisis will be to build more affordable housing and supportive housing.
We, are going to be circulating in our newsletter, which comes out every thursday how to get vetted by the new york city department of education, so that you can then be an assistant to those who are learning online or those who are using remote, period.
We talked to the new york city board of elections, and we found out that 35 000 manhattanites Understandably, and they are now going to get a postcard from actually the league of women voters.
If you have some suggestions for that, let me know: post sites are a problem, we're trying to make sure that they are not schools, because I know all those issues either for the pre-voting or the voting day.
It would provide new commercial rent relief and the obligation the rent obligation of covered, tenants, Covid-19, 19, impacted small businesses and not-for-profits would be limited under this legislation to the lesser of 20 of their actual income in a given month or one-third of their contractual rent payments landlords have covered.
You've probably been reading about the fact that a number of my colleagues, including me, have made a number of different proposals to tax the very higher echelons of new york state taxpayers to pay for these types of services and rental relief programs that are in such dire need.
President was there to decry this turn because it really, I think, sends a terrible message that if you just threaten a lawsuit against this city, administration, on the issue of homelessness, which is so fraught with, you know, specific community concerns and the city capitulates as they did in this instance.
I, sponsor with assembly member dick godfrey that would allow the board of elections to create secure drop boxes throughout the state to collect ballots.
So, thanks for having me, I hope everyone had a good summer and is getting ready for back to school, which has been pushed back until September 21st carolina was very vocal with her colleagues in city council, including councilmember, mark trager, Chair of the education committee, is calling for the delay in the start of school.
September 30th, we'll be monitoring that, but we'll also be working on other things to help small businesses inc, including the personal liability protections currently passed.
Probably all aware of the everything happening with the vanderbilt y, I know, councilman powers has been we've set up meetings with the middle y and department of homeland, services, friends of dead camera, school, plaza, the turtle bay association, just trying to keep the lines of communication as open there as possible and make it as transparent as possible and make the whole situation work as well as possible because being a good neighbor goes both ways, and it's really important that the community is is welcoming and that site is successful because our right to shelter law is just so pivotal and we don't.
As a community board, we've been in touch with city hall, I'm, not going to stop emailing them until we get an actual response on that and on the on the election.
I've gone out there and measured with their fancy, laser measuring things and the distance, and all that we've got new poll sites open in cb6 at the ford foundation at the vanderbilt y, the stuyvesant town community center is a poll set again so that everyone inside town can vote inside town, the brookdale campus.
I will just skip over that, but somebody remember godfrey is, of course, a sponsor in the assembly of that bill regarding the Covid-19 pandemic, as any public health authority would confirm to feeding the virus is going to depend on testing and contact tracing, but that is not going to work unless all the people are confident that the information that they give to contact tracers is not going to be used against them by immigration authorities or provided to entities like insurance companies or marketing firms.
Therefore, somebody member gottfried, introduced a bill to protect the confidentiality of conflict contact tracing for Covid-19, along with new york state senate health, committee, chair, gustavo, rivera It, passed both houses of the legislature in July and is awaiting the governor's signature.
He convened a hearing last month on Covid-19 a devastating toll in nursing homes around the state focused a lot of public attention on the crisis that happened during the pandemic, but it's something that assembly member godfrey has been focused on for many years.
The people want to know it's 810 901, along with senator hoyleman, and the bill really focuses on rent relief for small businesses.
We were in session and we did some work and one of the things we did actually In June was friendly for residential tenants, but we did nothing for our commercial tenants and if we want to keep the 29 000 restaurants, the tens of thousands of small businesses, the local card store the nail salon in the yarn store, either bodega we're going to need real rent relief.
Our office has still been working on thousands of unemployment, cases, people who are stuck waiting or experiencing issues with their unemployment insurance benefits.
Our city is in the midst of a deadly pandemic, congressman, especially comptroller stringer, proposed recommendations to remedy the untenable piles of trash accumulating in our city, streets, sidewalks and public spaces, including working with business, improvement, districts and business owners to provide flexibility to businesses that want to add street bins at their own expense and broadening the clean curbs pilot, program.
The controllers plan called on the city in partnership with the philanthropic community, to build out one and a half miles each of protected bike lanes around 50 new york city high school buildings in the next year and to provide free bicycles or city bike memberships to every low-income public high school students with reductions in bus and subway service, school buses operating in extremely limited capacity in the computer and the continued need for social distancing on public transit.
The comptroller's bike school proposal offers a safe and efficient transportation option for new york city's young people.
So, you know, recently, the public advocate in our office actually has been heavily involved in the school reopening fight, so to speak, partly pushing and reimagining how we should open schools and disagreeing with the mayor and laying out a plan in July, as well as supporting the you know, teachers and calling out the mayor when, in regards to the lack of preparedness, so part of that led to being a vocal critic on this reopening plan and really calling for there to be a delay until October based upon the safety standards and the infrastructure needs being met.
So that was passed recently in the city council and the public advocate was a co-sponsor and when we think about the school reopening and just dealing with the issues of schools, we our office and the public advocate introduced two.
Then it's not an abundance of people, but I agree if that, if it's indeed you know all in agreement and some a similar topic in a similar, you know in support of or Our first speaker is pete harrison, he's a district resident and lives at stytown He wants to speak in support of density, reduction, hotel sites for the homeless.
So if jacob javits can be used as a Covid-19, hospital, I believe jacob javits is a viable alternative for housing, the homeless, but right now our neighborhood of kids bay is really heavily residential and very small, whereas jacob javits is really set up for this kind of thing, and even though it wasn't maximized to its benefit for as a kobe 19, hospital, I think it will work as housing.
That's just something to consider and certainly, like the last speaker, said, open to solutions, but my larger concern is to have some accounting from the city and or state as to who is actually living in these hotels and maybe not by name but Just.
How many people are there and what kind of crimes have they been convicted of all right, thanks very much for listening and have a good night great thanks, evan, there's one more If. You can state your affiliation when you start speaking, we'd appreciate that I'll enable your mic.
So I am going to waive my report except to say that I hear that it's sandy mckee's birthday today, And, that's all jesus district managers, report, hello, everyone I'll, be super quick, since we have a lot of to get through tonight, Cb6 members, as you all know, every wednesday the cb6 office sends you an email with helpful updates, fittingly called the wednesday email.
The vote will be taken next month, at which time the candidates will have an opportunity to speak if they wish, but I'm, going to go through each of the offices and ask if anyone would like to nominate themselves or someone else for that.
I. Just simply just wanted to say the comments that, as a member of that committee to those people who spoke, I really hear them.
And I join those deep concerns, and I just want people to know who are feeling a sense of fear that they're that I'm, that I'm listening and the committee is listening quite seriously and that we plan to take action.
You know issues about a personal space between people on the street because you know we live in a crowded city And, it's really hard when someone has a home base in a neighborhood and is also taking up space on a sidewalk And they're, interacting with other people and people And, it's something that we can work.
It offends me, but it's also completely not a legal, concern, and I think that we need as a community, to talk our way through that with our neighbors to let them know where certain public safety issues are good grounds for us to discuss and try to work through and where certain other stuff really crosses the line and adds too much of an unfair burden to that.
Folks that are on the street, are in the shelters and you know don't have a lot of open space to go during the day.
If you as a community organization as a as a block, can find a church can find a synagogue can find a willing facility in your neighborhood that is able to open up their restrooms for our people that are experiencing homelessness.
I'm, actually wearing my hope, t-shirt, which is a part of the DHS annual account of the homeless in the city, and I recommend I, don't know how it'll work this year, but I recommend that folks get involved, because you learn a lot about the street homeless and the barriers to getting into shelters similar to what's been mentioned.
Do you find a place to to seek shelter these basic things that we take for granted, and so I think this community is actually in a very strong place over the next weeks and months and with the amazing event, that's going to happen in a couple weeks to actually lead the city in discussions about this and to uphold the dignity of our homeless neighbors, because we are again a generous district that is welcome and homeless in this district.
As, the father parent of two kids in new york, city, public schools, I've, been very attuned to all of the issues that are, you know plaguing the reopening of schools, and originally we have our next committee meeting on the 22nd.
So we'd like in our own way here to to try to address that and borough president brewer mentioned tutoring, and I know some of our high schools are actively working to to tutor kids.
So please vote on resolution, seven, a supporting, closing second avenue bicycling gap and sandy for 7b, and this also came to us at the July meeting It's a proposal for crosstown bike lanes of 38th and 39th street and they have been temporary and now the DOT is actually working to implement them.
So, you know what we can do is we do have some people that need to vote verbally at the end.
If you were having an issue: okay, all right, so We'll get back to that lou, for if you're unable to vote And, it's a proposal to build a pedestrian and bicycle bridge that would connect Queens to Manhattan understanding that we don't have the money for this now We thought it's a good idea to actually have bicycles and pedestrians land here as well.
We need to vote So. This is a resolution asking the police precincts to actually open up the streets for public uses.
This is to reinforce that letter and also it's in support of the letter that Manhattan borough president gail brewer wrote- We have been talking to the commanding officers, so we're working with them, but They're just not open and they were invited to speak tonight.
And I think it's important for the full board to know that They did respond to me just in conversations, but you know it was just at a build a block meeting a few weeks ago They have some safety concerns, so I've asked them.
You know to come to some of our meetings, and so I hope they attend our housing, homeless and human rights.
Please vote on 7d, asking local precincts to quit, blocking the streets sandy and then our next resolution, actually ann and andrew work together on this one It's to assess the utilization of metered parking in midtown east It was notice that there's because of the particular configuration very residential that we may want to look more closely at how parking is used in this neighborhood.
There was actually an article in the new york times that jim shared with our committee actually spoke on it because his local delhi was actually affected by this, and this was actually something that was happening in other states as well, where the business was listed as closed, even though they were open.
We, actually had a resolution that we had passed over the summer about having the city and state put together a plan for indoor dining which we had to pull out because.
But I do have to thank everybody on the committee for first of all meeting throughout the summer and all of the work they did on that.
But it's an interesting report and Of, That's obviously live in terms of plans and initiatives, so at our next community board or next committee meeting at the end of September, we'll be discussing a lot of these things, of course, by then, hopefully, we'll get more information on the indoor, dining plan.
And, so I encourage everybody to attend, and one of the great things is that a lot of our work was influenced by a lot of people from the public, but also other community board members from other committees who have been witnessing and experiencing things and providing their perspective to the conversation.
Thank, you very much, all right, so pam vassell, chair, parks, landmarks and cultural affairs, Yes, okay, good, so I don't have much to say except to report on one thing, which is the saint vorton's redesign of the playground, There was a kind of a hoo-ha which we didn't know about until after the meeting was over, but there were like 40 people who were grousing about one thing or another, so we tried to figure out a way in which we could listen to the things they wanted to suggest or the questions that they had And and we'll be able to talk about it and hopefully write a resolution and move forward.
