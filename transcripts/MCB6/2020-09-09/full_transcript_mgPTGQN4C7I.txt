And finding me so adorable: this is his first community board meeting so cute. Thank you for bringing it michael, of course, which one before do you live in and can gail or I appoint you your child to one of the communities, unfortunately we're up in the Bronx in cb11, so different borough. Oh your baby's! So cute how old he just turned eight months this past weekend. Wow! Does he do any tricks yet he's learning some tricks at daycare? He just started daycare last week. Really he was doing finger painting already. Let's get started you guys, so we have a big agenda. I probably I feel like a broken record. I say that every time, but we do have a lot to cover tonight, since we were on break for the summer. So, let's see I we're recording we're ready to go so welcome everyone. I'm molly, hollister Manhattan community board six chair. It is september 9th 2020 and we are starting the meeting at 702 and we are joined tonight by sima shaw, our secretary and the district manager, jesus perez assistant, district manager, cody, ostermann and community associate brendan burth, who are an amazing team and before I start the meeting and set the ground rules and do the you know start this elected speaking, I did want to just say that you know welcome back everyone. I know for us. I hope some people were able to take a nice. You know break this summer and kind of just take a moment for yourselves. I know it's been a tough year. I just want to say how grateful I am for the office staff and we just have an amazing team and they've been tireless and they've, been on top of everything this whole summer and the board members as well. Again, we were on break for two months. We did have some meetings, but, like you guys are amazing and I just want to say how grateful I am you're. Just you know hard-working thoughtful and just really on top of everything, and as well as our elected officials and the city agencies, we have a great group on the east side of Manhattan, so our neighbors and our community leaders as well- and I hope some of those folks are on the call tonight, but I did want to just do a shout out to the people that are might be on the call that haven't been to a community board meeting before so you know sign up for the newsletter go. You know, check out our website on a monthly basis. It changes and you can be updated on the committee events, the committee meetings and you know we need more people to be involved and more people to volunteer. We need to work together, you know and volunteer participate. We just need to try to be a team on the east side. I think we're doing a great job and again we have so many amazing elected officials, really incredible hard working people with great ideas and I think we're a lot of us are on the you know, just working to make a better east side. But you know just we wanted this place to come alive again and to thrive. So I just want to put that out there before we start rolling, and hopefully we can just continue to keep working together to make this a better, a better east side. So and with that said, I feel like the ground rules, people kind of understand at this point a zoom call, so no one's can speak and hopefully just stay on mute if you can at all times until you want to speak for the board members you're allowed to unmute yourselves, but keep yourself muted, if you, if possible. So then we just don't have that background noise and we'll move through the committee business, but we have the chat function. You all know not to use that unless you know it's just a kind of a parliament. It's just a question: it's not the business of the board, so it might just be a technical question for the the staff, the office team and we'll and I'll identify you to speak again. You all yeah. I think, we've gone through this enough that we know this part, but the public is speaking and we've sent out notices, but we have some public folks asking to speak tonight, so I think they've mostly registered, I'm not sure I'll, keep an eye on my my feed here to see who's. I'm signed up and we'll go ahead and do that, but please sign up via the q, a feature on zoom to speak and we want your name affiliation and what topic you're going to speak about. So you know if you want to speak with them, we'll do that until 7 15 and then we'll close. That and we'll start. You know inviting people to speak after the next piece here, which is the elected official. So after with all that said, the next item on the agenda is to adopt tonight's agenda and I think do we have that on the screen. I don't have both my screens up, so I you've all been sent the agenda. So if I hear no objections, we'll go ahead and adopt the agenda for tonight, roll call and we'll do roll call after the adoption of the agenda. So okay, so the agenda has been adopted and we will move into roll call and that is cena's the shot. Oh you're, on mute, hi. Everyone do you think I would get it.

So you know, if you know, can keep it under five minutes. Three to five minutes. I don't know we're not going to time you, but if you everyone can kind of keep it keep it brief. That would be great, is jim trying to ask a question. Yes, I am yes, I am adoption of the minutes. Oh did I skip adoption of the minutes? Yes, I think you'd. I don't have the agenda in front of me, but I thought that that's usually next, after the adoption of the minutes, usually comes in the business session, which is happening all right. I'm sorry, no problem, no problem. So, let's start with councilmember ben kaylos good evening. If brendan or somebody can run the clock, I will follow the time limit, so I will be done before 7 17., I'm going to aim for 7 16 or 7 15., I'm council, member ben kalos, that's aunt ben kayla's on social media. We are all home. I can't speak for michael stinson's, but I can say that we are losing the fight on the 7pm bedtime. So my two and a half year old daughter, might jump in with a reason why she can't sleep. So I recommend turning down your volume and taking off headphones if possible. I hope everyone had a good labor day and I want to thank new yorkers who are working from home and in person during this pandemic, in particular city workers, who have kept our city running, and so I will always fight for you on this month we fought off the mayor's most recent threats of layoffs, and we continue to fight to restore 20 million dollars, cut from nonprofits, offering food, shelter and services to youth and seniors. If you wish to weigh in favor of our city workers, we I'd love it if you'd like to weigh in front of in favor of the nonprofits. I would love that too. As chair of the contracts committee, I've been reviewing contracts that can be cut or went wrong, and I found hundreds of billions of dollars in contracts for our nation's largest corporations for things like white papers, and I think we can cut the recent white paper on cyber security. That's worth several million dollars and that's just the tip of the iceberg. We also uncovered what was going on with the failure to deliver the air conditioning turns out the city had a huge fight with pc richards. I don't know what happened. I want to get to the bottom of it, but I'm not sure if pc richards is as reliable as they said, they would impression preparation for the school starting in september we spent most of the summer with our parents, principals, teachers and, most importantly, students and we bought to get their address concerned their concerns addressed and that got pushed out to the 21st. We had a hearing, sorry town hall last night, with deputy education department, chancellor department of education, deputy chancellor austin, who answered questions on test testing safety plans, remote learning. If you missed it, you can see it at facebook.com, benkaylo videos, I would just say if you have an education committee and you're interested I'd, recommend you do surveys, look up the surveys I pulled one school and all they had was windows and I've been in that school and I think they have one window per classroom that opens they didn't bother surveying the auditorium, and so, if you're interested I'm happy to partner with you, I'm making sure we have the support we need for the schools if there have been many concerns about homeless and public safety. We're here to help. We join the new york state nurses association, advocating for new york presbyterian to reopen its inpatient psychiatric services to help our mentally ill off the streets they serve about 600 folks, the most northern inpatient service currently is at 70th street. In my district there's nothing for upper Manhattan. We also have our east side task, force or homeless outreach and services. At this point, we're open to it's focused on cva, but we're open to helping out in cv6. We work with partners in the faith and nonprofit communities who are doing direct outreach, such as running soup, kitchens directly assist individuals, the most effective way to end our homeless crisis will be to build more affordable housing and supportive housing. We've built multiple buildings in my district, including across the street in my backyard, and the children from the supportive housing are now going to school at the school that my daughter is zoned for, as november creeps closer. We join activists throughout the nation to save the postal service and continue to battle a broken board of elections. They finally implemented a law I authored in 2016 for an absentee ballot tracker. You can find it at NYC absentee.com on the 14th, we'll be having our emergency preparedness and go back giveaway from six to seven. With distributions the following day. We also have our fresh food box. The key thing that I'm going to just deputize. All of you, too, is there, are still people who don't have PPE, who don't have sans hand sanitizer. We have tons of them. If you are willing to be a captain for your block for your building or even get a building service worker to hand it out to neighbors, we have it, we will give it to you we'll give you hundreds or thousands of masks, plus sand, tires to wrap up. We've all read the headlines that new york city is dying even dead, but nothing could be further from the truth, but the obituaries already written new york city finds itself in the same position as mark twain. Who once said, the reports of my death are greatly exaggerated. Please take a moment to read my piece on medium. I hope you'll join me in cheering for our city and all those who make it a best place in the world which, like those of you who are part of this community board and watching at home, and you can read all 41 articles in our newsletter at benkayles.com newsletter and we'll post everything on it is 7 17.. That is my time. You're amazing that rocks okay thanks ben yeah. We are, we are not dead, that's for sure, okay and, let's see who do we have next? I'm sorry I lost my oh is harvey on assembly member harvey epstein, that's who I have next to my list, I'm not sure. If harvey's, okay, we'll get back to harvey, I do see that our borough president gail brewer, has joined us and gail. Are you? Are you free to no I'm yep, I'm here there she is oh, hey, gail brewer! You have the floor. Welcome! Thank you very much here we go. Thank you very much. I'm sorry! Okay, congratulations to board six I'll, be very brief. A couple of things, certainly with the schools, we're very familiar with all the issues that the council member just listed. I will say that we as community boards. We know that we've had some meetings with the executive superintendent and I want to thank you and your and your colleagues for participating. We have to be very vigilant about the lack and obviously about those that are going to be doing blended and obviously what about persons who are going to be promote, so I know that your committees will be looking at that I'd love to hear back. It's not clear that everybody who wants to do blended learning will also the opportunity to be part of a learning lab. It will not be fully utilized in terms of numbers until the end of the year. So please keep us updated about that issue and I think all the issues there are some schools in your district that are not going to be open. There are quite a few in the bureau of Manhattan, because they're not up to code and perpetuation. I do want to say something else about the schools which is not dire, but I am looking for tutors. We are going to be circulating in our newsletter, which comes out every thursday how to get vetted by the new york city department of education, so that you can then be an assistant to those who are learning online or those who are using remote period. Jcc Manhattan some months ago had 200 members who were vetted already by the DOE, and they have been so conscientiously working with students. It has made a huge every principal is begging me for tutors. So I just want to say that's something that we're going to be asking your help on it's a commitment, but it's something that for those of us who are at home or who are looking to see what we can do pandemic, nothing could be more important than the education of our children. Second, the issue of police precinct barricades. It's not again something that's top of everyone's mind, but for those of us in the neighborhood we did put out a report showing that most of the precincts in the borough Manhattan have barricades for the street. We have heard from the police, commissioner, that they're reevaluating some of them have come down, but some of them are still up and I think that it doesn't send a good message to those of us who are trying to improve community police relations and I'll leave it at that. I know we're sick of the census, but let me tell you what we have been able to do. We talked to the new york city board of elections and we found out that 35 000 manhattanites, I'm sure plenty on board six move temporarily. Understandably, and they are now going to get a postcard from actually the league of women voters we're helping to pay for it, and it's going to say, please fill out the census. We know you've moved temporarily, do not use your temporary use, your permanent Manhattan home as an address refill it out if you have to second, in addition to that, we sent in the borough, Manhattan 140 000 postcards, maybe a month ago, and just recently, another 140 000 to those that are on the lowest performing census tracks, some of them board six, some of them in board five, some of them on board eight, and certainly some on board one in the financial district. You know what the issue is, that people have just moved and not filled it out so and then, finally, we were out on the streets. We did get some money from the governor, esd empire state development, very late, but we got it and we were the first borough, president of all five to get it out. It went to the bps not to the mayor to community groups that are working in harlem in the washington heights area. Korean community etc trying to make sure that they can work alongside complement the work, that's going on with those who are knocking on doors, we're also trying to work with again 32bj we're trying to get census. Workers declared essential workers because then they can be allowed into the buildings where many doormen understandably say you're, not an essential worker. You can't get in norman or a problem. So if you have some suggestions for that, let me know: post sites are a problem, we're trying to make sure that they are not schools, because I know all those issues either for the pre-voting or the voting day, and so we are trying to work with some of the cultural organizations to make sure that they could be post suggestions. I'm sure are welcome. I know that garbage is a problem. 65 of the weekday service was cut and 100 of the weekend, the litter baskets. So that's a big challenge, we're all out there cleaning. I don't know how many cleanups I've been on. I'm sure you have also, but the other one that was cut, was organics or composting depending on what you call it, and that was cut completely, so we're very upset about it, because people have learned to be. We need to save our composting, our organics, and it should not be going to the landfill. It should be stained for our composting community, so we have we're putting together a very major, solid waste advisory board group plus those are interested in this topic and helping us and brave some money and we're going to be looking at organics for the future, because it should be something that we do and it should be profitable can't make makes no sense that we have to get compost from delaware or something when we can be making sure it comes from new york. We also have learned. I don't know how this is going to work. The schools are going to be doing organics very strange. I am very always concerned about the dining I'm glad that there will be indoor dining. I hope it works. This mirror is going to have apparently 400 people doing some of the monitoring. We'll see if that works- and I think you know as much about it as I do. I continue to always be afraid of the future for the seniors and some group of people that we all care about we're trying to make sure that they get fed they're still nervous about coming out. We need times at the grocery stores to be continued when they can go for their time and not be joining everybody else. Thank you board. Six. Thank you gail. I really appreciate it. We have several of those items on in resolutions tonight so specifically around schools and the precincts closures street closures. We still have those both of our precincts still have barricades up and some pretty good. You know pretty good security stops there. So I appreciate it all right. I think that we have senator brad. Hoyleman is next to speak. If he is on the call senator hoyleman, oh there, he is hello. Hi see everyone good to see everyone. I hope everyone is healthy and had a good had a good weekend. I'm here with my with my colleague, sam vasquez, who's on everybody knows he's doing such a great job for us during this difficult time. I wanted to let you know about some legislation that I have with assembly member harvey epstein to help struggling small businesses. We know that small businesses are what's made. You know what makes our neighborhoods unique and they've been struggling mightily through this pandemic. That's why harvey- and I introduced this legislation that we hope will gain support in both houses it. It would provide new commercial rent relief and the obligation the rent obligation of covered tenants, Covid-19, 19, impacted small businesses and not-for-profits would be limited under this legislation to the lesser of 20 of their actual income in a given month or one-third of their contractual rent payments landlords have covered. Tenants would be required to waive 20 of the contractual rent and through this legislation the state would establish a commercial rent relief program consisting of money that we get from the federal government. We hope is still coming to provide financial assistance to impacted landlords to make up the difference. If we don't get the money from the federal government, you've probably been reading about the fact that a number of my colleagues, including me, have made a number of different proposals to tax the very higher echelons of new york state taxpayers to pay for these types of services and rental relief programs that are in such dire need. Right now, today, I testified at the state division of housing and community renewal on mcis the specifically the reasonable cost schedule for major capital improvements. I did it in collaboration again with assemblymember epsilon and council member keith powers and the sidetown peter cooper village, tennis association, as well as a number of other advocates. I called upon dhcr to delay the implementation of the cost schedule and make the third party report on which the schedule is based available to the public for review and discussion. There are a number of issues with the cost schedule is currently written, including excessive cost estimates for mcis the creation of loopholes that are going to allow owners to pass on even more of the expensive tenants and inclusion of items that shouldn't be considered in size at all. I'll. Be following up on that with my colleagues in dhcr to ensure that tenants are hurt on this important issue. Today, I was at a rally on the upper west side outside of the lucerne hotel that has been converted temporarily into a space for homeless during the covet 19 pandemic. I you probably know that the mayor has reversed course on some of his housing plans. Pandemic related housing plans for homeless, and you know I was there with assembly member linda rosenthal, the council member helen rosenthal of jumani williams. The borough president was there to decry this turn because it really, I think, sends a terrible message that if you just threaten a lawsuit against this city administration, on the issue of homelessness which is so fraught with, you know, specific community concerns and the city capitulates as they did in this instance. Well, it's going to be hard to locate a shelter, a residential program of this nature, even if it is temporary moving forward. At the end of the day, we certainly need more supportive housing. We're calling on that too. Both the state and the city have to step up in that regard, but we are approaching folks a humanitarian crisis as it pertains to homelessness, and we have to open our minds and our hearts to solve this problem, so I hope to be working on that more with you moving forward, along with my colleagues in albany and then we're continuing our fight for a fair election. In november, I joined a number of colleagues about a bill. I sponsor with assembly member dick godfrey that would allow the board of elections to create secure drop boxes throughout the state to collect ballots. The governor, just yesterday, has issued an executive order that requires local boards of elections to make plans that allow new yorkers to drop off ballots at some board of election and pull sites. But I really don't think this is enough. We need to go further to have these convenient drop boxes dispersed throughout the entire city and state, so everyone can vote this november. They, these are secure boxes. They look like mailboxes or fedex boxes. That would give voters a safe option to submit their absentee ballots outdoors without having to go inside and risk their health and vote early and not rely on the post office. 33 states, mali and the district of columbia have some sort of ballot drop box scheme to allow voters to go around the post office to cast their absentee or early ballots, and I believe it's time for europe to join that list, so we're going to continue to fight for that thanks. So much awesome, thank you and as a former oregonian, I dropped my ballot in the mail in the box 20 plus years ago, when you know living there. So there's it's ridiculous that it can't. It should be simpler, yeah, it's it! Hopefully, it'll take less than 20 years to catch up or yeah all right. Thank you all right! So we'll move on and I think, let's see we have katie loeb from council member carlina rivera's office katie's on the line. Hey everyone how's it going sorry about that. So thanks for having me, I hope everyone had a good summer and is getting ready for back to school, which has been pushed back until september. 21St carolina was very vocal with her colleagues in city council, including councilmember mark trager who's. Chair of the education committee, is calling for the delay in the start of school until all the buildings are safe, we're very glad to hear that it was pushed back and we're going to continue to monitor these buildings and their plans as they go forward. Any concerns feel free to bring them to me and our office will be following up with DOE regularly it's back to school unrelated in preparing our hospital system for a second surge in Covid-19 or at least to be prepared. Moving forward. Carlene has been very active as chair of the hospitals committee. In this she proposed 16 recommendations which I won't go over now, but she presented them at the state's joint committee hearing on hospital responses, and you can read that on the state's website or if you get our board report, there's a clickable link there and continuing the work at the city level. We have two hearings in september, one on the effects of copen 19 on our city's jails. We know there was a big outbreak in jails and so we're doing a joint hearing with council member keith powers, the and the criminal justice committee on september 21st and then we'll be doing a hearing on the test and trace program on september 25th with councilmember mark levine and the health committee, and as we work towards you know, we said indoor dining is opening up september. 30Th we'll be monitoring that, but we'll also be working on other things to help small businesses inc, including the personal liability protections currently passed. A bill and city council passed a bill about preventing landlords from coming after the personal liability of small business owners and commercial leases and we're hearing an extension of that bill and we're very hopeful that will be passed and just codify that protection for small business owners and september is also the last month for the census. Probably there are some questions there, but probably the last month. It's very important. We fill it out so we're doing you know everything we can to get people to fill out the census and we're holding an event this saturday september 12th at 12 p.m, at the two fifths, houses 444 second avenue and 3 30 east 26th street. So I hope we'll see you guys there and thank you so much great thanks, katie and I do see some representatives have their hands raised. I know you're on the call, so I kind of just have a little list here. I'm trying to go in order. So I don't know if you have questions, but if you don't have a question, I know I got you and I'll call on you as we as we go down the list here. Okay, thanks guys, all right, so ben jacobs from council member keith powers office is on the line yeah. Why is he hey ben my bike? Isn't working? Can you can you hear me right? Good, awesome? Sorry, okay, hey! I was going to go into a whole thing about how it's been six months since I've been in Manhattan and I've been stuck in my one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn, but you have a clock running, so I will skip all that as well as a number of things. The folks who spoke ahead of me mentioned, which are which are a bit repetitive to what we have, but I wanted to mention the council member powers. You know proposed the small business recovery leaks program with a couple of his colleagues in albany and councilman brad lander in Brooklyn, which would allow for commercial leases for businesses essentially to renegotiate their leases with their landlords to get them reduced and the landlords will get a property tax break for a period as a way to compensate for that, because that's the one of the real obstacles here just want to touch on. I know we've heard about new yorkers experiencing homelessness and everything happening there and, of course, you're. Probably all aware of the everything happening with the vanderbilt y, I know, councilman powers has been we've set up meetings with the middle y and department of homeland services, friends of dead camera school, plaza, the turtle bay association just trying to keep the lines of communication as open there as possible and make it as transparent as possible and make the whole situation work as well as possible because being a good neighbor goes both ways, and it's really important that the community is is welcoming and that site is successful because our right to shelter law is just so pivotal and we don't. We don't celebrate it enough. I think we've already touched on the everything going on with the 13th and 17th precinct, with the blocks being closed off, want to thank you guys for your leadership on that. As a community board, we've been in touch with city hall, I'm not going to stop emailing them until we get an actual response on that and on the on the election. I just wanted to know that you know for everything everyone says about the board of elections. We've heard a lot of complaints about where poll sites are and how full sites were configured in our district. Even going back to his campaign in 2017, we've spent the better part of the last couple years, working with the board of elections. We've sat down, we've gone out to sites I've gone out there and measured with their fancy, laser measuring things and the distance, and all that we've got new poll sites open in cb6 at the ford foundation at the vanderbilt y, the stuyvesant town community center is a poll set again so that everyone inside town can vote inside town, the brookdale campus. I know that's not the best early voting site for everyone in cb6, but it's open now, so we were very happy to help with that want to do more. On that going forward the composting we all we've all heard about we're going to be we're working with the liberty psychology center to opening open a community composting site in stuyvesant town. So more on that soon. But keith wanted me to thank the service down peter cooper village, tennis association for their for bringing that to his attention and making that work more details on that soon and my time is on, but everyone should get a flu shot. Thank you, oh, that was impressive ben and that was a fun little beep. I hadn't heard that beat before it's a little annoying, but it's kind of fun. Thank you yeah. So we have a rebecca grigas from assembly member dan quartz office, hi, molly, hi, everybody, it's rebecca hi from assembly member dan court's office. I hope everyone enjoyed their summer. I have a few things to touch upon in my report. First, as mentioned previously, the board of elections has created a absentee ballot track game system, which you can easily go on the boat.nyc website to find out more about how you can track your absentee ballot. Once you request it, we think it may be because of the assembly members legislation to establish an absentee ballot tracking system that I mentioned in our last meetings report. So we want to say it was because of that. But you know we don't want to clean credit, but we're very glad that this development came about. Secondly, one of the assembly members bills has gained traction and national news coverage, which is his bill on geolocation tracking news outlets such as wyatt associated press and more have done pieces about the assembly members bill. That would prevent law enforcement agencies from obtaining geofence warrants to search people, cellular data based off of their location near a potential crime scene. You can visit the assembly members twitter page to find all of those articles, they're very informative pieces, it's a hot new topic. So, if you're interested, please feel free to go and take a look at those and we are still assisting folks with unemployment, helping them to connect with tenant resources and a lot more. So if you need help with anything, please give us a call or send an email, and we will do our best to help you out, and that is all for my report. Thanks great thanks, rebecca and next we have taylor from representative carolyn maloney's office, hello, good evening, everybody, I hope you're all doing well had a good summer. The congresswoman has had a very busy summer with the biggest focus being saving the postal service and ensuring a complete and accurate count on the census. The census ends september 30th, which you can fill out if you haven't yet at my20census.gov, and we've been working on that there is a oversight hearing this week, another one on the census tomorrow, she will also be hosting a round table on her pandemic risk insurance act. The oversight committee will also be, or has also opened, an investigation into the deaths at fort hood. Last week at following her august 24th oversight, hearing the congresswoman subpoenaed postmaster general dejoy for the documents she asked him to produce we're waiting on some of those still we've gotten some. She also authored a bill. The delivering for America act to protect the u.s postal service that passed the house an emergency session on august 22nd. Following that here, the hearing she also introduced the nonpartisan postmaster general act. She also joined a group of other committee chairs, asked the department of defense inspector general to launch an investigation based on a new complaint, alleging a campaign of retaliation against vin vinman. Lieutenant colonel's vinman. She also requested the department of homeland security inspector general reviewed, the legality of actions taken by chad wolfe. As acting secretary of homeland security and ken cuccinelli. As the senior official performing the duties of deputy secretary, she also released a memo updating oversight committee members on the status of the committee's investigations related to the subpoena of the president's accounting firm, there's, also a lot of other things that were done in the past few months, which can be found on our website at maloney.house.gov on the oversight website at oversight.house.gov by subscribing to our newsletter. There's also going to be a lot more to hear about after this month's session happens that just started this week. So thank you. If you have any questions, I will put my email in the chat for anyone who doesn't have it yet great thanks, taylor yeah very busy a lot going on. Okay and next we have greece pair from assembly member gottfried's office. Yes, thank you very much. I hope everyone had a great summer. Senator hoyleman talked a little bit about the dropbox voting bill, and so in the interest of brevity I will just skip over that, but somebody remember godfrey is, of course a sponsor in the assembly of that bill regarding the kovid pandemic, as any public health authority would confirm to feeding the virus is going to depend on testing and contact tracing, but that is not going to work unless all the people are confident that the information that they give to contact tracers is not going to be used against them by immigration authorities or provided to entities like insurance companies or marketing firms. Therefore, somebody member gottfried introduced a bill to protect the confidentiality of conflict contact tracing for covid19, along with new york state senate health committee, chair gustavo rivera it passed both houses of the legislature in july and is awaiting the governor's signature even before covent 19 new york had the biggest income inequality of any state and we urgently needed major increased public investment in healthcare, public education from pre-k through higher education, housing, mass transit, a lot of other fundamental services. Those needs are even more pressing now. Somebody remember godfrey believes they could best be met by raising new revenues through taxes on high wealth that wouldn't affect the overwhelming majority of new yorkers. That's why he's joined with nearly 100 colleagues in the legislature, labor unions, the fiscal policy institute and activists in the strong economy for all coalition to call for a balanced state tax policy where everyone pays their fair share. Just today, a poll came out conducted by heart research that showed that an overwhelming majority of new yorkers favor increased taxes on people earning over a million dollars a year and also on people earning over five hundred thousand dollars a year. He also this summer joined with senator alessandro biaggi to introduce the budget equity act. It would amend the new york state constitution to ensure the legislature plays an equal role with the governor in shaping the state budget. It's currently interpreted in many judicial rulings. The new york state constitution gives any governor enormous sway over the budget process. The executive branch therefore has a disproportionate control over the final budget process. It creates a strong imbalance between the two branches which are supposed to be co-equal, and he has introduced legislation to pass a constitutional amendment in new york state. As chair of the assembly health committee, he convened a hearing last month on Covid-19 a devastating toll in nursing homes around the state focused a lot of public attention on the crisis that happened during the pandemic, but it's something that assembly member godfrey has been focused on for many years. He believes that the state has long kind of neglected nursing before 19, like inadequate staffing, just trying to focus pressure on the larger problems. I guess I will stop there. Thank you very much great. Thank you. Breese and we've been joined by assemblymember harvey epstein. If harvey is on screen, I'm here, molly hi, hello. How are you so? Should I start? Yes, please. I just want to wish everyone a happy labor day and welcome back to our september. I'm not sure what it's going to be this year september, but we are here, and so the things that are kind of pressing to everyone knows about is one is you know, we've heard. What's been going on around the post office in the slowdown, I organized a rally along with senator hoyleman and councilwoman rivera as well as distributed. Plastico just really pushed him. The issue off the 14th street post office. There were rallies all over the country, we're proud to have our own local rally. You know everyone recognizes our small businesses, which is really the heart of the city, are all in crisis every day, places that we all know and love are just closing, and so I introduced a bill which is really the rent relief bill for small businesses. The people want to know it's 810 901, along with senator hoyleman, and the bill really focuses on rent relief for small businesses. We in july, as bruce mentioned, we were in session and we did some work and one of the things we did actually in june was friendly for residential tenants, but we did nothing for our commercial tenants and if we want to keep the 29 000 restaurants, the tens of thousands of small businesses, the local card store the nail salon in the yarn store, either bodega we're going to need real rent relief. So that bill really is a critical piece of legislation that we've been pushing, along with coalitions from all over the city in the state and hope is that we can get enough traction on that today. Earlier today the dhcr had a hearing on proposed. I hope they were regulations, but they really weren't. They were just documents where they were going to look at. What's reasonable customary charges for people who are unstabilized, what we passed in 2019 limited, the major capital improvements, two percent of the cost, two percent of the mci to add on to a rent a year. Also, we had a reasonable new standard in that in legislation. Hcr basically threw all those ideas out the window today with their with their hearing and their proposal and allowed a huge waiver process. That's going to help all property owners and not tenants, really is in violation of what we passed in legislation, misguided attempt by hcr and something that we're trying to us and other advocates are really fighting for, and I know my colleagues are with me on this. We also had a hearing lots of hearings, as mentioned that someone gottfried had we had hearing yesterday, yesterday's on people with disabilities and the struggles that people with disabilities are having through the Covid-19 epidemic, and we know how much covet has really impacted communities of color, but people with disabilities, as you know, with a only with a 70 unemployment rate prior to Covid-19 they're really getting hit, and so we really need to focus on how we support the disability community, both in education, employment and other opportunities and finally, actually just two more things. One are on school, real things. Everyone knows where we're at. I just still be troubled that we're not ready, and my kids and everyone's kids are potentially going back to school on the 21st and what we're hearing from the teachers is. You know we are not ready and there isn't enough revenue and the schools need to be safe places, and I have some deep concerns. There's a rally starting outside my office tomorrow at 3 pm. If anyone will come to 7th street avenue b and join us and raise real red flags about whether we're ready to reopen our schools and then census, as everyone knows, we have just took the end of this month to fill up the census of having done it. I encourage everyone to do it. We need to fill out the census and the last thing will be just on revenue and bruce mentioned this effort that I still remember gottfried and I are leading around the budget justice coalition, and we had 105 members signed onto a letter to the leadership saying to the governor and the this assembly speaker and a majority member of the senate, saying we need revenue, not cuts. Now we need to get back into albany and pass those bills. We can't wait any longer with a 5 billion dollar cut in education, two billion for our schools means nine thousand teachers get laid off. You see twenty two thousand workers in the city getting laid off it is. We need revenue now we need money from the federal government. There's no question, but the state has real opportunities for revenue, whether it's on high income earners against private equity companies, a pa to terror, attack, there's so many sources of revenue that are available for us and that we need to do it. So what I ask you all to do is get involved. We need people to call the governor push him today. He talked about maybe new revenue on high income earners. We got to keep pushing him because we need revenue, if not everything we care about and everything we love in. The city can fall apart, because the cuts will be draconian and it will mean a real difficult time for the city. Unfortunately, for decades to come so be with me, focus on real revenue. We need to fight for revenue, not cuts, and I am happy that you are all hopefully doing well and safe in this september. Well, you too harvey thank you so much thanks for that. All right. Sorry, I lost so it's madeline for senator krueger's office madeline's on the call hi cv6, it's good to be back with you. This is madeline from senator kruger's office.

Thank you up. Next is michael stinson from comptroller scott stranger's office and his beautiful baby. I hope yeah well he's in the background making noise so happy good time, good to see everybody. I hope. Well, everybody else wish you a happy summer so I'll do it as well. So hope you all had a great summer, just two quick things all mentioned. I think it was about two weeks ago now, at this point, even though every day has been the same, the comptroller, as well as congressman adriano espaiot, sent a joint letter to the city department of sanitation and the department of health and mental hygiene calling on the city to take immediate steps to address the overflowing water baskets and increase rat sightings along the city's commercial corridors, citing dozens of complaints from business owners across the city congressman and the comptroller underscored that the mounds of garbage are both unsightly and unsanitary driving away customers at a time when struggling small businesses are relying on foot traffic for survival and attracting rats and vermin which spread disease. While our city is in the midst of a deadly pandemic, congressman especially comptroller stringer proposed recommendations to remedy the untenable piles of trash accumulating in our city, streets, sidewalks and public spaces, including working with business improvement, districts and business owners to provide flexibility to businesses that want to add street bins at their own expense and broadening the clean curbs pilot program. I'll. Send you the full letter, it's also available on our comptroller website, that's controller.misc.gov and then one other thing. Just last week the comptroller proposed a first of its kind bike to school plan to encourage safe and sustainable biking options for new york city high school students on their commutes to and from school. The controllers plan called on the city in partnership with the philanthropic community, to build out one and a half miles each of protected bike lanes around 50 new york city high school buildings in the next year and to provide free bicycles or city bike memberships to every low-income public high school students with reductions in bus and subway service, school buses operating in extremely limited capacity in the computer and the continued need for social distancing on public transit. The comptroller's bike school proposal offers a safe and efficient transportation option for new york city's young people I'll leave it at that I'll. Send these links to you guys and I'll. That's it I'll look forward to seeing you next month, thanks michael yeah, your son likes those ideas, he's excited about that. No he likes to make his voice heard here. Thank you for bringing him and sharing you with us all right. So I think our last elected official is philip ellison from public advocate jumani williams. Yeah. Thank you, I'm glad to be here, as we start up again, and so just a few updates around the you know, feelings and the policy and legislation coming out. The public advocates office from germany williams. So you know recently, the public advocate in our office actually has been heavily involved in the school reopening fight, so to speak, partly pushing and reimagining how we should open schools and disagreeing with the mayor and laying out a plan in july, as well as supporting the you know, teachers and calling out the mayor when, in regards to the lack of preparedness, so part of that led to being a vocal critic on this reopening plan and really calling for there to be a delay until october, based upon the safety standards and the infrastructure needs being met. Right then, allowing a phased reopening to begin with elementary school students and and older students returning in 2021. So we've really tried to position that listening to science like let's be safe and cautious and actually push back for some of that and we're seeing you know some of the infrastructure issues remain in these days that make us really cautious this time. So that's one of the elements that the public advocates really pushing on the other is recently city council passed legislation, a co-sponsorship between bonnie williams and carlos menchaca, as we as we reopen and construction now is starting up again that the training deadlines be pushed until march. We think that the safety that folks have access and people really construction workers need to be thought about, as we've been thinking about essential workers throughout this pandemic that you know, construction workers have access and time to really realign with the safety measures that need to be as we reopened so that was passed recently in the city council and the public advocate was a co-sponsor and when we think about the school reopening and just dealing with the issues of schools, we our office and the public advocate introduced two. We think really key legislation to be considered by the city council. Intro 2058 understanding that the digital divide and even kind of punitive measures happening in our city in regards to remote learning and understanding the you used to need of data, we announced the legislation with mark traeger. This is the council chair on education to for the department of education to report weekly on remote learning, attendance right, that reporting be disaggregated by school grade, race, individualized, education, plan status and other factors. We really use the data to target where we need the support to go to students and families, not just punish or not just continue on, as families are falling behind during this era of remote learning. So that's really important and the last thing on this piece is thinking about if we have a second wave, if there's another pandemic or emergency, that happens, that DOE develop a plan for food and that be really thoughtful around food access for everyone, lunch breakfast and have a plan for that not just be prepared and so those elements. Lastly, I launched an update email from Manhattan that I send out to the community board, so I hope you all have access to that to understand what we're you know, what he's saying, what we're doing and what we're thinking about and any events that we have. Thank you for your time and you all have a wonderful night. Excellent. Thank you, phillip, good stuff, all right so now we'll move into. We have some. I think some members of the public that like to speak jesus, do you have the you have the list, so I just want to say I'm not sure how many folks we have wanting to speak, but, okay, so four people, but we do have the timer. So it's a three minutes, but I did want to say it and then it's not an abundance of people, but you know if you are, if it's the same topic as someone else has, you know discussed you might want to just say. I agree if that, if it's indeed you know all in agreement and some a similar topic in a similar, you know in support of or opposed to type of thing. So jesus can do you want to announce the names and sure I can do that. Okay, all right. Our first speaker is pete harrison, he's a district resident and lives at stytown and he wants to speak in support of density reduction, hotel sites for the homeless. Pete. Take it away! Oh there. Can you hear me? Yes, hey everybody. I hope you had a good summer. I am here to speak briefly. I guess in favor of housing, the homeless, in hotels during covet 19.. I do look forward to the committee meeting on september 21st to speak in more detail about this issue and the short-term solutions and long-term solutions. But the point tonight just quickly is we are obviously hearing a lot about the homeless. I think we're going to hear some more after I speak, but we're not hearing anything from the homeless and I think that matters a lot. So I'm going to take the opportunity to speak up for them to the extent that I can so before coved started, there were already over 60 000 homeless, new yorkers, that's a record. The vast majority of them are women and children. Now, when covet hit, the guidelines were to stay at home, but obviously these individuals cannot stay at home. They don't have homes and the shelter systems that the vast majority of them are in are crowded and just petries for expanding the cove. We talked about it in jail's, one of the other employees mentioned the jail breakout here. The stakes are real. Here. Reports are saying that 79 are a homeless individual has a 79 percent higher chance to die of covid19 in a shelter system and outside of the shelter system. Obviously we have a current population of about 10, 000, homeless individuals that were part of the mayor's program to house the homeless in hotels. That is not a great solution either. In many cases they're doubled up, the CDC has very clear outlines. The best procedure is to have an individual at an individual room, so we're not even near the recommended public outreach for what is required to protect these individuals and protect the public. Health fema is reimbursing all of this, so this is not something a city is going out of pocket for or obviously in a fiscal crisis already. So this from a basic common sense, understanding of public health, every new yorker has a right to safety. Every new yorker has a responsibility to protect each other, and this is a case where that is not happening when our neighbors are resisting the implementation of these hotels, I understand their anecdotes about homeless individuals. These are the same kind of fear-mongering that were used to shut down sros to shut down these types of supporting housing services in the good times before kovid. So, in a matter of good common sense, public health, we must protect these individuals. We must find these short-term solutions to house individuals and families to provide services, and then the long term, which I hope to talk about more on the 21st- is a agenda for housing for all and more social housing, more funding. It takes city, state and obviously federal leadership, but thank you so much. Thank you. Pete all right, jesus all right. The next speaker is p wong. Who is a resident of this district and lives in kipps bay? They want to speak against density reduction, hotel sites for the homeless. I will p wong. I will enable your microphone just give me one. Second, all right there you go. Can you hear me? Yes, okay, great? So yes, I'm here to talk about how I am against the homeless hotels, but before I go into that, I wanted to provide some context for the neighborhood that I'm in I'm in kipp's bay and kipps bay is home to hra men's shelter, which is the largest men's shelter with 850 beds and main champs drop-in center and the aca s youth center. So, before the homeless, hotels even came into our neighborhood, we had a population that included former felons and, at this time, 47 registered sex offenders and of those sex offenders. The sex offender parolees that are living within 1 000 feet of the churchill school that is actually currently a violation of new york law. So that's the context of the neighborhood before the homeless shelters came into place. So then in 2020 we have in a span of six blocks, five homeless hotels that brings about 700 rooms. Now, whether that's a single or double occupancy room that is bringing now 700 to up to 1400 additional people in a six in a span of six blocks from 25th street to 31st street. So if you put hra with these homeless hotels, we have 2 250, homeless people, mostly men in this span of six blocks, which is putting an undue burden on our neighborhood of kipp's bay and of those residents in the hotels. Some of them are former Rikers prisoners, and statistics show that 200 2 500 prisoners that were released, 10 percent are rearrested 450 times. That means one prisoner is arrested more than once. So what does that mean for our neighborhood? That means we have an increase in crime and a decrease in a quality of life. How so open drug use, urinating defecating on the streets, increased crime such as robberies and assaults drunken and aggressive, behavior, menacing loitering and panhandling, and, like I said in a span of six blocks, it's just an undue burden and puts our youth, our children and our elderly at risk, and I'm not the only one who feels this way. There's a community consensus of nearly 1200 residents signing a petition that we're also against housing the homeless in the hotels, but I am, I am all for alternatives, so if jacob javits can be used as a Covid-19 hospital, I believe jacob javits is a viable alternative for housing the homeless, but right now our neighborhood of kids bay is really heavily residential and very small, whereas jacob javits is really set up for this kind of thing, and even though it wasn't maximized to its benefit for as a kobe 19 hospital, I think it will work as housing the homeless. Thank you for listening all right. Thank you, asus all right. The next speaker is evan roughhart, who is a member and administrator of the group? Third and 33rd all right. I've enabled your mic all right. Can you hear me? Yes? Okay? So briefly, I do agree with the last speaker and a little back a little bit of background. I grew up in this neighborhood in the 60s and 70s I went to ps, 116 junior high school 104.. I'm now raising my three of my children. Here. One has just started at baruch and the other two go to school in the future, and this is really my concern is specifically focusing on housing of the Rikers and possibly other prisoners. Who've been released from state prisons who were homeless once they were released and they're placed in certain hotels. The state is, and the city are both not identifying where these particular ex-cons or con. You know people on probation are they're not responding to responding negatively to foil requests. So my real concern, or what I really want to voice- is safety and safety for those who, like my children, older people who are facing certain risks from this population and very specific to like where we live. Local deli owners have confided in me that individuals associated living in some of these hotels have come in to their stores shown weapons gotten into like a lot of fights and things. Although it doesn't seem that they are really doing criminal activity in our neighborhood right now, they are certainly detracting from the quality of life they're sitting on and blocking entrances to buildings, creating quite a negative, a negative impact. So that's just something to consider and certainly, like the last speaker said, open to solutions, but my larger concern is to have some accounting from the city and or state as to who is actually living in these hotels and maybe not by name but just how many people are there and what kind of crimes have they been convicted of all right, thanks very much for listening and have a good night great thanks, evan, there's one more yes, alexandra, sasha nester chuck. She did not give her affiliation, so miss nestor chuck if you can state your affiliation when you start speaking, we'd appreciate that I'll enable your mic. Now, yes hi. How are you? My name is alexandre misterchuk. I am with math counsel and housing, though I will speak on my own on my own term, because I am resident of upper west side for 12 years. It's been the nicest quietest neighborhood until we've got a lot of new homeless that have been injected into our neighborhood and obviously defecation and urinating, and everything that I have to agree with miss won. It's exactly the same thing happening on upper west side, women and children are scared to go outside as well as elderly, because people homeless people as much as we care about their safety as well, and them as people need to be. This issue needs to be addressed by our mayor, our government, our country, because I I'm just really curious why people and who decide to put men that have been pedophiles registered, pedophiles and drug addicts into residential neighborhood, where children and elderly are affected, as well as instead of women and children, as I would, for example, choose to do, but also you know it's an issue. It's a higher issue than anything else, because homeless should be attend to and maybe build facilities for them because a lot of them. It's a mental issue, homelessness right, so there's a lot of people with mental illnesses and they should be addressed, and maybe there would be you know, a building of sanatoriums for them. You know outside of the city, in a normal environment, with medication, instead of imposing them on safety of new york city people. Well, that's all I wanted to say thank you thanks alexandra all right hold for one minute, I'm so sorry, okay, so we are, I think, moving out of public session is that jesus is that all we have. I do believe he said. Okay, so we'll move into the business session, and we have the june 10th full board meetings that were distributed earlier to the board. So I'd like to adopt those media minutes. If there are no objections and say well, andrew has his hand raised. I don't know andrew I'm sorry was that for oh near me, yeah, oh no. I have my hand raised about the just about the comment section if I could say something, but if not don't want to interrupt the process, the chat or in the comment, the comments before just in the open comments a moment ago. It means the public session in the open session you know. Can we can we speak to that element with housing? We have all those issues coming with our next, I'm not even sure what the date is, but our next for that committee report. I think we'll will address a lot of those issues so and can we let's adopt the minutes and then we can go back to I see jim and someone else might have their hand raised so jim are you I want to adopt the minutes of the june full board you're on mute, oh he's, on mute, sorry, this is on the minutes. Okay, I had sent a note and I just wanted to make sure that the my vote on, I think it was resolutions 5a and 5b were- was recorded as a no reasons I explained in the email. We got that going. Okay, so it's been changed. The vote's been changed. Yes, they don't. Okay, thank you. It was thank you appreciate it. Thank you all right. So seeing no other questions or objections. The minutes are adopted and my chairs report, I was actually going to honor one of our past members. Who's moved away, but he was unavailable tonight so we'll I was hoping to do it in person anyway. Maybe in several months we could do some of these things in person. So I am going to waive my report except to say that I hear that it's sandy mckee's birthday today so happy birthday, sandy yay and that's all jesus district managers report, hello, everyone I'll be super quick, since we have a lot of to get through tonight, I'll just touch upon a couple of housekeeping items. Cb6 members, as you all know, every wednesday the cb6 office sends you an email with helpful updates, fittingly called the wednesday email. Today's edition, you may have noticed, looked a little different because we're using the platform that we use for our newsletter instead of just a plain old email. That means that the email might be waiting for you in your spam or mass mail folder so be sure to look for it there. If you don't see it in your inbox and to set a filter. So it goes into your inbox directly changing gears. A few weeks ago, we sent every cd6 member an email regarding the cd, the city's identifying information law which restricts, which restricts how we can share the personally identifying information that we collect. Like your information, the email contained a form that asked every member to select what information they are comfortable with us sharing. If you haven't filled out that form. Yet please do so, as we will begin reaching out to members who have not submitted their forms. All right, that's it for me. That concludes my report. Great thanks, jesus brian van neuvenhoven, treasurer's report good evening. Everybody I'm gonna, try to make this quick. This is our first report for fiscal year 2021. We got a report from omb on september 1st and it reflects these numbers, our personal services budget for the upcoming years, 228 321, with a balance of 197 190 with 31 130 spent or obligating our current budget for other than personal services. Excluding rent is 140 659.. This figure contains a hundred and ten thousand one. Eighty five of our retained street fare money and our remaining otps budget is thirty thousand four. Seventy four for the year. We have not spent any of this budgeted money yet. Finally, similar to last year, we have a rent budget of 162 935. We have set aside all this money for a transaction to pay rent obligations for the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends on june 30th 2021. Once again, when this is paid, we will have met our obligations and we will not have monthly reports of expenditures in that category. Does anyone have any questions? No, thank you thanks, brian all right and then, since we have the honor of having borough president gayle brewer with us tonight, we'll skip brian lafferty's report. Since we got a great report from gail and moving to committee reports and resolutions, let's see who do we have starting? Oh, and this is we're doing the elections committee initially, so I will step aside and let jesus or rick just start this portion and don't mute myself, I'm pre-muted myself! So can you mute yourself, and I just give this a few moments? Is there someone else from the committee that just having rick is there someone else from the committee? I maybe he knew he's having a little bit of typical. Can we have someone else lead this or I know the committee is here tonight, so maybe there's someone else that can read the oh? No, I got it now. Oh there you are okay. Thank you, jesus! No, you know, I you know, give me the microphone I'll talk for the rest of the evening. He, the elections committee met twice.

Otherwise, you'll be given time at the october meeting before the board to make a statement. If you choose guess what mommy's going back to work tomorrow, that's not me. Okay. That concludes the report of the elections committee. Okay, thank you, rick all right, so I'll we're not voting on anything for a few committees here. So let's just keep moving and then I'll kind of go through the voting process. When we get to the resolutions kavitha matthew, chair of 197a working group, avita yeah, I I'm going to waive my report for tonight. Okay, thank you and then we're back to rick for budget and governmental. I told you, I'm gonna talk the rest of the evening. The at first I want to thank our outgoing chair, brian van newenhoven, and announced that reshna patel will be the vice chair for budget and governmental affairs. We're going to have our next meeting on monday, at which time we're going to be talking about the top budget, requests that we'll be making. This will be our last opportunity to talk about it. Anyone is welcome to attend. The meeting is monday, the 14th, and that's it. If you have any questions you can contact me or the board office very important this year. I know we have a lot of challenges all right, so corinne vanderdonk, chair, housing, homeless and human rights molly, just really quick to let everyone thank you for any for the people that spoke during the public session about the housing of people in our temporary housing of people in our hotels in our district, we will be having a meeting on september 21st, where the only thing we will be discussing is exactly that. It will start with an update on the current conditions, followed by a panel discussion around new ideas to solve this old problem we will be talking about. There will be people talking about supportive housing, affordable housing, outreach people will be talking about their experiences and we hope that you will all attend. Thank you. I think let look andrew do you want to speak now, and then we have brian, with his hand, raised as well. No thanks molly. I just simply just wanted to say the comments that, as a member of that committee to those people who spoke, I really hear them and I hear how concerned they are and I join those deep concerns, and I just want people to know who are feeling a sense of fear that they're that I'm, that I'm listening and the committee is listening quite seriously and that we plan to take action yeah. Thank you, brian yeah. Thank you. I had listened to some of the comments that were shared earlier tonight and some of the concerns revolve around you know possibly sanitation issues. You know issues about a personal space between people on the street because you know we live in a crowded city and it's really hard when someone has a home base in a neighborhood and is also taking up space on a sidewalk and they're interacting with other people and people feel uncomfortable, and I understand that might get aired out and it's something that we can work out. Possibly as a neighborly basis, I just want to mention that I saw some of the people mention that there was some perception of bringing additional risk of local residents by living near homeless people or homeless facilities. I one of the speakers mentioned potential pedophiles in those buildings mentioned potential ex-convicts in those buildings just to clarify there isn't a notification system that we use in the city of new york to let you know when you've moved down the street from a convicted felon, so a convicted felon can move into a town house anywhere in this city and be down the street from you, and you will not know it, because that is not an obligation. There's no such law pertaining to that. Applying that exact same standard to the homeless population. It offends me, but it's also completely not a legal concern, and I think that we need as a community, to talk our way through that with our neighbors to let them know where certain public safety issues are good grounds for us to discuss and try to work through and where certain other stuff really crosses the line and adds too much of an unfair burden to that population. The homeless people who are sheltered in our community they're our neighbors. They live here. They're citizens, end of story thanks brian and we're working with. You know dhs the outreach teams, brc breaking ground and so on, and you know the 13th and 17th precinct. We're really trying to have all you know everyone talking and really trying to find solutions together and help. Folks that are on the street are in the shelters and you know don't have a lot of open space to go during the day. So we'll have this whole discussion on the 21st. I really look forward to it. Oh corinne. Let's we should move the agenda, but corinne and jim and then okay go ahead. Karen, oh and yusuf corrine, jim and yousef, and then let's you can move. Thank you molly. I just you know just in case you can't make it on september 21st. We do ask people to try to find constructive solutions and to volunteer and help out, and so one of the things is that we would. We are working on having a book drive for the to so that people can drop off books and puzzles and board games at the vanderbilt y for our new neighbors and when it comes to people having to use the restroom. This is a real issue. This is a real problem. There are no public restrooms available right now. This is a problem that isn't going to go away unless we actually start providing public restrooms. So if you as a community organization as a as a block, can find a church can find a synagogue can find a willing facility in your neighborhood that is able to open up their restrooms for our people that are experiencing homelessness. That would be a great help. Jim yeah, just speaking to the point about the homeless, not being any different from in the homeless, in the shelter being any different from homeless residing in a in a brownstone or whatever. I think the issue here is really a matter for the state legislature and my view is that if someone is paroled and they do not have their own residence of a neighborhood of a neighbor, I'm sorry other relative or a friend, someone that will take them in then we shouldn't probably be giving them parole. We do it, and this applies to violent felony offenders, particularly repeat offenders. If they're going to be released into the public, then either the state should provide a halfway house for at least six months, perhaps a year. Okay, these people have not finished their terms. By and large I mean, if they have, they have that's a different condition. But if the parole board is giving people parole, then there should be some means for them to be housed in a hot in a facility that is not in a residential location. Javits center fine someplace, like that fine, but you can't house these people in a residential neighborhood. We had a rape. Five years ago we had a murder in the shelter itself. We had. We had a gentleman who ran a tailor shop up in. I think it was 27th street who was who was stabbed and robbed by all three of these were shelter incidents, people who either lived in the shelter or events that occurred in the shelter all of them had prior violent felony offenders, felony arrests, the state is not putting people from our neighborhood here. A lot of these guys are coming in out of albany out of buffalo. Out of you know the rural communities in western new york, where I grew up, that's where all this new york city is basically seen as a dumping ground for the prisons, and we have to stop that and we have to start objecting to it. Otherwise, you know when I look at the east side, particularly the upper east side, where the donors live, the political donors, I'm aware of only one shelter up there, it's at the 79th street armory and it is specifically designated for women aged 45 and older. So no men and I think we need to stop accepting the fact that oh we'll take everybody. We can't and we shouldn't that's all thanks jim yusuf and then we'll move the agenda. That's yeah, I'm actually wearing my hope, t-shirt, which is a part of the dhs annual account of the homeless in the city, and I recommend I don't know how it'll work this year, but I recommend that folks get involved because you learn a lot about the street homeless and the barriers to getting into shelters similar to what's been mentioned before. I want to thank folks for speaking up and speaking openly and plainly, I think better to do that than not. I would just say that I found that one of the benefits of this community is that, in fact, we do have a shelter here and the largest facility housing, the homeless in the city, because I think it allows us to understand the challenges associated with that, but it also allows us to, I think, more intimately understand the challenges associated with being homeless. So to karen's point earlier, you know. Where do you go to the bathroom right? How do you find a place to to seek shelter these basic things that we take for granted, and so I think this community is actually in a very strong place over the next weeks and months and with the amazing event, that's going to happen in a couple weeks to actually lead the city in discussions about this and to uphold the dignity of our homeless neighbors, because we are again a generous district that is welcome and homeless in this district. So that's all to say that I'm excited about what's being organized by the committee and again thank the folks who've, who have spoken thus far great thanks, joseph all, right so we'll move to sorry. I lost my place here to john keller, and this is, I think, is it sandy mckee for transportation. There is a joint health and education transportation committee resolution. So, as we begin to vote on all these resolutions tonight, we have several. I know we've all done this once or twice before, but we have the digital ballot and it's pretty turnkey. I hope you all can see it's in the click on the link in the chat, and I think we have solution for charles or sema will ask charles who's just here tonight by phone to for his vote for things at the end of the meeting, but go ahead and as you, if you clicked on it, you can select your name from the list of board members and then select your vote for each resolution. Don't hit submit until we finish the all the resolutions and then you can submit so we can, you know, tally those up, but okay, so I think that's pretty much it are you guys. Are you guys there is everyone there before we move on to the joint portion of this? Let me just speak very briefly. As the father parent of two kids in new york city, public schools, I've been very attuned to all of the issues that are, you know plaguing the reopening of schools, and originally we have our next committee meeting on the 22nd. Originally that was going to be 12 days after school open. Now, it's going to be one day after school opens. So what I plan to do for our next committee meeting- and I just want to say it here- is followed ben kaylos's, council, member kayla's suggestion and work with council members, kayla's powers and rivera to do a survey of the schools in the cb6 zone to see how the reopening has gone from their perspective and then to invite parents from those schools to come to our committee meeting and tell us how it went because we're very privileged in this zone. Our schools are generally excellent, but the this crisis across the city, when you consider that the surest predictor of high school graduation rates is second grade reading level reading levels. This is setting kids back years and could have lifelong impacts on them. So we'd like in our own way here to to try to address that and borough president brewer mentioned tutoring, and I know some of our high schools are actively working to to tutor kids. You know, through with programs based in the schools, so I'll just stop there and anybody who wants to contact me offline with any comments, thoughts or advice on that I would appreciate. Thank you great thanks, john. So I guess, if you want to move on to the the joint resolution, to introduce that, if yes clarity, you want to start and I'll chime in sandy of sandy's here, whoever is, I think it might. I don't know claire or sandy I mean I think sandy was going to sandy. You drove this in the beginning, so I think you should be the one that okay, just that this is a resolution in support of ps59, which is on 56th street, and they submitted to the DOT to our elected officials. Actually, it's they are mentioned in gail brewer's letter as one of the schools that she supports having an open street and we matt bondi is very familiar with this. He wrote the resolution and it seems like a great place to utilize a great way to utilize our streets. Yes, and also it has the support of council members, kalos and powers, and the 17th precinct has also been involved in planning this and supports it. With certain caveats regarding loading docks on the street right. Are there any questions on this resolution? Okay, is there a second wait? It looks like b desmond raised her hand, okay b yeah. I just have a question molly. Can you or the office tell us where the digital ballot is, because I don't see it on my various aspects, open the chat so underneath there's a chat, so click on the chat and it should be down there and yeah. They just posted it again. Cv6 members, you can access the ballot here, it's airtable.com. Are you do you? I open the track and I don't see it at all. Go to the very bottom scroll to the bottom of the chat you might be at the top with happy birthday greetings for sandy in there. Thank you, okay. I see it. Thank you, okay, all right. So the question has been called and it was there a second nice I couldn't. If anybody don't okay, well, you can't second here knock it off all. Okay! Thank you all right! So please vote. You know around your ballot, but don't submit so and just keep that open and we'll come back to that john. Do you have anything else for health and education? Let me just get back to my screen here. No, I think our committee meeting on the 22nd will probably be quite full with the the education part of this, especially if we have parents, but I also am very interested in reaching out through carolina council member rivera to get an update on. You know how our hospitals are prepared at this time, but I think I'm gonna take get a little bit of a sense of you know how full the agenda might be just based just with the help the education part of it. Okay, and we haven't heard from any of the other schools like we haven't heard from d.o.t on any of the schools for open streets and play streets zero so far. Well, I think there are two other schools that have opened have asked for, but nothing's back, no, nothing is back yet, though there is, I'm just not sure what the status of those applications are ps59, mainly because matt bondi drove this got ahead of the curve on this okay. Thank you all right, thanks, matt, all right, so sandy for transportation. Yes, so we have. We had a meeting in july, and so we have several resolutions from that meeting. The second avenue bike lane closing the gap on second avenue, something that we've been striving for as a board for many years, and they finally came and said that they have a solution for bringing the bike lane all the way from 43rd down to 34th, and if we actually approve this, they are going to start to implement it right away, which is fantastic. It's an incredibly well used bike lane and it's quite a dangerous situation. The way it is currently I'm tired of moving the barricades in place. I'm you know a few of us are just doing that on a regular basis. Okay, any questions, okay, none, okay, gene call! The question is there a second? Oh, is there a second? I guess I can. Second this one. Yes thank you. Thank you, john pamela, okay, pam's waving yeah. I can't I'm not able to see all this screen. Sorry, yeah. Okay, so please vote on resolution, seven, a supporting, closing second avenue bicycling gap and sandy for 7b, and this also came to us at the july meeting and it's a proposal for crosstown bike lanes of 38th and 39th street and they have been temporary and now the DOT is actually working to implement them and they go completely across the island. It's a it's part of the network that they've established through our district, and actually this is one of the last ones that they're going to implement. Okay questions, saying none call a question check it: pam! Okay, thank you, I'm not sure who said that actually ryan said it. Oh brian! Thank you all right. So please vote on 7b, I'm having some trouble getting to the ballot and marking it properly. I'm not sure what I'm doing incorrectly. Okay, let's see so, are you in the chat? Did you go to the chat and click on it? Click on the airtable.com lube, I've clicked on chat. I've got the resolution, you need again it's having problems, I'm having the same problem. So you know what we can do is we do have some people that need to vote verbally at the end. So we'll can we can we do that and seema will request the votes. If anyone is having difficulty, do you do you know if there's cody or jesus brendan, I don't know it seems to all it is working fine man on our end, yeah, I'm able to access it. So I don't know if maybe it could be the internet or maybe those who are having trouble, if perhaps it opens in a browser? That's not your usual browser. Maybe you can just take the little url and paste it into your normal browser that might help clear it. I'm in chrome, but maybe maybe there's another. Oh yeah, I'm using chrome as well and rich is suggesting that what jesus said that perhaps switching browsers but rich is having an issue in chrome as well. Oh okay seems to be working. Fine for us, maybe refresh the page, if you were having an issue: okay, all right so and we'll go we'll get back to that lou, for if you're unable to vote we'll, go we'll go back to that and be okay, so sandy for supporting the queen's ribbon, and this was a presentation that sam schwartz made to us at our last meeting and it's a proposal to build a pedestrian and bicycle bridge that would connect Queens to Manhattan understanding that we don't have the money for this now, it's a bit of a long shot, but it's something that seems like a great idea and many other cities are building these types of bridges and since we're the we we're the place where a lot of cars land, we thought it's a good idea to actually have bicycles and pedestrians land here as well. So many questions somebody had a ballot contact that just I didn't see until the last second. Can we have that back again, please, the ballot! The link to the ballot is in the chat is the most recent message at the bottom of the chat window: scroll all the way down there, you go lulu put it back there. Yes, air table your table. Okay, any questions on sam schwartz's, it's a beautiful thing. I just oh gene. You have a yeah, it's not so much a question as just to expand. Something sandy said about the about the planning, for this is the idea behind this is not to do it now. The target is 27.. The idea is that if we get lucky, as we hope to be in the november elections, for example, that there will be the kind of bailout programs for infrastructure that happened in 2008 2009 at the beginning of the great recession and that time new york was caught without shovel ready projects. So a lot of asphalt was laid all around this town, but no significant infrastructure was built, and this is a this is a beginning of trying to identify things that we can set in motion so that when that day comes when the money comes in, we have things we can go to the feds with and say we're ready. Here they go. So that's part of what's going on. I just want the greenway connected. We think this is going to help. Oh bro, oh cindy, go ahead. Yeah. We think this is going to help connect the greenway. So if this bridge lands it's got to connect to the greenway, so it should really help us fill in that gap in the greenway as well brian. I just wanted to add a a thing that I I have had a really tumultuous week and haven't been able to follow up with sandy, but the resolved asked for the bikeway to be usable for all the categories. There was some discussion in the meeting about recommending that the bikeway or the total width of the thing is at least 20 to 30 feet wide. It's not included specifically in the resolution was that's. That was our solution to address that. It really has to acknowledge that there are three different types of users, so if they design it with that way, we feel it will respond to your concerns. We might when we come back across this in the future. We have to be adamant about this, because the the new tappan zee bridge was designed for pedestrians and bicyclists and road bicyclists, but it's only 13 feet wide and there was there's been a lot of conflicts on it, because the state designed it insufficiently to serve all those populations safely, even though they allow access to all of them all right. Is there any other questions for 7c? Oh wait. Okay, can I call you question? Oh yeah and I have a question. I have to say something: yes yeah. I just want to say for the record that I'd heard from the sutton place in beekman place folks, and they just were feeling- and I understand turtle bay is probably the lead on this- that they, just I guess they were. They felt very put out that they were not notified about this. I know we have public, you know all of this is public and I and I just wanted to say for the record at least that was their feeling. It doesn't affect my thinking, but I just wanted to say, and I, as a matter of fact, I did speak to charles patino of sac this afternoon and I asked him pointedly whether he was going to speak tonight or and or anybody from turtle bay was going to speak tonight and he said he was busy and he didn't think they were. So I just wanted you to know that I had asked them and obviously they didn't come so be it. I also said to them: this was only a concept and that that's all it was an idea. Yeah. Okay, thank you. So I just wanted to put that on the record and you know just leave it there. Good. Okay, thank you. Thank you and no. I was just calling a question. Okay! Is there a second okay? We got susan seconded sandy 7d 17., so this is. This is a request to don't we need to vote so this is a resolution asking the police precincts to actually open up the streets for public uses. We have two precincts that are still blocking the streets. We did write a letter to them asking them if they could please consider opening them and at least give us a timetable. So this is to reinforce that letter and also it's in support of the letter that Manhattan borough president gail brewer wrote- and she talked about earlier in the meeting. Yes so and we did and we have been talking to the commanding officers, so we're working with them, but they're just not open and they were invited to speak tonight but kind of short notice, andrew yeah, my I just wanted to like what you and sandy said, which is that you know in the discussion. This is clarification I did raise and it was raised. You know if you know we're, given an opportunity to discuss this out of fairness. You know and the fact that both the both the commissioner and the priesthood did not not only not respond but didn't participate. You know, I think, was a factor and some of this decision making and I think it's important for the full board to know that yeah and then and in fairness andrew. They did respond to me just in conversations, but you know it was just at a build a block meeting a few weeks ago and this and separately just by phone on the commanding officers, and they just said they won't because of the riots- and you know they're it. You know we don't agree, but that they have their. They have some safety concerns, so I've asked them. You know to come to some of our meetings, and so I hope they attend our housing, homeless and human rights. So we can discuss some issues. We want to work with them right. We want to work with them on this and all the issues. You know that they're dealing with as well as we all are dealing with right now, so try to try to keep that line of communication. Open, I mean part of the problem with the barricades is that it's really in the police are completely inaccessible now, so it sets up. It sets up yet another level of inability to communicate with them. I do think that jim might have a question he's having a hard time raising his hand and then we'll move the electronically, but I don't seem to be able to do it we'll try to keep an eye on you physically. All right did you have a question jim not with respect to this, not on this particular issue. There I didn't have an issue on eight, something eight c or a d. I forget okay, so 7d did we already call the question? No, we need to call the question, I'm just since we're talking about it and talking about speaking to the police. Afterwards, I'm just wondering if it's something you might want to lay over until you have those discussions, the seven seasons and we've talked to them several times, we're talking to them. Yeah, I'm talking them. Okay, call the question! One question: I'm asking come on gene. Is there a second okay and okay? Please vote on 7d asking local precincts to quit, blocking the streets sandy and then our next resolution actually ann and andrew work together on this one and it's to assess the utilization of metered parking in midtown east and there it was notice that there's because of the particular configuration very residential that we may want to look more closely at how parking is used in this neighborhood. And if there are any questions, either ann or andrew can answer them. Questions for seven e and or andrew it looks like pamela pam basil wants to pour pam, oh she's, on mute, pam you're on mute. Okay, all I wanted to say I'm so sorry molly. You referred in the last thing to riots, and I would rather in the minutes that it said demonstrations instead of riots. No, that's what they're! That's what the police say riots. So we have to say that the police say riots and protests they're I mean they are concerned for their safety. You know, okay, I shut up yeah they that they say it over and over to me. So our resolution does not say right all right. So for 7e, hey, there's! No one calling the question I'm going to just move for the vote. Okay, so please vote on 7e, 7f! Sorry, we have so many. We do they're all good they're, all good yeah they're all good. This is this came out of one of the meetings that I think molly had with. Oh, he froze oh actually sandy, you froze, and I I'm I don't know if anyone else sees it sandy froze but okay. Well, I'm sorry, molly! Well we're getting her back. Was that supposed to be seven e, because seven e is about the metered parking? That's that reso seven e is what we were. No, we had no questions and we people can vote on 7e, for there was no. There were no questions for that. That's right! It's not in place south yeah we're on we're talking about sudden play south gene. Do you want to speak to that or letty could probably even speak to that since she lives right, he wants to do it. That's fine! No gene go ahead. Are you I yeah? Okay? I didn't have. I didn't have much to do with this resource. Oh okay! Well I yeah, and I just had calls from the from sac and from the neighborhood and this the office that had complaints we've dealt with it before and it was a service issue, but it hasn't been fixed and so as you, if you go to 53rd and sudden place south, you see the cars exiting the fdr at high speeds, and you know there. The sign is not very clear that it says 25 miles an hour anyway. There's poor signage there's a lot of pedestrians, it's very dangerous, so we're asking DOT for safety enhancements there. That's really all that is any questions on that question, oh adam! What little adam may have a question or adam? No, I was going to agree with you and call the question. Okay, I was just gonna call it a question and ann is the second, I'm counting you as a second anne. Okay, all right! So please vote on 7f and sandy claire dean. Do you have a report claire? Maybe claire can go. I think sandy we lost sandy, so claire, do you want to do you have anything? No. I think that was enough time to report. Appreciate it. Okay, thank you all right. So, let's go to am I missing anyone kyle a tide for business affairs and street activities. All right, hey, everybody, hope everyone's having a good evening. Would you like me to walk through each of these? The last two can be bundled it's good to see applications in our neighborhood again, but the rest of them are different. Yep, please yeah, and these were sent to everyone. So hopefully, y'all are looking at these you've read them, but yeah I'll just give a quick summary for each of them sure. So a is about Covid-19, 19 surcharges to business and service providers. This was actually something that was brought up from the experiences of people within our district of charges that started popping up when they were trying to access certain services, the most visible one was. If anyone went to the dentist, there were certain charges that were added on top of the normal billing, because pbes were required. This particular resolution is about the transparency of those charges. It doesn't make a statement on the charges themselves, but ensuring that individuals, before they make a purchase of a good or service, are aware of any associated coded 19 surcharges that affects the price of that. Okay, and I want to thank yousef and susan for taking the lead on that resolution. Great questions, okay, see. None. Can we move for a vote? Well, the question be and pam seconds. Okay, please vote on eight a and kyle all right, so moving on to b. So this is again something that was brought up in our community, about businesses and third-party delivery. Apps. Of course, city council order in the quarantine took some actions relating to the capping the charges that businesses were being charged in order to use those platforms which, of course, affected businesses that were already struggling. Another issue that we found within it that was particularly relevant during kovid is that there were some businesses that were listed as closed on the app if they chose to delist themselves from that app and use another platform. If you went on to it was saying that they were closed when in fact they were open again. This affects businesses that already struggling. So we wanted to make sure that there were measures to protect small businesses from that something very simple, just to ensure that apps would delist any businesses that chose not to use those platforms instead of showing that they were closed, and you know making a customer go to another business that people could understand that they were just simply not using that platform. Oh I'm sorry, larry had a question. Yes, I have a quick question: what were some of the platforms that were causing a problem, so the it was mentioned on grubhub and seamless were the two big ones that were mentioned. There was actually an article in the new york times that jim shared with our committee actually spoke on it because his local delhi was actually affected by this, and this was actually something that was happening in other states as well, where the business was listed as closed, even though they were open. So the fact that we had heard this you wanted to make sure that no third-party app could do something of this nature yeah. This is a good one, all right, yeah larry, I miss you. I haven't seen you have you just popped up on my screen? I haven't okay, so can we move forward? Okay, are you calling a question? Yes, second, okay and larry. Second, all right, please vote on 8b, 8c, so 8c. So to give background, our committee was discussing a lot of things we actually put out 10 resolutions this summer. After our most recent meeting, we decided to consolidate because a lot of these resolutions were similar in nature, because they were all about small business relief and economic recovery, so this was based on conversations and presentations that we had from our local officials. We heard about some of them earlier today during the elected officials section about different proposals that they're putting out at the assembly level, the senate level, as well as the city and the city controllers office as well. So these are a bunch of different plans that all affect small businesses, whether it comes to business interruption insurance. So for those who are unaware, some people had insurance that covered pandemic literally pandemic in it and are not receiving the benefits of that insurance policy. For some others, it's just it's something that doesn't exist, so this bill incorporates all of that. One of our most recent applicants actually had mentioned that she's in a fight with her insurance company, because she does have pandemic coverage she's one of the few businesses who actually had that and wasn't getting the benefits. So we have a bill on that, as well as what we heard from senator hoylman they're, calling it to save our storefront bill, and then we also have the plans that were put forth by city council member keith powers, as well as the city comptroller, which we heard about earlier today. So all of these, our committee was very much in support of. We had a lot of feedback and questions and things that were included in these plans, and so we are supporting that, because time is off the essence for a lot of these small businesses. Thank you, kyle questions for kyle right here yeah. I have a question: okay, kyle. I I'm all for the the business interruption insurance, but I have an issue with the forcing landlords to take a suspension of the rent payments for commercial businesses. I think it. I think it violates the takings clause of the fifth amendment, so I can't vote for it. So this is so this is yeah. So that's obviously in your right. This is actually a great point that you bring up, because this is something that I personally have actually to the senator and the assembly member's office. They actually have resources for landlords who are affected by the 20 or the one-third calculation landlords are affected by that, because one of the things that we often forget is that landlords aren't necessarily these big corporations all the time. Sometimes they are working-class people themselves who are making their income and their livelihood from property ownership, so they actually have a clause within that as well, where, if a landlord is affected by the 20 percent or one third calculation, they actually have resources with the department of financial services. I believe it is to support them in bridging that gap and again that goes for all I mean you use. You seem to segregate it there between independent businesses and large corporations. It really doesn't matter. Yes, there is the constitution, so yeah, so that it's for everybody in terms of how you're doing that, I don't believe it for everybody yeah. I don't believe it's for everybody. I believe it's for people who are impacted by it and they have another calculation for that as well. I don't think that flies. Sorry, okay, I'm all in favor of the other, the other end of it. If you can segregate the two that would be fine, but otherwise I guess I'm gonna have to stain or whatever all right. Thank you for that thanks. Jim. Are there question other questions? Can we move the to a vote b? Is there a second? Yes, let's call the question: pam is seconding. Okay, please vote on 8 c and a d sure. So again. Actually this was mentioned almost a verbatim earlier tonight. So one of the things that we noticed very early on with outdoor dining, just from even our own personal experiences, was that the environment was affected. By this there was a lot of sanitation pileup within the corner, garbage cans themselves, commercial garbage on the sides of streets which were just overflowing. It was hard to walk in certain areas and then, of course, this also led to an increase in rats and bugs- and you know other vermin- there were articles about this as well, so we put together a resolution asking the department of sanitation to re-evaluate their scheduled delivery, particularly in areas that have high concentration of restaurants and bars, which can also be related to how many outdoor dining permits have been issued as well. So we wanted to make sure that those with high concentrations of those were being serviced, and then part of this resolution as well is about composting. So composting is something very important to us and we put that in as well, because we thought that would also have a very positive impact in terms of the garbage that's accumulating, as well as making sure that everything is environmentally friendly. Okay, yeah- and I know that keith powers sent his newsletter out this morning or this afternoon, and he talked about helping to fund some of the sanitation with ace. So we should all be. You know working to try to find other ways to work with dsny, but also you know other ways to you know empty our very full trash cans throughout our district call. The question: okay sandy, all right, please vote on 8d and we have two liquor license: applications, 8e and 8f motion bundle. Brian is there. Oh, I missed that. I missed hearing that is there a second to bundle? I can't adam. Second, okay, there's, probably no explanation. You see the addresses there and the businesses if there are no questions on eight e and a f for kyle. If you have no comments caught a question, okay, question's been called second pam. All right, please vote on 8e and 8f kyle. Do you have a report? I do yeah. So, first of all, I need to thank the committee, everyone on the committee and the board staff as well, because this was a very busy summer. As I mentioned, we put out 10 resolutions based on all of the different issues that we were facing and a lot of it was in real time. We actually had a resolution that we had passed over the summer about having the city and state put together a plan for indoor dining which we had to pull out because, obviously earlier today the governor had mentioned a plan on indoor dining part of that resolution as well was about extending outdoor dining and having because, of course, this is only 25 percent and going up to 50 occupancy. So if a business is able to do the outdoor dining, we thought that should be extended that to them as an option, but we pulled that out and we'll be discussing that at our next meeting, because obviously a lot is changing. But I do have to thank everybody on the committee for first of all meeting throughout the summer and all of the work they did on that. I do have some information. There were a couple of different programs that the city started over the summer. The first one is something called mediating, establishment and neighbor disputes. The acronym is mend and it's mend NYC and it's a city-wide initiative for free mediation and conflict resolution, as it relates to businesses and residents and quality of life issues. So I believe we sent that throughout one of the wednesday emails, but that is a resource that is available to the public as well, and that's a really exciting thing, because we were often dealing with that conflict resolution as a committee. Ourselves. Second point is that the there was also another report that was submitted by the mayor's office of media and entertainment. The office of nightlife, as you remember, that's a new office at the city level. It's called the multi-agency response to community hotspots march is the acronym, so they put out a report for the first two quarters of 2020, where they did surprise inspections throughout the city, making sure you know anytime, there was a complaint that was received that they inspected that, and so this was a cross agency between the dep DOB mental health, fdny NYPD. Our specific district was not. It was not part of the initial investigation. There were, I believe, about two or three sites that were in upper Manhattan that were inspected, but it's an interesting report and it's just something to be aware of, and then just the last part is like, as I mentioned, there's a lot changing, there's a lot. That's obviously live in terms of plans and initiatives, so at our next community board or next committee meeting at the end of september, we'll be discussing a lot of these things, of course by then, hopefully, we'll get more information on the indoor dining plan. But while it is a positive there is a lot to be discussed about that. Just because it's an option doesn't mean that business owners feel comfortable hiring the amount of people that would be required to staff, indoor, dining or the public health concerns. And then again, as I mentioned earlier, the capacity is 25 later this month and then up to 50 and part of our indoor dining bill was that after october 31st no one really has an idea of how to proceed and so for business owners and for obviously the employees there's a lot of uncertainty. So I thought it was best to pull that out, just as we were receiving more information about it, but we'll definitely be discussing that at our next committee meeting, and so I encourage everybody to attend, and one of the great things is that a lot of our work was influenced by a lot of people from the public, but also other community board members from other committees who have been witnessing and experiencing things and providing their perspective to the conversation. So I would encourage people to continue to do that as well and that's all I have yeah all right. Thank you very much, all right, so pam vassell, chair parks, landmarks and cultural affairs you're on mute, I'm unmuted! Now right. Can you hear me? Yes, okay, good, so I don't have much to say except to report on one thing, which is the saint vorton's redesign of the playground, and so we had a discussion about it. At our last meeting there was a kind of a hoo-ha which we didn't know about until after the meeting was over, but there were like 40 people who were grousing about one thing or another, so we tried to figure out a way in which we could listen to the things they wanted to suggest or the questions that they had and we think we've come up with a viable solution. We presented the solution, they pushed back. So again we have another solution. This is kind of it, but what they'll do in a nutshell, is they will meet together as a group, they will write their comments concisely. There can be 10 of them who will come to our next october meeting in which they will present the items that they that are concerns for them prior to that meeting they will send that list to us and to steve, simon and and we'll be able to talk about it and hopefully write a resolution and move forward and that's kind of where we are. We feel very strongly that as a community board, we, it is incumbent upon us to listen to our constituency so that when the park opens it they it opens to rejoicing and not bad feelings. Well, it's a nice park so as it is, but there it's just for improvements in the whole full park and the playground and the ball field, but this is solely about the playground. Okay, so thank you. That's you're! Welcome! Thank you. Okay, all right thanks, pam and we'll move to last, but not least, adam hartkey for land use and waterfront hello good evening. Everyone. Thank you all.
