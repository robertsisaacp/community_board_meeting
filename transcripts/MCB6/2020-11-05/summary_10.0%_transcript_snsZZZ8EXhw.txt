There's time following the committee's discussion, we'll field questions from the public.
This is Anshul Kapoor and my boss, Doug Lane, we're from lane engineering, and we are the applicants for the window replacement project at 321, East, 43Rd Street, also known as the cluster now quickly talking about the building layout, the front facade faces south there's, an interior, courtyard , there's, an interior courtyard and two side yards facing east and West.
These are first of all, two independent units, so in the middle is the It's a fixed panel and joined by two out swing casements and with the transom on the top and image to the left to the right is a typical bathroom window, and here we're trying to show you some of the conditions found at the ex at the the steel frame on the south, facade and The building is currently under an extensive, exterior restoration, work, and if I can, please share some more photos which we, which we were able to take during our scaffold drop.
Now the scope of work here, which I said before, is replacing the existing steel casement window with tutor City approved Series, 96, outswing, casement, windows, aluminum, casement windows by Skyline, and in addition to that, we are also proposing installation of louvers for portable ac exhaust hose and the location for those are located at specific windows.
If, you see we're trying to show the louver and the intention is to paint it black, so it merges with the the proposed metal framing and also we're trying to show here a comparison to the previously approved window ac unit installed at 25, tudor city, which is actually shows a sash.
So we kind of followed that design idea and located the louvers and also at the same time we looked at the individual apartment layout and tried to locate the lure by the first window to the entrance into the room.
The continued discussion regarding the proposed design for the reconstruction of the Saint Varton Park Playground.
Our design director is also on this call of Leslie peoples and either one of them may jump in at some point and provide some additional info for the presentation, but Benjamin take it away thanks My name is Benjamin Nicolosiendo Landscape architect, with New York City parks So, to remind those who have not attended the last few meetings back in February, we did have the scope meeting to discuss which areas of the park everyone would like to see reconstructed and we have a limited budget unfortunately, and can not address all the areas of same far in so at that meeting.
The end of that meeting, the playground was chosen as the area of greatest interest and these stats that you're seeing are stickers that were placed on the drawing by those in attendance.
The park is located at 1St, Avenue and East 35Th Street, the East River, is about a block away, and the entrance to the Midtown tunnel is just to the north and to reorient those who have not attended previous meetings.
We previously mentioned this at past meetings and the playground which was chosen I'll show a close- up of that shortly and the two main entrances are along First Avenue and they ramp up into the playground area right beside the garden along First Avenue.
There's swings to the north and South There's large play equipment, that is in the center of the space.
These trees, provide a lot of shade throughout the site, which is nice, And they're, mostly in healthy condition, and their root zones do need to be protected, So most of the trees will remain so we're just showing this slide just to indicate that there is a significant constraint on where certain play features can be placed because of so many existing trees around the playground.
This was the schematic design that was presented back in September was created to address the community comments back in February It features a large bike and scooter track and spray shower.
And I'll show that shortly regarding play equipment, we showed you a design with many climbers, as was originally requested.
We also discussed site furniture last month, and it was mentioned that people like the existing picnic tables and we are able to keep them if they are relocated.
There's a consolidated gated entrance to the playground that makes a safer and more defined space and to the west There's a wider, more visible pathway that leads to the multi- purpose area.
There's a geometric spray shower, and it has flush spray features to allow it to be a multi- purpose, play space, there's also small sort of This Was in response to a request that was made at the last meeting and above that we have an area for tire swings and The. Tire swings are in a similar location to where the tire swings are now.
So, the only interior fences that are there, are placed only whether necessary for like safety as in the areas for the swings.
If you look to the west, there's two new gates that lead to the multi- purpose area and the sort of the x's to the north and south of this diagram.
Entrance and, as I mentioned, previously, we'll use the same style bench and table as what is currently in the park, and a new lamppost will be placed in a few locations to make sure the space is more evenly.
The nearby contacts, the gold of the dome from saint Fartin and November to the east, we'll be placing shade, tolerant and native plants were appropriate on site and new trees and plantings will be kept to the perimeter of the playground as requested and once more, the schematic plan, which I can remain on for comments and questions.
The features in the spray Shower area also be used without the water, as previously discussed?
If we want to be able to provide lots of different play equipment for five to twelve and two to five entire swings, and, as I mentioned previously, Because of the various tree constraints, that's the one area that where we could place a cluster of tables, whether it be two or four Also I'll, just add, you do have still two existing areas of two tables: each.
It says we had showed pictures of other parks that had actual structures in the water area.
It conflicts a little bit with what with what we heard at the last meeting, which was to have an open, multi- purpose space, and we also had a few comments saying that from some community members who did not want any high structures within the spray shower, area.
There will be a double gate right at the entrance right across from the comfort station Will the turf be put in most likely in the we're talking now about the multi- purpose, play area?
Are you in agreement that you approve of this, because I know that Steve is going to need a resolution?
The friends of Albano Jr. Playground, would like to get process updates on Bellevue, South, Park procurement and construction, progress.
Think it's premature right now to talk about moving the money, but, That would be great because I know they're very concerned that the that rosie had given the money for the park We're very disappointed that the that the MTA is not allowed us to proceed with that project.
, I'm, the park manager, I'll try to maybe I'll start off with the glitch question, which is it's actually not a sinkhole, but it is an area where the you may not know it, but that area is actually built upon piers.
It could be pause, but generally speaking, that, because it's like emergency fencing, I'm just know that we have proposed it to be put out the bid for a an altered, alternate, fencing or something taller, fencing, and just specifically in that one area that we're concerned with until the entire park goes under construction.
One of the concerns from the PTA groups was that they would still like to have some bike riding area They were the new plans that does not have any place to ride a bike, so that will be road space that could possibly be used for that purpose.
