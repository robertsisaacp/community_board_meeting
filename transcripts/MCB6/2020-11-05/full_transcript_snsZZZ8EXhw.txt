Now I have an interesting issue tonight, which is I need someone to take the minutes. Is there anyone who would volunteer do not we'll jump at once. Anybody want to raise your hand cute mark anyway. Well, I do not know no one's stepping up to the plate here, so cody will we just have to tape. It is that how it works. Well, the meetings are recorded and archived on YouTube regardless, so someone who's not here, could even take minutes if they want to spend some time after the fact who's. Not here there are several people who are not here. Raj is raj here I'll. Do it I'll take the minutes on again. That's very nice of you, oh my goodness, you're too nice I wanted raj to do it.

We could divide and conquer rock paper scissors. Thank you genie. This will be your last time to ever. Take notes in this committee. Do not do that. Do not say that okay, I won't. I won't okay. So now we're going to take attendance and cody will do it and he's going to conduct the roll call all right. Committee members, I'll call your name, please unmute yourself, when your name is called and say present and I'll announce if there's Quorum Pam vassell here, Kevin O'keefe, present Martin Barrett President, here rajnier here, Sean Sherman, Sean, Okay, Mark Thompson, I'm tiptoeing in these tours Ronnie White, Ronnie, Gary, Papish, Dean stephanies. Here all right. That is a corner. That's nine members present excellent. So the agenda for tonight's meeting was distributed ahead of time by the board office and appears on the screen before you. If there is no objection we'll adopt the agenda, as stated members of the committee, if you object to adopting the com the agenda, you may raise your hand through zoom, well seeing no hands and no objection. Oh, we got a script on the ear with that. Is that an objection or a scratch? Sorry! So seeing no objections, the agenda for tonight's meeting is adopted. The same thing is true of the minutes. They were distributed ahead of time by the board office. If there's no objection we'll adopt these minute minutes. If you have any objection, anyone on the committee just raise your hand through zoom, okay. Seeing no objection so the minutes are adopted so now cody is going to give us a little screen share and, while he's doing that, I just want to say to everyone that we have some ground rules for tonight. In order to really have an efficient meeting, let's observe some of these ground rules. No one can speak unless granted by the floor. I guess I would be the floor. The committee members, if you have a question about committee business or wish to make a motion, please raise your hand through zoom. If you click the participants icon, the participants panel should appear and you can find the raised hand function there. If you still have technical difficulty, you may click the chat, icon and relay your difficulty, non- committee member members, who have been invited as panelists to tonight's meeting. If you have a question about committee business, please raise your hand through zoom. The chat function should not be used by committee for committee business or for questions raised about agenda topics. All such remarks should be made on the record by raising your hand through zoom chats should only be used to alert us to any technical difficulties you are having or to state in writing information like an email address, or something like that was already stated aloud on the record during the meeting when a committee member is given the floor to speak, I will identify you and you can unmute yourself so that you can speak okay, so we are required by the executive by executive order to create a verbatim transcript of the meeting. So please keep your questions and comments, succinct and germain to the discussion, and so let us begin tonight's agenda. I guess cody's going to put it up on the screen or not so maybe not so. The first thing on the agenda is a certificate of appropriateness to replace the windows at 321, East, 43Rd Street. So I'm not sure who is going to present this okay. Well, this is Doug Lane, with lean engineering and on the zoom call also is anchor kapoor. Who was the lead, the lead architect in the design, work on this project I'd like, and should we jump into it or how should we proceed jump? Okay, so are we going to share the presentation, or should we or is someone going to share the presentation? Yeah I mean I can share my screen. If that makes easier for everybody yeah, you should be able to share your screen right now. That way, you can advance the slides yourself. Okay, yes, okay, thanks all right is this: okay, can everyone see the screen? We can? Okay, great all right, just wanted to make sure all right so hello to everyone again. This is Anshul Kapoor and my boss, Doug Lane, we're from lane engineering, and we are the applicants for the window replacement project at 321, East, 43Rd Street, also known as the cluster now quickly talking about the building layout, the front facade faces south there's, an interior courtyard, there's, an interior courtyard and two side yards facing east and West. The north elevation is the rare side now located in the Tudor City historic district. This building was built in 1928. There are total 11 floors which includes the penthouse, and I would like to point out that the penthouse windows are not included as part of this application for replacement now. So just a brief talk on the appearance of the building, it's a red brick masonry with decorative terracotta and limestone elements on the South facade, and this is a view of the back elevation, which is the north and a West Courtyard Center, Courtyard and East courtyard. So the front facade has steel, casement windows and all other facades have double hung. Aluminum windows going back to page four, so this image here shows an interior view of one of the styles of window configuration on the front facade the image on the left shows. These are first of all, two independent units, so in the middle is the it's a fixed panel and joined by two out swing casements and with the transom on the top and image to the left to the right is a typical bathroom window, and here we're trying to show you some of the conditions found at the ex at the the steel frame on the south facade and also at this point, the building is currently under an extensive, exterior restoration work, and if I can, please share some more photos which we, which we were able to take during our scaffold drop inspections. To give you an idea on a close- up view how they look, let's see. Well, you look great. Thank you all right. Let's see, if can you see the images yeah they're, very, barely small they're small icons? Is it better now hold on? No, I think you're sharing a screen. That's not you're, not sharing the right screen. Maybe you do not see the image. Yes, there are eight images, but they're very small they're like it looks like they need to be clicked on or something so. This is just an overview of the front facade sections of masonry been taken out, and you know we terra cotta replacement things like that. This is all exterior project, but just to give you a close up view of how the window conditions are from Exterior, it shows the damaged metal, framing steel framing on the outside. This one includes a silver placement: it's a slate sale again damage framing on the window above similar condition, change those windows. I think you're, scaring them enough. Yeah, I'm going to get back to my presentation so moving ahead. This is the elevation drawing for the south facade. Now the scope of work here, which I said before, is replacing the existing steel casement window with tutor City approved Series, 96, outswing, casement windows, aluminum casement windows by Skyline, and in addition to that, we are also proposing installation of louvers for portable ac exhaust hose and the location for those are located at specific windows. This slide actually gives a better zoomed in version of what you know, what exactly we're proposing with the louvers so on the left is a rendering if I zoom in for the partial view of the south facade on the bottom, two lights of the left hand sash. If you see we're trying to show the louver and the intention is to paint it black, so it merges with the the proposed metal framing and also we're trying to show here a comparison to the previously approved window ac unit installed at 25, tudor city, which is actually shows a sash, an individual sash created in order for the Ac unit to be installed moving forward. This is an elevation drawing again showing a comparison between the two and also the amount of glazing reduction between the two designs on the left is the one showing about eight inch diameter of exhaust hose in comparison to a full ac unit installed at other Tudor city building, with the Lp's previously approved LPC design. So, basically, just to stop here yeah. What you're proposing is just to have a vent in the window and ac to be an internal air conditioning unit that rolls on wheels or something like that right, whereas the other one is an actual through the window ac unit, that's not portable, it just is in there that's correct, okay, so the intent is to get as much operable window and as much light as possible and have the most the minimal most minimal impact to the to the visual of the of the front facade right. So basically, the impact will be on these portable units inside the unit of the exactly right, leaseholder right so, and that is that was a building decision to go in this direction and have it as a requirement to require that these portable units be used in lieu of the through the window or sleeved acs. Are they noisy the portable ones? Yep? No, not at all. In fact, most of the noise of the compressor is actually interior to your apartment and they're, pretty quiet I mean compared to the window units I think they are far superior. Noise, wise and also exterior noise is dropped, especially if you're in a courtyard, a courtyard scenario where you have a window unit installed facing somebody else, is far more noisy than having just this hose. You know blowing out, which you can you can't even hear sorry is. It is a hose, a little blue on the left of the bottom left to bottom right. I thought you said the left, but the rendering has it on the right now I'll. Take you back to the elevator. So, yes, we have, you know based on the location, so we've actually followed the the the exterior design of the facade. It's like it's symmetrical around the center, so we kind of followed that design idea and located the louvers and also at the same time we looked at the individual apartment layout and tried to locate the lure by the first window to the entrance into the room. So it kind of lines up with the exterior feature of the building and also it functions the functions well with the interior used. Thank you yeah and more slowly. The windows match the old style. Yes, that's correct, and is there anything you can do with that unit? So it's not like a piece of furniture in your living room. It's surprisingly unobtrusive. I know that photo may have not explained it right. I used to have one, it's really easy. I mean I went since before we had ac and that's what I had in my bedroom and they're, really nothing. It's really pretty cool, very small, and you wheel it around and if you do not want it in your window, you just pull the hose out of the thing and put in your closet. Now. Did yours have heat in it too? No, we do not need to get. We get blasted with heat inside okay. This is only ac for the summer gotcha, so it really does provide the most flexibility, especially since let's say that unit could be the hose could be lengthened slightly. You could move it around. You push it to the corner. You could pull it. You know behind another piece of furniture and the throw the how far the fan blows. The cool air is really a benefit to these. They they're pretty powerful yeah. Okay, so I does anyone have a question. I mean an additional question. Okay, I have a question first, what is it that you need? Do you need a letter from us and when are you presenting? What's your time frame presenting to the landmarks yeah, we were told that the next available hearing is December 8th. So you need a letter from us. Is that is that what you need or no letter? We need a resolution, a result, yeah a resolution. Okay, so is there someone who'd like to step up and write a resolution? Someone on the committee? Oh my goodness, come on guys. I need a resolution writer. I can write the resolution pam. This is Reishima. Okay, thank you. So much reshma, that's terrific, and are we in agreement that we we approve this idea by show of hands cody? Am I doing that right? We should do just a roll call just to have it recorded. Okay. So do you want to roll call away sure one moment all right, so this is a resolution of question. Are there do you have more slides? Are you are you through your presentation? Well, the remaining slides included details showing you, okay. I want to make sure we did not cut you short it's. These are the same windows that have been previously approved in Tudor City, but I do not know Griezmann. If you want to Ju Ancho, do you want to just run through it? That'd be great run through the slides, the rest of the slides? Let's just okay yeah I mean the remaining were, was the slide that I wanted to talk about? Was the the rear and courtyard facades? We have double hung windows. We are painting them to match existing color, which is which is white and also changing. The double hung windows with another 1000 series, double Hung, aluminum windows and the glazing is actually better. If I remember right yes, these are. These are energy efficient windows? Yes, and you do not need landmark approval for that, because they're in an interior court? Well, you do in that it's an exterior. It's usually does not have the hurdle that the the front facade has right, and that unit is a person who lives there eligible to get more than one or it's just one. For the bedroom, or is it one per room for the air conditioners? Yes, it's per room, if I remember correctly, yes, okay and then Pam. I can do a resolution of no objection for this, so I'd like to if there's a second thank you, okay, I'll committee members, I'll call your name, please unmute yourself and declare in favor against abstain or not entitled on the motion. Pan Vassal, fine with me: yes, Martin Barrett, yes, Matt Bondi! Yes, all right, Genie, Dinofrio, yes, Anton Mullner! Yes, rajnier did you! I do not see that Sean has joined us either: Mark Thompson, yes and Dean, stephanies. Yes, all right! That's nine in favor! No against no abstentions! No, not entitled! Okay! So thank you very much for coming to present to us and we appreciate what you've shown us and we'll send you that Rezo. Thank you! So much! Okay, all right! Thank you! Everyone! Thank you! So much! Thank you. Thanks! Bye- bye! Good luck have fun. Oh! Thank you all right! Okay! Please end the screen here! Thank you, okay. So, let's move on to the next topic, which is the whoops the continued discussion regarding the proposed design for the reconstruction of the Saint Varton Park Playground. I just want to make sure that we have the the PTA groups who are present and watching so that they can see what's going on we're joined by by Erica and some others, okay, great okay, so Steve do you want to take it away, or do you want someone else to start? How do you want to do this? Give me your home, okay, we're hearing, echoes and, and two of you actually yeah, Steve you've joined twice, so one of your accounts has to mute yeah. Send it over to Wes. He's got two also how about now perfect much better, much better, okay, great okay. So this presentation, of course, is going to be the highlight of your meeting, because we've we're showing once again, I believe how responsive we've been to the Community board's input and that of the people from the community who critiqued our initial design and- and we then had a, I think, a pretty fruitful discussion at your last meeting. We then went back and reviewed the comments and we was very significantly have changed the design and, I believe, have taken into account all of the major requests that we received and and try to address the concerns of of the community as presented to us. So what we're going to offer show you now is a is a revised version of the presentation which you saw back in back in September when we made the original presentation and for the best for the benefit of the people, who may not have seen that presentation, we're going to show you the the revised design in full context with all of the as part of the larger presentation. So if you could just be a little patient for those of you who may have already seen the presentation, there'll be some repetition, but we need to be able to put it all together as one overall presentation. So, as you know, Ben could we go back to the years back to the yeah. So, as you know, this is a project which has been funded by the mayor and by council member powers. The mayor has provided 3.18 million. The council member has provided 1.31 million so overall, it's a project has a projected budget of 4.5 million and Steve that's fixed, no matter what happens that money is there for the park. Well, it's there for the playground. Yes, yeah, that's what I mean for the playground. Sorry, okay, I mean listen. You can't really tell these days with the financial crisis we're facing with Covid-19, but the the way this the way the Office of Management and budget has been handling. The capital budget right now is that is that these projects have not been cut, but they have been, but they, but many of them have been paused. So the money is in the budget, but and we've been allowed to proceed with the design of these projects, but once they reach the stage where we would normally put them out for bids at that point they get paused, and so I mean hopefully by the time we're ready with this project in the next. I do not know, let's say in the next, the nine months or so at some point next year. Hopefully, things will have returned to normal and we'll be back on the on our regular timetable, but if we were faced right now with having to put the project out for bid, it probably would be on pause, so the shows the timetable or how we've been progressing. With this presentation, we originally had an input, a community input meeting in February of this year, where we first solicited suggestions from the community pam was there and participated in that session, and then we came back to you in September. With the original proposed design, we received more feedback from the community subsequent to that meeting at the end of September, actually originally in September, you guys just supported that design, but then people in the community came back to you and to us with additional feedback. We then had a a fuller discussion at your October meeting and now we're back in November all right. So now I'm going to pass it on to our architect our landscape, architect, for this project, Benjamin Nicolosi, he will be backed up by our deputy design director for Manhattan John earnsberger, our red. Our design director is also on this call of Leslie peoples and either one of them may jump in at some point and provide some additional info for the presentation, but Benjamin take it away thanks Steve, so yeah as Steve mentioned, my name is Benjamin Nicolosiendo Landscape architect with New York City parks I presented to you last month and, as Steve mentioned I'll, give you a brief recap of our last community board meeting and how we addressed your comments holistically. So to remind those who have not attended the last few meetings back in February, we did have the scope meeting to discuss which areas of the park everyone would like to see reconstructed and we have a limited budget unfortunately, and can not address all the areas of same far in so at that meeting. At the end of that meeting, the playground was chosen as the area of greatest interest and these stats that you're seeing are stickers that were placed on the drawing by those in attendance. As many of you know, the park is located at 1St, Avenue and East 35Th Street, the East River, is about a block away, and the entrance to the Midtown tunnel is just to the north and to reorient those who have not attended previous meetings. This is the existing layout of the park, so we have handball and basketball courts to the West along 2Nd Avenue. There's the multi- purpose area that already has plans for the installation of synthetic turf. We previously mentioned this at past meetings and the playground which was chosen I'll show a close- up of that shortly and the two main entrances are along First Avenue and they ramp up into the playground area right beside the garden along First Avenue. So this is the existing playground. There's swings to the north and South I'll show some photographs of that. There's large play equipment, that is in the center of the space. There's an adjacent sunken spray shower right across from the comfort station and preschool and along the north and south edge, is a four foot, steel fence and beyond that, a six foot. Steel fence that separates the park from the sidewalk and the last minor reconstruction of this playground was back in 2002, so there are many trees on site. There's approximately 40 seen here around the playground. These trees provide a lot of shade throughout the site, which is nice and they're, mostly in healthy condition, and their root zones do need to be protected, so most of the trees will remain so we're just showing this slide just to indicate that there is a significant constraint on where certain play features can be placed because of so many existing trees around the playground. These are images of the existing play unit in the center of the playground. The two sets of swings that are currently there, some of which do not meet our current safety regulations, a spray shower that is recessed and not accessible, and the slide shows some of the comments we received at our community input meeting back in February. So some of these comments helped us to develop a design for the playground and after the presentation of the design. Last month, as Steve mentioned, we received additional comments from the community. Some are new, for instance, like a request for deck structures and no bike and scooter track. That's particularly important because the bike track took up a significant amount of space and without the track we are able to address some of the other comments like more play equipment and on October 6th. We received some additional comments at the last community Board meeting and that helped shape the redesign that I'll show you shortly. The primary comments from that meeting were to have less plants in the playground and a preference to keep the existing layout. So before I show you, the new design I'll go through each of the options that we presented at that last meeting and remind those who were not at that meeting what the options were that were chosen. So this was the schematic design that was presented back in September was created to address the community comments back in February and, as you can see, it features a large bike and scooter track and spray shower. At last month's meeting, when we presented options for the bike track, option three was chosen, and this is option. Three: that's at the right and option: three. It was selected to have no track or for bikes and scooters within the playground. So in this scenario it was mentioned that an area for tire swings was preferred tire swings and or play houses. We also discussed swings and option. Three was chosen for an expanded area for swings. These were the options that were presented and at the meeting it was mentioned that additional strap seats for older children were desired instead of an adac and so after some study and with the removal of the track, I'm happy to say that we are able to accommodate that configuration the option. Three that's shown in the lower left, which will offer more swings than you currently have there and I'll show that shortly regarding play equipment, we showed you a design with many climbers, as was originally requested. So this is the rendering that we presented and at last month's meeting it was decided that a hybrid structure that featured decks and roofs and climbing structures was preferred. We also discussed site furniture last month, and it was mentioned that people like the existing picnic tables and we are able to keep them if they are relocated. We can place them just outside of the entrance. This is the existing picnic table on the left and, since this model seems to be preferred over the more sort of modern version that we originally presented back in September, we can use the same model for additional picnic tables within the new design, and this is the schematic design based on the recent community input and our analysis. The area for the design is a little bit less than half an acre. However, I think we really did our best to fit in everything that was asked for, as requested it's very similar, as you can see to the similar to the sorry, the existing layout, that is there now there's a consolidated gated entrance to the playground that makes a safer and more defined space and to the west there's a wider, more visible pathway that leads to the multi- purpose area and there's two entrances that lead up to that to that zone. So, with the new design, you walk into a large welcoming entrance. That's on access right across from the conference station. The larger play area for older children is the focal point when you enter and, as you can see, there's plenty of play opportunities there and it is on grade for easier access and has a variety of play. Features which I'll show you in the following. Slides to the south is an area for picnicking. There are four additional picnic tables, so that makes about a total of eight picnic tables with the existing ones that are just outside of the playground and to the north. There's a geometric spray shower and it has flush spray features to allow it to be a multi- purpose, play space, there's also small sort of stone- like features that can be used as ledges for children's toys. This was in response to a request that was made at the last meeting and above that we have an area for tire swings and the tire swings are in a similar location to where the tire swings are now. However, you'll might notice that we just pushed it to the east. A little bit and just compressed it in order to provide a sort of a more generous play area, two to five play area with a slide. That's just that's just adjacent to the swings, and if you look towards the south, we have another two five play area. It's sort of a cozy area for younger children has a fun playhouse and a lot of opportunities for quiet ground play and to the east is the large area for swings that I showed earlier and that can accommodate four strap seeds for older children, four bucket seats for younger children and an ADA compliant swing, and this is a view of all the play equipment. I just mentioned in the plan. The 5- 12 play equipment features two slides some spinners. You can see off to the right. There there's also plenty of monkey bars and elevated decks and there's also a large structure that provides many fun opportunities for climbing fitness problem. Solving the two to five play equipment features a slide, there's a playhouse, some fun game panels and climbers. This is the play unit. That's just adjacent to the tire swings and here's another view of that two to five play equipment, and this is a intricate little playhouse in the cozier area for smaller children and has a slide, has games for mortar skills and opportunities for solitary play, and this is in a similar location to where the existing playhouse is currently- and these are the tire swings also shown in an area that is similar to where the entire swings exist. Now, and this is our fencing diagram, so you can see there's a new four foot fence that stretches across the entrance and that provides one main entry with a gate and all the proposed fences within the playground are kept below to maintain sight lines. So the only interior fences that are there are placed only whether necessary for like safety as in the areas for the swings. And then, if you look to the west, there's two new gates that lead to the multi- purpose area and the sort of the x's to the north and south of this diagram. That's the fence that will be removed. So there won't be two outer fences in our proposal and just to know all the gray lines in this diagram are fences that will remain. These are the proposed site furnishings, so a drinking fountain will be placed near the playground entrance. A bottle. Filler will be near the multi- purpose entrance and, as I mentioned previously, we'll use the same style bench and table as what is currently in the park, and a new lamppost will be placed in a few locations to make sure the space is more evenly lit. The materials for the ground are fairly neutral to allow the colorful play equipment to really make a big impact and the bright colors sort of reflect. The nearby contacts, the gold of the dome from saint Fartin and November to the east, we'll be placing shade, tolerant and native plants were appropriate on site and new trees and plantings will be kept to the perimeter of the playground as requested and once more, the schematic plan, which I can remain on for comments and questions. Thank you. Thank you. Does anyone have any questions pam? This is Kevin. We do have one at least one outstanding question from David Saul Question is: has there been any conclusion on whether the garden on First Avenue will be accessible to the public yeah? You know the that's the question that we're that's still under consideration here in our office at the borough commissioner's office and I'm going to be I'll have to get back to the committee maybe next month, but this is under active discussion, so I do not have anything to report tonight. Okay, let's move on to Erica Rand Silverman, who asks? Can we see the equipment again? Sure? Let me go to that slide. All the equipment, or is this a specific type erica also asks? Can they show a rendering equipment for the water spray area? That's a certain. We do not have a rendering for that area. We had a very compressed time to redesign the whole site, so unfortunately we do not have a rendering of that area, so the last design took sort of several months to compile. So we had more time to provide renderings, but thank you. Eric is asking about the playground equipment specifically at this point. Okay, let me just I'll just scroll through all the renderings and just as a note, she specifically asking to see the equipment for the older kids. These are the units for the older children 5 to 12. all right, we'll go into some detail explaining the various features, because this is a very elaborate piece of equipment yeah. It is. It provides a lot more climbing opportunities than what's currently there. It's much more dynamic. There's plenty of different types of monkey bars, there's also various nest structures throughout the the 5 to 12 area. Some that latch on to the decks there's also two slides one which is sort of a tunnel slide which is kind of fun and interesting. It's not something that is currently there. There's also a kind of a curved swirl swirled slide that you can see in this. In this image you kind of see where my mouse is roaming and here's a another view of the equipment, and you can see, there's also a opportunity for a sort of rock climbing wall on this side as well, and there's also plenty of panels for games and other type of problem. Solving skills that are sort of throughout the play, equipment and explain what the piece is on the left side yeah. So that's a that's a large neck climber and, as you can see, it's sort of a cylindrical shape here yeah. So I mean this is a really nice piece of equipment because lots of children can be on this at the same time and it also links to the other the sort of larger feature with the various decks at different heights, and it's linked. So you could kind of go from one side to the other by sort of climbing along these nets and hopping along. So it's I think it's a really good integrated design and offers player opportunities like I said that do not currently exist with the play equipment that is there. Okay, we have multiple questions about the water area, but I think it's been established that we do not can not show that we can describe to you the aspects of it. If there's questions about it, we do not have renderings due to the time constraints, but we might be able to answer yeah. Why do not we at least describe what it? What we have in mind there? So the play feat? The spray shower, as I mentioned earlier, is going to have all flush spray features, so that means they'll there'll, be nothing extending from the ground plane. So that makes it a kind of more active space that could be used to have a multi- purpose use, which was something that was requested at the earlier meeting, and then there was a request also to have ledges. We normally do not do kind of seat walls, because it attracts skateboarders and could pose some conflicts for children playing at the spray shower. So instead we order we design these kind of organic geometric shapes that could function as ledges and they could have varying heights and they would be within the the Spray Shower area and the spray features themselves, there's some that are gentler for younger children and some that have a little bit greater pressure and more range for older children. Okay, great, let's say a couple more questions. Kyoko is asking it's actually more of a comment than a question. The comment is, we definitely need ring type monkey bars. Those are the ones kids love the most. We currently have two of those one higher and one lower height. So that is a comment. Kyoko also has a previous question: can we see the play equipment for big kids? I think we did that, and she says I would like to see the monkey bars closely and again asking both of the ring type monkey bars. Maybe we could just keep that up on the or put that up on the screen, so we can see that on the monkey bars edna ness asks. How long is this project expected to take and if Covid-19 remains for next year, maybe better use for it for people in need of help? Well, I think, as I tried to explain earlier, it's very difficult right now to to give you a a real timetable for this project, because we do not know whether it'll how it might be affected by Covid-19 by the copic 19 crisis. So in the best scenario, if we're allowed to proceed without pausing the project, it would not go under construction until probably early 20:22.. So it did, the playground would remain open next year, thanks Steve, we also from ediness. We have a question how many staff members are going to be employed there once it does open. Well again, that depends upon our budget at the time which you know like. I can't predict right now, but you know it. I could not tell you, okay, I think we're winding down on questions here, question actually from Eric. Can I just respond on the monkey bars really quick. I'd just like to point out. There are three different kinds of monkey bars within this view, so you can see and well at least I could see in the previously. There were three and this one. I see two different kinds. Now it's right that we do not have the rings. I would have to get back with the manufacturer to see if those are currently available for the co to comply with code, I'm sure they can make anything, but if they comply with the current codes, we might be able to change one out if they do. If they're, if they can't be done just due to safety, then we can't do it, but anyway we got three different kinds. In this view. Thank you. Erica's question is that a metal slide that would get hot? No, the all the metal slides are facing north, so they do not face the sun which allows them to stay cool, so it should not be plus. The area is covered in trees, as I've shown in the previous slide. There's about 40 trees and the majority of the playground is in shade. Okay, Courtney Nathanson. Can the features in the spray Shower area also be used without the water as previously discussed? Yes, absolutely. The intent here is to enable the people to use the spray Shower Area Year round, which which we had been asked to do. So. That's why the this the spray is going to come up directly from the ground, not from any structures that protrude from the ground, so it'll be a flat, be a flat surface that can be used. You know you know when the when the in the other months beyond the summer, it can be used for kids to just run around in that area. Right, yeah and the surface could also be used if they have chalk if they want to make drawings. There's a nice colored concrete surface that could accommodate that as well. Okay, follow- up question from Courtney. Is it more of an open space? We had talked about tunnels, for example? Are we talking now about? Well, we was talking about the tunnel with respect to the slide which we have now provided, but I'm not sure what the question is is geared is aimed at courtney. You can certainly comment back. Courtney also asked: is it possible to split the new picnic tables to make two separate areas of two tables rather than one area of four tables? We have very limited space so because of space constraints, that's just not possible if we want to be able to provide lots of different play equipment for five to twelve and two to five entire swings, and, as I mentioned previously, because of the various tree constraints, that's the one area that where we could place a cluster of tables, whether it be two or four also I'll just add, you do have still two existing areas of two tables each. So you have two areas of two tables and then one area of four tables yeah right on the other side of the fence. On the east side of the playground, there are two areas each as John mentioned, each of which will have two tables: okay, thanks, Steven John. I think we were told at the last meeting that there was a desire to have an area where people could have maybe birthday parties- or you know you know, small events which would require. You know you know a few tables, so you know we thought we were satisfying. That request. That's correct, yeah and I'll also mention that, just that these tables are accessible on one side, they're kind of sort of cantilevered, so on the north side of these tables is the accessible area, so for say, someone in a wheelchair they'd be able to sit at those tables. Okay, circling back to the Tunnel Discussion Courtney does mentioned that the reference was to the water area. It says we had showed pictures of other parks that had actual structures in the water area. That kids could use without water, not just open space, and I believe that has I mean it is. It is so it is. It conflicts a little bit with what with what we heard at the last meeting, which was to have an open, multi- purpose space, and we also had a few comments saying that from some community members who did not want any high structures within the spray shower area. So we were responding to that we're. We are also providing the ex like extruded Boulder, like shapes, which offer a different kind of play. So that's the kind of thing we've offered in that category. Okay, it's a question for courtney: will you need a permit to reserve the tables, obviously referring to post Covid-19? Well, I do not think I do not think that's something that we had planned to do. They probably would be on a first come first serve basis. I do not Kevin, I think, you're muted. I just moved it out. Sorry, viewed it out, Andrea Levitt asks. Will there be a new gate to the playground? Yes, there will be a double gate right at the entrance right across from the comfort station Okay Emily Breitbart. When will the turf be put in most likely in the we're talking now about the multi- purpose play area? I assume we're anticipating it we'll go in at some point during the spring. Okay- and this appears to be the last question it's from emily as well. What will happen there? It goes. I think we answered it, it's about what happens to the steps in the water area yeah, but the steps are gone. This scenario in order to make a larger area for play, equipment to provide more play activities and also the steps were not accessible. The spray shower so, and we received lots of comments about having to remove the steps because they were a safety concern. So now it's just flash it's easily accessible, no more questions, but another request to show the house area that the little kids now use. What thank you. This looks like a duplex tremendous pam. That's all the questions looks like we have from the public okay. So I have a question to the committee. Are you in agreement that you approve of this, because I know that Steve is going to need a resolution? I believe is that correct Steve? That is correct? Okay, so let me just say: ask one little side question: are you zooming? I are you getting off this thing after we're finished with this, because I have a question about a couple other areas that you would be very helpful with. Well, I could I could stay on a little longer, but I have another community board meeting that I also have to join. Okay, I'll talk fast, okay, so so are we in agreement about this playground and if we are, can we have a show of hands or cody? Do you want to ask what the deal is here? I'm happy to do a roll call, but someone needs to I'll be happy to present a resolution of no objection for this plan. I do feel like there is one more question I may have looked at before, and I do want to make sure that the public certainly has answered questions before we do vote or before this is seconded. Can kids climb the bouldering structure in the water area? There's a question: yes, okay! Thank you. I think we're looking for a second okay, Anton good, okay, so committee members said please unmute yourself when I call your name and declare in favor against abstain or not entitled on this motion for a resolution on this proposed redesign. Pam, Vassell Enthusiastic. Yes, all right, Kevin, O'keefe passionately, yes, Martin Barrett, yes, Matt, Bondi, Matt Bondi! I'm sorry! I said yes. Can you hear me? Yes, Genie Dinaffria, yes, right, Anton, Mallner, yes, Raj Nair has not joined Patel. Yes, Sean Sherman has joined sean, yes right, Mark Thompson! Yes, I do not see that Ronnie is joined, okay or Gary Dean Stephanie's. Yes, all right! That's ten in favor, no against no extensions, that's great! So Ronnie was going to write the resolution, so I'm assuming Kevin that you'll speak to Ronnie and you know, fill in all the details. I'd be happy to okay. Thank you. So so that will conclude this part of our agenda. But there were a couple of questions that came up and I want to make sure that it's addressed on a larger area, because I'm not sure that Erica you were going to send this out. So the first thing was: oh, no wait! This is something different, I'm sorry, the friends, the friends of Albano Jr. Playground, would like to get process updates on Bellevue, South, Park procurement and construction, progress Steve! That's for you! I think yes, so Bellevue South is one of those projects which is on pause. As I described earlier, it's went through the entire design process. That's another example of where we revised our design to satisfy the community's concerns and we went back to the community board a couple of additional times and we came up with a with a with a design that I think everybody ended up embracing. So we completed that design process. The construction documents were then completed. They were then reviewed by two levels of lawyers went through legal review, which is necessary before we put projects out for bid, and at that point, as with many of our other projects, it's been put on pause, so we're waiting for the green light to be able to put that project out for bid it's ready to go, but unfortunately it's been, it's been quality before we can go further. Okay, I have another question the MTA. We understand that the MTA has declined the request to allow the renovation of Albano Jr. Playground playground. Is that correct? We would like it okay, so they want an update on the use of the 800,000 that was allocated to that renovation, which was given by rosie mendes. Yes, well I'd like to talk about that maybe next month, because we are, we are discussing this matter with the council member Rivera, so I do not know at the moment what what you know. We have not completely given up hope of proceeding with the project. So I think it's premature right now to talk about moving the money, but, but maybe we can discuss that next month. Okay, that would be great because I know they're very concerned that the that rosie had given the money for the park and they'd like to see that it remains in the district so and we agree but- and it's a very disappointing, very disa- we're very disappointed that the that the MTA is not allowed us to proceed with that project. But let's discuss it next month. Okay, so Kevin, you can put it on your agenda. So did you answer something about the comfort station? Did I just miss that? Well, not the conversation, we the land, the space around the garden area right well again. What I said in that case is that we're discussing that question right here in the borough commissioner's office, and we recognize that there's a there are requests that it be opened up. So again, I'd I'll hopefully be in a better position to discuss that next month, okay and Steve just a couple a couple of things: the at Glitter park, there's that space, where it's not exactly a sinkhole but something in the in the structure of how it fits over the water. You know what I'm talking about. Can I can anyone say it better? I think West has been looking into that. So maybe Wes can address that question. Okay, that would be great and I think there's also. There are some problems like with the Waterfront area near the 34Th Street Heliport. Maybe West knows about that as well. The 34Th Street heliport is not our property, so, but maybe that may be a question for I assume it's EDC that maybe handles that property. Pam, you've, muted yourself, I did my dog started barking. I have one question I saw in the rendering that there was a something called DOT lighting. Is that a foundry that you use Steve, D-, O- T? Oh D-, O- T? Oh god, all right, so is that a special foundry that you use? No, the lighting that we install in our parks is maintained by D.O.T, okay, absolutely and so, except in unusual circumstances. We only put in lighting which meets D.O.T standards, which they'll be able to maintain. Okay, great. Thank you. We do not change the lights ourselves. No, fooling! Okay! Thank you so much for giving my stupidity. It was just in lower case D.O.T, so I thought maybe it was yeah. No, it's my fault. No, it's all full! Okay, like you are blameless. All right! I have to get. Are you done with me? Yes, sadly, yes all right! Well, I want to thank you for working so cooperatively with us over the last couple of years, and I regret that you're moving on, but I assume we're going to have a similarly good relationship with Kevin. I believe that to be true and steve, you and your team have been really stupendous about this issue. I'm so grateful, as is the whole committee. Thank you so much. I found it so hard to say no to you so so we agreed to revise our plans so very good. I'm glad we've come up with an amicable solution. Thank you all. Thank you to the members of this committee. Thank you. Thank you good night, okay, so now I believe, can I can I just say Kevin. You can feel free to pick up the phone and call me whenever you wish. Thank you Steve. I greatly appreciate it and I will certainly take you up on it. Thank you same with me all right. Take care. Thank you, okay, so I think we're going to move on to the next. The next item agenda, which is Wes so Wes. You want to give us a little show and tell with what's going on, and maybe you can address some of those issues that I just brought up a minute ago. Sure can you hear me did mute myself we here. Can everybody hear me tonight. Well, hi everyone, I'm Wes, I'm the park manager and I just have some brief updates I'll try to maybe I'll start off with the glitch question, which is it's actually not a sinkhole, but it is an area where the you may not know it, but that area is actually built upon piers, so the entire glick area is actually a pier area. There's stilts, underneath the walking surfaces there at glick, so EDC engineers and the parks engineers surveyed underneath and there's a few peers that they are concerned with the structurally being. You know strong enough to support additional weight. They do not feel like it's going to collapse right away. However, it feels best that we close it off that particular section until repairs can be made, I'm sorry to interrupt, but are you closing it off with that yellow tape like the crime tape? Or are you going to do something? That's more substantial, because that tape is kind of a joke right now, we've we're using french barricades. That's all we have at the time for right now and we've actually tried to wire tie them together. There's fitness equipment in there and definitely during Covid-19, we've seen a major uptick use of our parks, especially for fitness. So you know people are disrespecting the french barricades, even though we've got them wired with wire they'll cut, it they'll cut them, but we constantly try to wire that up. We are looking into better fencing, but we're looking at that more on a grand scale throughout the entire esplanade area and we are putting out to bid for an emergency contracting fence. I can't answer where we're at with that. All I can say is we put it out the bid we've requested that area be encompassed within the emergency contracting fence that we're putting out to bid I'm calling it contractor offense just for a lack of better terms, but basically we're looking at renting what we call panel cyclone, fencing or something with that would be eight foot high and either mounted into the ground or used with like a Jersey barrier or something. So we are definitely looking into a better way of securing that area until work can be developed that click, but it's currently out the bid and we'll have to see what bids we get to come back and I'm not involved in that process. But I'm telling you that's where we're at with it so well. Where is that on the paws list? Is it on the bottom of the pause list, or is it at the top because it's kind of an emergency for fence for the fencing it's out to bid so we're it's? The fencing area is not paused. That's just we're waiting to get bids back and you know typically, what happens with their bids is most people know we have an idea of what we expect to get it bidded on, but not always are our expectations met. Sometimes they come in too high. So if it was to come in over what we expected, then that could be a different process. It might go back out to bid. It could be pause, but generally speaking that, because it's like emergency fencing, I doubt it would be paused, but we would want it to come in within a certain price range. So, but at this point in time, I'm not even aware of what bids we've got. So I'm not in that level. I'm just know that we have proposed it to be put out the bid for a an altered, alternate fencing or something taller, fencing, and just specifically in that one area that we're concerned with until the entire park goes under construction, but the entire park may be a little while, as you see the design process, we're still in the design process, and then it's got to go on the bid and, as we know, with Covid-19, that could be quite some time before the that area is repaired. But the funding is there for the repairs, with the cost of you know in the in the design phase. Should it go? You know once it goes forward, hopefully that answers some of that questions. Not you know as best we can, but we are looking at better fencing. We have supervision, checking the fence in regularly until we get the better fencing and making sure we try to secure it, but there's obviously more people damaging it than I can get people to repair it in some cases. But we do check it regularly. If anybody sees it not being secured properly reach out to me and I'll, send my cruise back over and try to repair it again, but we are looking and we recognize. We need better fencing and we have put out a request for that and got it out to bid. So if there's no more questions, we click I'm going to move on, and you know we just had Steve. So I'm going to Steve is our capital guy, so anything with capital, I'm going to kind of just put off to Steve, and so I'm going to go back on to what we had where I mean I'd like to say that we had currently right now, we're still only permitting small events such as birthday parties, we're not doing any permits that could draw in any large crowds, but we are authorizing small birthday parties. We are authorizing you, youth, sports and and first amendment type permits. So you know you may have seen some free speech or you may see some manures or you could even see a Christmas tree, but we would not be doing. As far as I know, we have not done anything like any Christmas, Tree, Lighting or any you know singing or anything that would draw in people, but we are allowing menorahs or possibly a Christmas tree or anything that would be considered religious. We're permitting I'd like to mention that we had several successful. It's my park day volunteer events last at the at the end of October glick and the areas near there were also participants in that and we'd like to thank everyone who participated in the clique and Stuyvesant bellevue, south and Albano Jr. Playground, just to name a few. I hope I'm not leaving any out, or there was some more as well at Macarthur and several other parks throughout the district. So, as I mentioned earlier too, the whole volunteer project. Undercover. You know we're trying to learn it we're starting off small. We did a little bit more this time for it's my park day. We always trying to keep them small, but we had, I would say it was very successful and there was a fair amount of work to put together. So we thank everyone involved with their Ashley Knuckley, our volunteer coordinator and everyone who came out and worked. We really can't thank you enough, so we're really very dependent upon the volunteer groups and we're happy to try to move forward in that area, also at Albano Jr. Playground that came up earlier as well, but we did have a volunteer project there and our commissioner deputy commissioner was there Liam Kavanagh and some discussions was made there and we're going to be installing three new benches at that site, so that pro that'll be moving forward within the next couple weeks, mostly on the east side, we're going to put two on the east side and one on the northeast side kind of near the playground. If you're familiar with that park, so that'll be a nice addition to the park. Robano I'd also like to mention that our shops plumbers basically rented a. We call them a sock truck, but it's basically a large vacuum truck. You may have seen them very large trucks and we cleaned out some of our clogged storm drains. So, for instance, at Peters field we've had many complaints from the school. There was a clogged drain and we would clean it out some and it would slow drain and it would work, but it was always problematic. It was filled with dirt, so our plumbers came in. They got a truck. We basically rented a truck and went in with our plumbers and cleaned out the whole catch basin. We did that at not just Peter's field, but that was also done at St, bartons and also Robert Moses, so three locations of some trains that have been a problem, I'm happy to say that those issues have been resolved. Trying to see. I think that's most of the information that I got. Thank you. Do we have anything one other thing I'd like to add: the borough did hire an additional exterminator, so we are treating our parks regularly with we hope to increase the amount of baiting that we do at our sites as well, so hope we hope that helps a lot in the area as well. So with that being said, any questions for me and I have a question sure hi wes. Thanks for the update, I was hoping you could update us on the status of the you may have called it cyclone fencing earlier today, but it's basically rental fencing chain link, fencing, that's at 55th and 50, actually 56th and 57th street. The brand new park that connects to 57th street and the 56Th Street Sutton place parks. Yes, I'm glad you mentioned that I'm sorry. I did have that on my list and I skipped over it. I have everything written out and it's very scatter Brained I apologize, but so we call that was Sutton 54th and that is part of the EDC project. You know part of the espionage phase, certain phase that's going to be connecting 54th street you're, basically building going to go out over the water and build a bridge that ties into the espionage there at 60th street. So the entrance to that area is going to be there at East, 54Th Street. Now that project is being carried out by EDC, which is another group of the city. It's not necessarily parks Department. It is a city agency, so that fencing is done by their contractors and it's just put up temporarily while they're doing the work in that area. But that's why that's what I'm talking about yeah? I was talking about the ones a block or two north, because I saw that yeah they've totally closed off Clara Coffee park down there on 54th for the next year. I think it is but there's one there's 50 there's 54th is 55th is 56- 57 and you may recall that recently they finished a great project that connected the 56th and 57th street parks 57. Yes, we still have we've always had the cyclone fencing there. That is a that is an issue. That is, how can I say, part of the property was originally was. It was the condominiums property and we actually sued them to. It was originally parks Department. So with that, basically, the judge says: okay, here's how we're going to settle this park. With that being said, the condominium wants large day one right, iron, fencing and they're actually going to be installing the fencing and that's an agreement through the court. So currently right now they have not installed that fencing. So that's why we have cycling fencing at that site. That was the cyclone fencing left over from the construction project that parks did and the condominium is on the hook for the finished wrought iron fencing. I do not have any updates on where they're at with that and be honest I'll, try to follow up with it, but that part of the project for Sutton, 56 and 57 was not going to be completed by the Parks Department, and that was determined by the legal agreement when it was originally established. All right. Well, if you could just you know, follow up on and let us know because it's been there for a long time and the park has been complete for a very long time. Granted the paws put a pause on the building's construction of their backyard. Part of the deal was that they would get. It will keep a portion of their backyard there between 56th and 57th street, so that was delayed, and maybe that has something to do with it. But if you could just find out- and let me know because it would seem that the big fencing is there already and unless they plan on putting equally tall fencing at 57th street, which had never historically been there in the past and was not necessary when it was just the 57th street seven place park, then it would seem that since the fence is already up around the entirety of their property, it should probably come down. You know the cyclone, fencing or the temporary fencing because it is unsightly and what they serve to do with. It is also foreclose the use of some benches on 57th street at the end of the Cul- de- sac that people would enjoy sitting on because when they close those fences off at night, which will now be at six o'clock at night throughout the winter, people can't sit there on those benches which they used to like to do so. If you could just find out- and let us know that would be great, I would appreciate it. You look at the backyard where, once sudden places they put a roid iron fence that divides their backyard to the park, and I think they're going to continue that across where that chain link fences. So one something is paying for all that. Also, the ability to secure the park at night was also part of the agreement that they had with that as well, which is why they're responsible for the fencing you know it was at the parks. We probably leave it open all the time, but you know for security reasons. They do not want that. So it was part of the agreement, but I'll look into it and find out what I can find out. Well. Thank you. Thank you very much, that's great okay, so I want to apologize because I know we're supposed to follow the agenda and I completely skipped over this sandy. Can you give us an update on the street application for East 36Th street between the Tunnel Approach, Street and First Avenue hello? We've made the application and we noted that we do have a lot of community support. I think at this point, though, we need some letters from the from the people who did support it. I understand some of those people may still be on the call, and we might we really should reach out to them to try and give more support a letter, something to encourage them to actually go through with this application. One of the concerns is that it is used by an NYPD by the NYPD as a staging area, so we would really need to get some push, or some support, probably from our elected officials, to make sure that space could be used. It's also used as a storage area for the water tunnel work, but my understanding is that will be finished very soon and it probably could go back into being. We might be able to move the NYPD to the north side of the street and use the south side of the street as a play street an additional area. So, unfortunately, there is no real movement on the application. I think it's up to us to do a little bit more negotiating and pursuing this with our elected officials. Kevin. Can you reach out to the people from the PTA and that committee that was on the call and see if they can get themselves together? Perhaps a petition would be helpful and you know whatever it takes to get some movement, and perhaps a meeting with the elected officials would be very helpful I'll be happy to. I did hear from molly that I think they already is this right sandy that they put in an application, the PTA and they were rejected. Not to my knowledge, oh kb, put in an application and has not heard back. Maybe it was not heard back. I thought it was just they had passed. It has not been rejected, okay great to hear so. We still have the opportunity to push wonderful good. I might recommend. Maybe we have a walk through. That would be good and a better understanding. I know that fresh direct has sort of claimed some of that real estate. So we need to work that out clearly right. There were several delivery trucks. The last time I was there right, but are they just squatting or did they get permission formally from somebody to park? No, they never get permission space, yeah, okay, so Kevin. I leave it to you to follow through on that, and I want to thank you so much sandy. I appreciate it. I'm sorry you had to stay on the call a little bit longer. It's my mistake in my bad eyes. Sorry, no problem! I we appreciate any support that we can get from some of the other. You know the other people who helped us sign on to the application, so we go to them as well. It would be beneficial to them because it would give extra space, which would be wonderful- and I know one of the concerns from the PTA groups was that they would still like to have some bike riding area and they were the new plans that does not have any place to ride a bike, so that will be road space that could possibly be used for that purpose. Okay, so moving on, thank you Sandy. So moving on to the next thing, which is the chairs report, I do not have much of a report because in two minutes I'm not going to be the chair, but I I wanted very much to thank all of you and to tell you how incredible, as a committee that you've been and you've done, great work- and I really appreciate it- and I appreciate that mark was so willing to be so helpful and turn it over to me when, when he left the committee- and I'm happy to tell all of you- probably read it today in the newsletter in the Wednesday newsletter. But Kevin is the new chair and Jeannie will be the vice chair and so they're. Very capable and wonderful people, and it should all be just perfect, and so I want to thank you for all your help, and I appreciate everything that you've done and I do not know what else to say. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you and complete with mark thanks. We love you pam. Thank you for everything. Thank you so much, and so do we have any old business that anyone wants to raise. Okay, that being said that we do not have any. Does someone want to make a motion to adjourn per second? Okay, that's great! So now we're adjourned, seeing that there are no objections and once again thank you so much and see you in the funny papers.
