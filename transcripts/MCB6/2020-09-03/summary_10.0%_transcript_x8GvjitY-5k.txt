By raising your hand through zoom chat should only be used to alert us to any technical difficulties you're having or to state and writing information like an email address that was already stated aloud on the on the record during the meeting and when the working group member is given the floor to speak, I'll, identify you and you can unmute yourself so that you can speak.
You know we were moving ahead with the approvals on the property on 13th street to get that going and we were going to start building on 13th street We had not yet come to a concrete plan of what we were going to do with the property, so the pandemic hits and obviously everything gets put on hold We continue to still be on hold because right now we have to be prepared for a possible second wave And, we're required by the governor to have plans to go to a 50 percent up to a hundred percent surge, and some of that's been done by using you know, space at the petri division.
The only thing I will say in the only project that has moved forward Is. We are moving ahead with the rivington street project and we have started to do some interior demolition and construction for that project, which will eventually lead to the emptying of the bernstein building at 910 nathan d perlman place, but even that we've made no disposition, no thought of what we're doing with that property.
The timeline at the earliest is push back more than six months, because we're talking six months right, now, you know by time 13Th will have been six months, done, we're not even close to moving forward on any of the stuff on 13th, street.
I know you don't have a lot of new things to tell us, but any idea when you would be meeting on all of that again or are you just waiting for the word from the governor in terms of when I would say right, now, given the fact that we are, we are surge planning for the potential for the fall,?
So I may be able to tell you, sometime later this month, at least what we're thinking about, but right, now, clearly, everything is on hold with the timeline of everything of the construction being pushed back a minimum of six months, because obviously this is new york.
If there's questions from any of the other working group, members for brad you've got a hand from sandy and jim I, and I was just wondering if the project does move ahead, more quickly.
You, know, I think, what I reported, or we reported the last time, is the real estate committee was kind of sitting down and trying to figure all this out, Yet, and obviously, as I said, I I'm, not a real estate expert, but the real estate market in new york city has clearly changed due to this pandemic.
Given all that I know, we haven't met formally as a full working group over the summer, but some of a few of us have been meeting and reviewing and kind of working on a website, and we can show the whole committee You guys, are interested in seeing what, where we are with that wells had been working on it corrine and sandy and letty were all very instrumental in putting it together.
I, don't know sandy if your mentee was still interested in that or had more knowledge about working in wordpress, but she's still,, the idea being to have a kind of catchy easy name to communicate with the neighborhood, especially so when we reach out to them instead of thinking.
So we're okay to go ahead and reach out to those to friends school, and what have you This is the this would be the who we are page linked from the top nav navigation bar and letty drew a lot of the copy, I think from kind of the about cb6 page on her current site , It talks about the fourth coming sale, listing that it's going to happen in 2023 what they need to potentially get out of it, and then it talks a little bit about the relocation to rivington street, and on that page I think we're going to kind of maybe tweak the language that says it's the largest real estate, sale.
We heard this and like just a running kind of timeline, We can, you know hopefully get people on this mailing list and they'll be copied on the site, whether they're, a community group or local officials or whoever we want to have kind of in the loop on this.
