You know we were moving ahead with the approvals on the property on 13th street to get that going and we were going to start building on 13th street So the pandemic hits and obviously everything gets put on hold and we continue to still be on hold because right now we have to be prepared for a possible second wave and we're required by the governor to have plans to go to a 50 percent up to a hundred percent surge, and some of that's been done by using you know, space at the petri division , We haven't had even had a real estate people meeting to discuss it.
In addition to it is we're going to have primary care for the people who use those types of services and some more enhanced services that we could not fit into the bernstein building We've been approached by the 14th street, we're not doing anything with anything right now, just in case the second wave turns out to be really bad Oh, it's not in the process of being emptied out, but the services that are in the bernstein building the construction for the new facility have very preliminarily, started, we're still years away from that finishing as well, but that's the only project of our what we originally talked about for what was going on the super block and that's the only project.
That I can't imagine that the real estate committee and the real estate group are sitting there anytime before you know middle to end of october, when we see what's going on, I know that the borough president's working group, which you guys are parts of you are associated with that You know in and around the jewish holidays in september, I'm assuming and we may be able to give you at least a little more update of what our thinking is and where we're at that point So I may be able to tell you, sometime later this month, at least what we're thinking about, but right now, clearly, everything is on hold with the timeline of everything of the construction being pushed back a minimum of six months, because obviously this is new york.
When everything gets completed again, that's you know we have people who were just starting You , know, I think what I reported, or we reported the last time is the real estate committee was kind of sitting down and trying to figure all this out, Yet and obviously, as I said, I I'm, not a real estate expert, but the real estate market in new york city has clearly changed due to this pandemic How that affects pricing and how that affects how you market it may be changed as well, but I think that, sometime later in the month, or as we get more into october, we may have a better idea of being able to update you on that.
We have your contact information, correct, yeah, You know using the assumptions that we had before the pandemic hit with some, like you know, kind of clauses in there about We, don't know exactly what's going to happen at this point, given all that I know, we haven't met formally as a full working group over the summer, but some of a few of us have been meeting and reviewing and kind of working on a website, and we can show the whole committee Basically I'm, pulling it up in our cb6 website, which is also a wordpress site.
At this point, Jim we may enlist you or someone else This is a cb6 project, That's going to be in there just asking for community input on what type of services and things they'd like to see happen there So, and then we have a kind of contact list We took some photos of the area we have on the site where people can kind of orient themselves.
