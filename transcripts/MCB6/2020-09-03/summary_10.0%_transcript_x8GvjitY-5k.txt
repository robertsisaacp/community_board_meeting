By raising your hand, through zoom chat should only be used to alert us to any technical difficulties you're having or to state and writing information like an email address that was already stated aloud on the on the record during the meeting and when the working group member is given the floor to speak, I'll, identify you and you can unmute yourself so that you can speak.
You know we were moving ahead with the approvals on the property on 13th street to get that going and we were going to start building on 13th street We're still years down the road away from you, know, finalizing what you know, everything as we move forward We had not yet come to a concrete plan of what we were going to do with the property, so the pandemic hits and obviously everything gets put on hold We continue to still be on hold because right now we have to be prepared for a possible second wave And, we're required by the governor to have plans to go to a 50 percent up to a hundred percent surge, and some of that's been done by using you know, space at the Petri division.
The only thing I will say in the only project that has moved forward Is. We are moving ahead with the Rivington Street project and we have started to do some interior demolition and construction for that project, which will eventually lead to the emptying of the Bernstein building.
Oh, it's not in the process of being emptied out, but the services that are in the Bernstein building the construction for the new facility have very preliminarily, started, we're still years away from that finishing as well, but that's the only project of our what we originally talked about for what was going on the super block and That campus.
I mean it sounds like you're, essentially in kind of a holding pattern until we know what's happening with the pandemic, anything else , So timeline possibly is pushed out based on all of that.
I know you do not have a lot of new things to tell us, but any idea when you would be meeting on all of that again or are you just waiting for the word from the governor in terms of when I would say right, now, given the fact that we are, we are surge planning for the potential for the fall?
So I may be able to tell you, sometime later this month, at least what we're thinking about, but right, now, clearly, everything is on hold with the timeline of everything of the construction being pushed back a minimum of six months, because obviously this is New. In addition to the pushed out timeline that we can completely understand at this point.
If there's questions from any of the other working group, members for Brad you've got a hand from Sandy and Jim. And I was just wondering if the project does move ahead.
The only thing I will say is that the only construction that's going on is Bernstein, whether that hastens the sale of that property, possibly, but no decisions have been made, and I know.
You, know, I think, what I reported, or we reported the last time, is the real estate committee was kind of sitting down and trying to figure all this out.
I, think we're okay, so brad after this, we are going to look at some of our ideas about communication around this site.
Given all that I know, we have not met formally as a full working group over the summer, but some of a few of us have been meeting and reviewing and kind of working on a website, and we can show the whole committee You guys, are interested in seeing what, where we are with that wells had been working on it.
I do not know sandy if your mentee was still interested in that or had more knowledge about working in wordpress, but she's still,, the idea being to have a kind of catchy easy name to communicate with the neighborhood, especially so when we reach out to them instead of thinking.
We heard this and like just a running kind of timeline, We can, you know hopefully get people on this mailing list and they'll be copied on the site, whether they're, a community group or local officials or whoever we want to have kind of in the loop on this.
