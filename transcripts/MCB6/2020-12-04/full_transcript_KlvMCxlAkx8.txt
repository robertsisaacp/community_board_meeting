Live streams coming up; okay, I'm going to mute so all right. Okay, all right! So welcome everybody to the December 3rd 2020 meeting of the CB6 strategic Community Planning Committee. Hopefully you guys all got the memo that that's the committee you're in now. My name is Kavitha Matthew, I'm the chair of the committee. This meeting is called to order at 701 pm and tonight. We're joined by assistant, district manager, Cody, Osterman I think we have some members of the public tonight right. So members, okay, great members of the public, you can raise any questions or comments that you have through the Q&A feature of zoom. If there's time following the committee's discussion will field questions from the public and we need a volunteer to take minutes tonight. Well, as I know, you volunteered, but I'm going to look for someone else. I'm looking around the room, I did last month, yeah I, know Sandy or anyone else just done a bunch too, if not Jim you're talking, but I can't hear what you're saying said: I did them in September, I had actually volunteered and then I Cody reminded me that I had done them in September. I'm trying to cover all my committees early in the month early in the new year. I can do it, but I can't take notes during the meeting. So I can do it. If I can do it off the video transcript at the meeting. If you don't mind, that's fine I think yeah I don't mind whatever that's actually the best way to watch it all over again. Okay, I could watch it five times. Oh you know what you do. You cast it to your TV and draft, while you're watching the notes watching the video yeah. Let's not do that I be taking the minutes tonight. Thank you. So much rich and now we'll take attendance by roll call and Cody will conduct the roll call. Okay committee members here, Lucifer. So, okay, thanks Cody, so the agenda for tonight's meeting was distributed ahead of time by the board office and will appear momentarily on the screen before you. Okay, great! Thank you. If there's no objection, we will adopt the agenda. As stated members of the committee. If you object to adopting the agenda, you may raise your hand through zoom, seeing no objections. The agenda for tonight's meeting is adopted now the meetings from the November fifth meeting were distributed ahead of time by the board office as well. If there's no objection, we will adopt my echo, so someone has to mute themselves. Okay, thank you and same goes for this. If you object, you may raise your hand through zoom all right great, seeing no objections also adopted the November 5th minutes are adopted and they will soon be available on the CB6 website. All right now, I'm going to just go through our usual ground rules. I think we have some additional attendees, so I'll run through all of them quickly. No one may speak until granted and, oh sorry, in order to conduct an efficient meeting, let's observe a few ground rules. No one may speak until granted the floor committee members. If you have a question about committee business or wish to make a motion, please raise your hand through zoom, and you guys all know how to do that. The chat function should not be used for committee business. When a committee member is given the floor to speak, I will identify. You can mute yourself so that you can speak and we're required by executive order to create a verbatim transcript of the meeting. So please keep your questions and comments, succinct and Germain to the discussion. All right thanks everybody! So tonight we're really excited to have a presentation by one of our illustrious members Claude who is going to talk about the history of affordable housing and community district 6. This is something that we have been hoping to do: I hope that there's some folks joining from other committees as well to hear all this good information but I think it'll help us in our planning process Claude. Whenever you're ready, you can take it away. Okay, I, don't know who volunteered me, but I'll gladly do this, I'm going to try to keep it as simple as possible, because when you get into affordable housing, it gets confusing, and every television tells you I, don't know what affordable housing is when there are definite definitions for affordable housing at all categories. The first thing we need to do is recognize where our community board is so. We cover 14th street to 59th street Lexington Avenue to the river. That's very significant, going back a few years, because this area used to be a primarily a manufacturing area and what people used to call Tin Pan alley with the hospitals. What then really huh that Pan Alley yeah Bedpan Alley all right, 10 pounds, one of the first developments to come along in our area that was significant, was around 1947, which was starters in town, I'm not going to go into the history of status in town, but I'm just telling you that was one of the first major developments in our area. If you want to go back to that area, then you need to talk to Lou, but from Stuyvesant town we had a number of what we call urban developments, urban renewal projects that went on in this area. Just imagine all of this area as being tenements and the third Avenue on the west running the third Avenue L and all of the rest manufacturing going over to the river. We had. A number of urban developments come in, one was from 23rd street to 30th street seven blocks, and that was the Bellevue South Urban renewal. That's another project that, if you want to know about you asked Lou, not me 29th street 23rd to 29th. Well, they say 30 or so, but that's all right, see I said ass. Lou, you know the north side of 29th. The south side of 30th was left. Okay. Let me finish a little I. Don't want to take too long. Sorry, but anyway, Lou has the drawings. You know the original drawing. So you can ask him about that kind of stuff. Then the other major one that came in was above that which went from 30th street to 33rd street, which was the Nyu Urban Renewal title one, which is where Kipp's Bay Plaza is so that covered three blocks. So just imagine all of this shifting in our community this our community didn't look anything the way it looks now, because all of these are major developments that took place and east of that at one point, Mitchell Llama started building and Waterside Plaza was built, but it was built out on the docks and Richard ravish negotiated a 99-year lease for Waterside Plaza, which he just recently renewed. He extended it ran about 40 some years or so, and he's renewed it to another 99 years. So all of this development was going on now, one another major area, our community, which hasn't been developed yet but is as big as the other ones, is the solo site which is east of all of the other ones that I just mentioned so just think of it as if this was like an open land for grab. So now what happens? You have major developers that want to come in and build do construction, okay, so I'm going to give you example of the people that have built in our community 14th street to 59th street Fisher, Brothers Solo, Jd stern, the toll brothers, Snl Green, Rose, Associates and Tishman Spire. Now those are the ones that are really out for profit, but then you have other developers that are kind of non-profit that have a commitment to doing affordable housing. That's fixed I include one, that's really not in our community, but right next to it, because we are affected by what they did and that is breaking ground. And then you have monodoc who did the micro unit, and you have new Destiny housing, which did one of the first buildings that we call that are built in conjunction with those major builders. What the major builders would do is take any one of those people that I named. They will make a combination and all invest and do the primary mortgaging to do a development and then simultaneously they will build affordable housing, small units adjacent to the bigger units. Those are called those units develop. What we call compensated square footage and one of the first ones that was built in our community, was built at 307 East 54th street. It only had eight apartments in it, four studios and four one bedrooms and it was built for seniors and it was built for a building around the corner. Practically I can't remember the number something like 333 Third Avenue and that's where you get your compensated square footage I'll, go into that in a little detail later and then you have developers that are kind of in the middle. You have the for-profit and you have the non-profit developers, and then you have developers that are right in the middle. That kind of do both and the major one in our community was called Atlantic Development. The founders of that was Peter Fine and let me see what was his name mark Alhine. They developed Atlantic development. They built a lot of that compensated square footage, buildings, kind of buildings and I'll get into that in a minute. Now in our community, we like to think that we don't have. We didn't, have very much affordable housing, but I got news for you. We had tons of affordable housing in our community. We had a huge amount of Mitchell Llama in our community and Mitchell armor I think was first started being built in the 1950s, so we had in our community Phipps Houses Mitchell Llama Cody. Can you show them? The picture. Tips is Cody there yeah one moment: okay Phipps, you see, there's Bellevue South Park. Fifth houses is between first and second avenue, and it runs from like 25th street to like 29th street I. Believe and Phipps ran its time for a long time. In State, Mitchell Llama was by law limited to the amount of profit it could make. It was called limited profit. They could not make more than six percent profit, and so anybody that was in Mitchell Llama at some point was obviously going to get out and after about 25 years, they raised it to a 7.5. But Phipps was built on that Urban Renewal Bellevue, South urban renewal site. That's where Fips went I'm trying to connect it. So you can see where stuff went. Okay after Phipps it was Waterside Plaza, that's off 23rd street. If you can see it on the river that was built to build waterside plaza and it released to get ravaged for one dollar for 99 years, he just renewed that contract with the city, and that was Mitchell Llama for quite a while for about 25 20. Some years it was Mitchell Llama. When Dick Roberts decided that he wanted to get out of Mitchell Llama, he did a pretty hard negotiating with the city, because what he was going to do was he was going to claim that part of waterside was built after 1974 and part of it was built before, and so, if they didn't kind of give him what he wanted. He was going to make the other cart, go straight to market rate and not go to rent stabilization anything prior to 1974. When you go out, it becomes rent stabilized, that's the second metronome site, large site waterside, Fifth Plaza! Then you have a couple of buildings that you would not normally recognize, either having been Mitchell, Llama or being under something a little bit different, but I'll go to the Mitchell Llama one. If you go to 23rd street right on the corner, where the school is the building above the school, that was a Mitchell Llama, Building, Cooper Gramercy, you know all night: that's where the bus stop is. It has the gates around it. That was a Mitchell llama building. We didn't think so, because the people used to come out and hail taxi cabs all the time and they had a doorman. We didn't know that was a Mitchell llama building until they decided to go out of Mitchell long. But that's when we discovered it was a llama. Then you have a couple of unique buildings. I see it on the map. Already, it says in strata, that's 22nd street and 23rd street on Third Avenue, it's a great building, grayish greenish building, and it's right above the vintage thrift shop. Everybody know where the vintage street shop is. That is not a Mitchell llama building, but it was a building that belonged to Mount Sinai, Beth Israel and the president lived in that building. The President of Beth Israel lived in that building. That was a building for their employees, and so that was an affordable rents for the employees of Mount Sinai. And then, if you go down to mount Sinai, Perlman Place and where Perlman Place runs into 15th street, you have the booth houses, it's 318, East, 15th street, that's a classified, building classified h8 means dormitory, but that was a building that was for the workers that worked for a downtown hospital, New York Downtown hospital. Now is this to say: when I came on the board in 2000, all of these houses were opting out of Mitchell Llama or out of the arrangements that they had as dormitories or affordable housing for their employees. That meant that we had a large amount of possible turnover and the question was being raised. Where do these people go and how do we keep them in our community? That was the reason why I came onto the board at the time we did not have a housing committee and I came on the board to focus on that. How did I know about it? I lived in Waterside Plaza when it first opened. So I was aware of the Mitchell Llama circumstances. Now I left out one there's one other major Mitchell Llama that is still Mitchell armor today hasn't opted out, but a lot of its tenants are trying desperately to get out of Mitchell Llama and that's East Midtown plaza. That's where I live right on 23rd street to 25th, Street, Second, Avenue to First Avenue. We take up that Whole Plaza area. The reason why we haven't gone out as quickly as the others is because they were rental, we're our co-op. That means we decide whether we go out. We have to vote to go out. In the other circumstances, the developer or the owner decided to opt out, but in our case we have not been able to get a vote large enough to allow us to go out. So some people want to stay. Some people want to go out and some people want to make a lot of money. If you go out in this community and become a market rate builder, you can imagine what some of those apartments would go for, and it was nothing like when we moved in when we moved from Waterside Plaza to East, Midtown, plaza I think the payment was like five thousand dollars. You couldn't get a doorknob in here now at that rate, but that's what it was when we moved in at that time. It was primary, a lot of housing for dental students right where the dental school is a lot of their students, lived in our northern part of the east, Midtown plaza in the building where I live, which is the duplexes. They had a lot of students living here. Okay, so now you have an overall picture. This was an area which was primarily manufacturing. There were several major urban renewals. Then there was Mitchell Llama that came in and at one point around the year, 2000 a lot of those buildings decided to opt out of Mitchell Armor, so we were losing a large share of what was our affordable housing in this community. Now we did have other things. We had things like Straus, House and 388 east 344, East 28th street, which is not a house not a nature. Building. It's a New York state Building, but New York state abandoned it and so Niger took over running it. So now what happened from 59th street coming down to 14th street developers decided to develop this whole area and they really started north, the north part of our district, and they worked their way down, as you can see now, they're beginning to develop heavily around 33rd, 23rd and now down to 14th street, but they started up in the 50s and they began to work their way down. What did they target? Well? Look at all of the corner: lots as you come down our community look on the corners today. You will see 33rd street being developed on the corners you'll, see 23rd street being developed on the corners. The developers picked all of those corner lots and began to develop them. Now there are a lot of acronyms that go with affordable housing and housing in general, just tons you can get lost in this. A myriad of all of these things, HUD hdc HPD. Then there are all of the statutes which allow the developers to build under 202. Some of the architects will notice. 232,236 202 is a prominent one for us, that's senior housing. So if a developer is going to do senior housing, they're building under the statute, 202, okay, well, what was primary in our area and what I focused on a lot is what we call 421a, there's a companion statue that goes with 421a, which no one ever hardly ever. Cites 420c, which goes right around with 421a 420,420c, is a conglomeration of the developers private, but it must have a major part of it must be a non-profit, 501, c 3 or a charitable organization. They must be, they must represent 50 of that organization, and they must own or lease that property for 30 years. So what kind of building would that be? It could be like the Kenmore. It could be some supportive housing. It could be something that a church might build. Okay and I'm trying to think off the top of my head. Do we have one like that? But anyway, let me go through what 421a was for our community, a developer comes in and they want to build in our community. Now you remember. Our boundaries are 14th street to 59th street. Under 421a there was a geographic, exclusionary area. Gea in Manhattan Gea was from 14th street to 96th street. What did that? Allow a developer to do some of these for-profit developers that we were talking about like solo fishing brothers? What did it allow them to do? It allowed them to build in the south Bronx in Queens in the outer boroughs, affordable, housing and the ratio comes out to be approximately for every one, affordable unit you build in the outer boroughs. You could build four units in our geographic area, geographic exclusion area, but you're not building, affordable housing, you're building, condos and co-ops. So all the affordable housing is being built in the outer boroughs in the south Bronx in Queens. So if I built 25 I built a building of 25 units in the south Bronx, how many condos could I put up on 59th street four times so I could build a building with a hundred units of condos and co-ops in the geogra in that geographic, exclusionary area. So what did I look at when I came on the board? I said I, don't know, I, don't see any affordable housing, where's the affordable housing in our area and then I realized exclusion meant exactly what it meant: exclusion, excluding, affordable housing. So we were getting all of the condos and the co-ops, the south, Bronx and Queens were getting affordable housing. Those were what we call certificates. In those days a developer could buy certificates. Of course they were billing at themselves. They were buying the certificates from themselves, but they could build and they could buy the certificates and that would allow them to build all of those buildings that you now see going up, 2nd, Avenue, okay and where we had those empty lots. And now this is going beyond the urban renewal. Where we had empty lots, gas stations, flea markets, you would see people having those flea markets for four years three years six years those lots belong to developers, they were just leasing it to the flea markets, because under 421a, if you leave the land follow for three years and then you come in and build on top of it, you get a tax rebate and you don't pay taxes on the final structure. You pay taxes, you don't pay taxes on only on the land, not on the land and the building, once you're finished, and you had a window where you didn't have to report the 421a until after the construction is finished. So we had all of this building going on. We were generating a lot of condos and co-ops and no affordable housing. And how do we take a look at that? Well within the 421a law? It requires hearings now, I, don't know if Lou remembers this, but we used to perfunctory just say we disagree with giving the builder the tax abatement. That was our resolution and I said. No, let's have the hearings. Let's have them come in and tell us what they're going to do? Have them come in and tell us what they're building what they're putting in the building or where it's going to go? Do we have any say in it and out of that, a lot of the community boards at that time were taking a closer look at 421a and were raising questions about affordability being in our own communities. If it's in our community, where they did put some in it being spread throughout the building, not just on the first and second floor, not in a particular line, just the H line, not just studios in one bedrooms. This is what we were getting but studios, one bedroom, two bedroom three bedrooms, and so when we changed the 421a law, we incorporated all of those things and we included what we call permanent affordability. That means, when you come in with those units they have to stay designated as affordable and that when somebody moves out, it starts at that rate, but it can only go up like rent stabilization by the rent guideline boards could not go to market rate. That was important. Could not go to market rate had to stay as one stabilization matter of fact. This is why we have some problems. Nowadays is because a lot of the developers didn't register the apartments, and so you know they go in open market. So you have 202 and I'll. Give you an example of 202. I'm trying to do this as fast as I can as much as I can remember. You have 202, which is senior housing. I'll, give you a prime example and I guess a lot of you may know it. It's Cabrini House on 19th street, that's senior housing built under the statue of 202. That was a major thing for us to get that built and the day that we opened it. We had a waiting list. It was filled to capacity. Then you had this Kenmore, which was a dilapidated hotel and private entities came in and renovated it. They didn't make it completely affordable. So it was partly hotel and partly living quarters, but it came under New York state, which is called supportive housing, and that is what we call New York one New York two and now present day. New York three: that's the state structure for doing a supportive housing and you'll find a lot of people like breaking ground and those other groups doing that kind of housing. It provides services for whoever lives in those buildings. Breaking ground has a major one. That's right! Next to us, it's called the Prince George, many of you that probably know the Prince George. That's the major construction, but they're getting ready to do another one they're getting ready to do a major one of the breaking ground. Then there's section eight and the only thing I'll say about section: eight is there are some cases where section eight doesn't just go with the tenant. There are section 8 project based buildings. We have one in our community, that's the Renwick I believe that's on like 29th street, and they can be section 8 for they just renewed about maybe five years ago or 10 years ago. They usually renew for like 20 years and that keeps it affordable. Also now, given all of these things, that I've cited to you I didn't take the most important thing which we have no control over, which determines a lot about affordability- and it's just too much for me to go through, but I'll gloss over it. And if you have a question, maybe I can answer, and that is AMI. Okay and the federal government determines the AMI, and that is the area. Medium income is a number that's based on your community. Unfortunately, for us they include in our area, medium income, Westchester, and so it raises ours much higher than it would be if we're only looking at New York City, because we're con we're, including what they call a metropolitan area. So that's how that's the basis of our AMI. Now when I came on the board, there was a building that was being built that was built in 2000 called the metropolitan and that's 150 East 44th street. That's around the corner for where the drop-in center used to be at St, Agnes church. That's how I knew about it and I saw it in the New York Times and I said. Oh, my god. The apartments on 44th street this cheap I can't believe it. How do you get one of these apartments? Well, that was not a 421a building that was under one that I had very little to do with or know about, but it's called an 80 20 building. All of these are bonding mechanisms, so in an 80 20 building 80 of the apartments are at 80 percent AMI and it goes up to our income at that time talked about. 2000 goes up to an income of about 60,000 20 was at AMI of 50 and went up to an income of approximately 31 32,000. So if you know what 50, then you know what the AMI was at that time, just double it so think about that. Now the AMI for New York in around 2000, was like 64 65 68,000. You know what it is today. The AMI is around 102,107 thousand dollars. That's a big joke, because that's how you decide what is affordable. You have your AMI and the developer will build with 421a at 60 of AMI. Now, when we say 60, that doesn't mean all of the apartments are at 60 percent. It means it goes up to that level and then beyond that, there's a certain portion of the apartments that cover that area and then beyond that, there's a certain part that may cover 60 or may go up to 120. Okay and some of those are like the american copper building, which is the southern part of the solo site. Solo sold off the part of his property because he wasn't planning on developing anytime soon, so he sold it to Jd. Stern came in and built american copper building right there, where the school is Ps 281. That school is on that same tax property. That's where we lost a lot of affordable housing, because one of the unique things about having the developer build a community facility for you and it gets the school built quicker because he built it real quick for us. But a lot of people don't realize that when you have the developer builders, the site for you on that same tax property, where you're putting your building. Where he's putting his building, we only get credit for the first floor of square footage. So when you're factoring out how many affordable units you're gonna get, you lose all of the square footage above the first floor, so that building is like four stories, so we lost three stories of square footage that would have gone towards affordable housing. On the solo side, you follow everybody following it: okay, that was negotiated by our former council member Daniel, Garatni Ed Ruben, and him got into some stuff about that, because we had laid out one design for everything the school we had actually had the school in the middle of the two buildings, Derrick Rodney Kind of negotiated it and changed it all around and put the school on First Avenue. So anyway, you now you have Mitchell Llama. You have those major development sites which are urban renewal. You have Starvison and Peter Cooper, which you can not say is affordable anymore. The thing is that you have to recognize the categories that exist, there's very low, there's moderate, there's middle a developer can develop in any one of those categories. They choose how they want to develop those properties. If you go through the city after you've done your primary mortgaging with the banks and your other developers, and you want a secondary subsidy from the city, then you can go through what we used to call lamp and that is called low income, affordable market program lamp now Cody. Can you go real, quick to Hdc's website and click on Manhattan Bro? Well, he's doing that I! Think Jim. Did you have a question that you want to ask now or you want to wait till the end, click on Manhattan muted. We can wait, we can just wait. Can you get to the borough Manhattan? It shows a list. I just want to show them the list of the all of the buildings. Okay, so you're looking for their the buildings yeah there you see all of those buildings. Those are all buildings that are well. That's, not the list that I wanted yeah, that's all right. It shows so you see where it says, lap down there, yeah right there lab, etc. These are all of the acronyms that I was talking about, but this is the one that means that they probably went through the city of New York for a secondary subsidy, and that is meaning that they would have to have low income, affordable housing in those buildings. This website is there. Anybody looking for affordable housing can go to this website. You will see some say accepting applications. You will see some that says complete waiting list, but all of these buildings are there throughout the city. That tells you the apartments, the number of apartments at what rate, etc. Okay, now lamp doesn't exist anymore. Now that I've told you about it, HPD changed to what they call Ella I. Think Karine probably knows what l is extremely low. Backslash, low income, affordable program error, a developer can take a secondary mortgage with the city. That means he's committing to affordable housing. They can get up to it varies. They can get up to like 55,000 per unit in mortgaging some have limits where you can notice. You can not go past 15 million dollars, but they can take that secondary mortgage from the city. The micro units in our board is an Ella building. They built 55 apartments. Rosie Mendes was very crucial in the development of that Building, Rosie and I worked on that building with the developer day in and day out, because he came, they came Monona, they came and they did a presentation before us and they said we're going to build some affordable housing and we're going to go from 60 percent. Now 80 AMI to 135,145, AMI and I said not in this district. I said 145 AMI to me is not affordable. So I don't see that and we worked on that. We got 11 apartments that were affordable. We got eight apartments that were for veterans only and some of those apartments went down to 30 percent AMI. What I did was cost it out over the time. Now what I didn't tell you was that all of these developers, when they do the 421a, they get a tax abatement and that's where the board comes in. You have to your advisory, but you can approve. You can say: I approve or I disapprove of them getting the tax abatement, but unfortunately past history says HPD approves it anyway, no matter what we do basically, but it gave the developers a lot of concern when we used to have them come in. They really did they worried about it, but they got a tax abatement. In some cases this is real. I can walk you around the community and show you the buildings where the tax abatement some tax abatements, are for 10 years, 15 years, 25 years and some 30 years. There are some buildings where, if you had an apartment and you had a tax abatement, approximately half the tax liability for that developer was not actuated. Until after, like 13 years, okay, the first couple of first six, seven, eight nine ten years- you didn't pay anything and then it slowly kicks in until you reach the maximum. Now, what did you say to a person that bought an apartment right there? On 23rd street? We had a building where most of those apartments were being bought by foreign investment Llcs, and then they were renting them out, but they were getting tax abatements. Their maintenances were, in some cases, cut by half. So if you had a thirty, four thousand I mean thirty. Three thousand four hundred dollar maintenance you're only paying like 17. 1,700, but that didn't mean that the person that owned it, the Llc, wasn't charging the person that was renting it, the maximum maintenance. So there was a lot of money going around now. Did we have affordable housing? Yes, we had affordable housing. Did we lose a lot of our affordable housing? Yes, there's one last category of affordable housing. That I want to tell you about, because I know: you'll walk around the community and you wouldn't even know it was there, for example, 403rd Avenue that was built by Atlantic, Development, 385, Third, Avenue same thing and then there's a whole host of buildings that were built either for like seniors, elderly and they're, run today by the metropolitan jewish Council and they're in our community. One of my most disheartening things was that when we were losing all of this Mitchell Llama Housing and people were being kind of kicked out of status in town. We couldn't get to elderly people to apply for the housing that I'm about to tell you about. They would allow other people from outside our district to come and take the apartments they preferred to stay in Stuyvesant town and pay half their income in stylists in town. We would tell them about it and they wouldn't apply. So what are some of the locations? Listen because they're, interesting and all of these were built like 2009. 385 third Avenue, which I said 228 East 46th street 332, East 22nd street 171, Lexington avenue those are the primary ones in our area and 141 the one right next to Kenmore. Those are all run by the metropolitan jewish Council and those are affordable, housing units and you would walk right by them and not know that they were affordable, housing units and especially the one that's right across from Baruch junior high school there's a building right across from junior high school that is affordable, housing building. What's the interesting thing about this, those buildings, those are the buildings that generated that extra square footage for the developers, so whatever the livable square footage that you built in those buildings, you multiply that by four and then someone like solo or someone like told could buy that square footage and add it to their building. Now, of course, the Llc's that were building that was part of their companies too. Here's the last one, because this is a unique building, and this tells you what you should be looking for in terms of who might not be registering their apartments. This is an example. North tour is for me are the toll brothers because they buy properties that originally may be scheduled to be rentals, and then they turn them into condos, or they turn them into what they call I. Don't really know the name of it, condo copes Condacols or something, but what it is it's a building has condos and somebody may have brought up a number of those apartments and they turn them into co-ops within the condo building and they're renting them, but those apartments may have come in under 421a. Okay, those are the ones that are most likely not registered, not going when they go out. They don't become rent stabilized. Now. Here's the interesting one- and this is the last one Cody the address- is 259 or I mean 959 or 961. Third, first Avenue, it's called the Sutton. Can you bring that up? Yeah, it's right next to a restaurant there. Can you get a picture of the other building? That's it right there now interesting fact. This is a condo building. You see where the first four or five floors, those are the affordable units in that condo building when they originally sold. They sold from two hundred and fifty thousand and four hundred and sixty three thousand dollars condo units. Second, third, fourth and fifth floor and one was actually fifth and sixth floor. The apartments above it go all the way up to six million dollars, eight million dollars, but these are affordable. So the question I had was when they buy those affordable condos what happens in 10 years when they sell them, they're, not selling them at 400,000, they're gonna sell them at the going rate in that building. This is where some of the lapses in all of our laws exist. There's so much to cover in this. You know what I think I'll stop there. Oh, what one other thing yeah. This is for your committee, because in looking back at some things, I realized something and I realized. This is something that our consultants should have looked taking a look at. There was a project in Brooklyn, uniquely similar to what's going on with Mount Sinai Kings County hospital, together with Church Avenue merchant Business, Association developed, what's called Canberra Housing ventures, they developed property that belonged to HHC and they built on an affordable housing, supportive housing with all of the services of the hospital, mental health, etc. That's in existence. Now, if you look, it's called Cambridge Gardens. If you look at it, you'll get a good example of where a hospital came together with a community organization and built that kind of venue, and that's something that you should take a look at in terms of the development of Mount Sinai. If that something similar like that could be done. Okay, that's it! Thank you so much! Thank you so much Claude and I think Cody just put his head already. Your head is hurting. Our heads are hurting too there's a lot of information and I. Think I'm thinking people probably have some questions because I think I do. But if there are any from committee members just raise your hand or jump in. If you want some additional background on some of the stuff, especially south of 34th Street, including the but not limited to the Bellevue, South Urban Renewal area, I think I mean I, don't know if we're going to do go into a deep dive today, I want to kind of do it more of an overview, but maybe we can have a follow-up blue, because I know you have a lot of information too, on your site, yeah. This doesn't constitute deep dive. This constitutes overview but supplemental to what Claude's done, which is a brilliant job. It's up to you. It's all right, Lou! If you can keep it pretty brief, I think so we can do something you're a mute Lou. You have to unmute yourself, you're still, muted yep am I unmuted. Now, yes, good hear you, there was prior to the Bellevue South Urban Renewal area, a project proposed called Gramercy North and it was from 21st to 23rd from first to second for reasons that aren't particularly germane here. That project failed and Robert Moses proposed the Bellevue South Urban Renewal area 23rd to 29th the 23rd to 29th, includes a building for the elderly and an entire building for the elderly and disabled at modest or controlled rents called Renwick gardens it's on 29th street, and that was also called Sci-10. It was developed by the site, 10 housing alliance, at about the same time as this other activity was taking place, and if you want to see what the neighborhood was like at the start of this entire process, 25th street between second and third avenues, if you exclude the corner buildings, will give you a fairly strong sense of what the neighborhood looked like. In the Bellevue South area, there were a number of as Claude mentioned, industrial buildings, industrial properties, including an arc including textile printing, which was a big industry in the area and those buildings were lost and those building businesses were lost to the urban renewal area. At the same time, there was a series of developments along second Avenue Tracy towers at 24th and second high-rise, new high-rise building, the Peter James, the spruce ridge at 25th street and second avenue, and, at the other end of 25th street and Third Avenue, the Peter James, all high-rise market rate buildings happening at the same time as the Bellevue South Urban Renewal area was under development. Kipp's bay was built in the very late 50s and was the template for superblocks and sets a tone for what was going to be happening and I think we'll leave that there, because there's a lot of other stuff that comes in there was a church-owned property, a national parish, owned property on 24th street. That's right! Next to my building, that's excluded from the urban renewal area, but was sold by the archdiocese to a private developer. After the fact, let me cut in a minute low that is owned by Mount Sinai now. Is it really that's a resident building for their nurses, yeah? That became a privately owned property for a while and was sold New York towers, which, on 2nd Avenue from 24th to 25th, was purchased by private developers at the same time as the Urban renewal area was being proposed and there was supposedly some insider trading, but it became a privately owned development surrounded by the Urban Renewal area. It became extremely valuable. There was a couple of other a couple of other involvements of the community at the time, but we'll leave it there and as we go, we can pick up some of the other material. Okay, that sounds great Lou you're talking about my neighborhood. So it's very interesting to me. Let me go back and repeat something if you want a fairly good idea of what the community looked like from 23rd to 29th. First to third, at the time, 25th street between the high risers will show you what the commun, what the residential community was like. There were low-rise walk-up buildings, very modest rents, 25th street from second to third, according to the cops in the 13th precinct in at this time, when we're talking about the 1960s was considered to be the worst block between 14th and 96th street on Manhattan island and living, there was considered to be risky. It was a high-rise, high-risk neighborhood did you live on that blackline? As a matter of fact, yes, I had gotten out of the army and was looking for. I was working in publishing and look looking for low rent, and that was my neighborhood. That was my what I could afford. There's a there's, some colorful history that goes with that separately. Later on, there were one or two other things: oh Stuyvesant town in Peter, Cooper Village, is a very readable book called to stand and fight about the early development, the early tendency and the early reticences of Stuyvesant and Cooper. It was built as a segregated community and there was an enormous amount of pressure to integrate on the part of the residents, some of the residents in Stuyvesant town, aided and abetted by the American Veterans Committee, and that the book is called to stand and fight it's very much worth reading and gives you some color of the people and the forces at work. Metropolitan life was adamantly opposed to integration and that colored much of the neighborhood in the area anyhow I will leave it there. Thank you so much. Thank you. So I have a couple of questions. Jim did you still have Wanna? Ask something: I see your hands still up. You're, muted yeah I had several questions that I've sent on to Claude, and hopefully he and I can do a sidebar next week sometime, but I did have one comment. Claude mentioned that his building is co-op and that now a lot of the tenants or some of the tenants want to sell out their apartment because of the profit, availability and I wanted to raise. The issue I like co-ops I, think co-ops are great because they give people a sense of ownership that renters tend not to have, but with a co-op on the west side over in Chelsea, you may or may not be familiar with it. It's the it was created originally I, believe by the international ladies garment workers, Union the Ilgwu, and what they do is they limit the profit that one can obtain upon disposing of the property when they sell it, so I think that's a very good model going forward. In my view, unless Claude has some thoughts on it, I think that would be something that we, if we're looking at affordable housing for the district I. Think that's a very good. Well, if we opt to go out, then anyone that is a co-op or at the present Tate. If they do not want to be an open market co-op, then they can become rent stabilized. So they have that option of being when stabilized and usually the attorney general will not approve it. Unless you account for all of those people, so there's a portion of our development. That would probably opt that that's probably the stage one of our development, which is primarily on 23rd street. It was built in stages and built around that building that Lou was talking about, which is now belongs to mount Sinai I I've sent you an email and look it over when you get a chance and let's talk yeah, there's several points in there. Okay, thank you and thanks bud. I think we have a question from Sandy as well and sorry. Let me turn on the video too, and I'm just wondering are all these all the programs that you mentioned I guess, except for Mitchell Lama. Are they still in place and applicable? You mean like Ella, yeah developers, use now to know. L is still in place. The thing about Ella is: if you choose to do that, also there's funding from the federal government that kicks in it's called low income tax credit, low income, housing tax credit automatically kicks in. If you choose any of those programs, so that's why developers will do that if they, you know if they have that mindset of doing affordable housing that automatically kicks in it's l-I-t-H-C, I-T-H-C and so like the one, the four or what is it? The 421a is still active as a as an option. That's an interesting question because you know I haven't been doing the affordable housing, so I haven't been following it, but we changed that law and I testified a number of times when we were changing that law to get all of those things. That I was talking about the variations throughout the building, the permanent affordability. Oh interesting, I'm glad you brought it up for us. We should be concerned about the solo site solo just passed away. He was 92 years old. His son wanted to sell it a couple of years ago. It has special permits that exist on that site and it has a certain amount of affordable housing. That's supposed to be generated on that site. Now that is it what's called an inclusionary zone, which means that you don't do bonus. You don't do like park bonuses and stuff like that on an inclusionary zone, it's automatic when you build, you get an extra 30 that goes on top, and so it automatically goes up to like a 12 farm, but the affordable housing has to be permanent and it is permanent because you can't take the bar. You can't take the apartments off you build them they're there, so it's permanent solo is supposed to build that, according to those permits, he's been pussyfooting around to try to avoid those permits. They were renewed. What he did do was he built the west side of his development, which is across the street right there at 39th street or something I, don't know that black Building Meyer Building yeah that building, but what he did do, and this is another way you get. Affordability is that's the old r10 zoning under the old r10 zoning. You could a builder could build and build off-site or do preservation and a lot of that preservation in the off-site building has to be within a half a mile within our community board. It has to be in our community board, and so what I suspect was that solo did preservation and probably in Phipps Plaza North when they had all of that renovation of flips farther north, they upgraded their apartments, they did the bathrooms over. They did you know all those different things, that's what a developer will do in terms of preservation, so you you're, preserving, affordable housing. That way, and can we find out exactly what he did like shouldn't that be something well, you know, I haven't done it in a long time, but the last time I went on Hpd's website. They had a lot of stuff on there. That I didn't know that they had on it. Like all of that stuff, I was talking about a compensated square footage. They have a whole list showing all of the people that, where that compensated square footage went to who, where it was built and who it went to five years ago, you couldn't find that so Karen and rich. Is this something that you guys are following up with in the housing like you mentioned, you were doing some you're, muted, rich sorry, I was literally just writing a text to Corinne saying we needed to look into the solo site, because I'd forgotten I mean I saw that he passed away and I forgot about this, because I've been thinking about Mount Sinai, but we should both understand what the possibilities are for building there and talk to a land use person to make sure that we're not missing anything because it's gonna be. There are special permits that call for what do you call it a dome? No, you know I can see anything. What do you call it? Amphitheater there is spacing for outdoor spacing and stuff. There are special permits and on that site he has probably the only building that could be built in our community board, which is a commercial building east of Lexington Avenue. That's part of what's supposed to be on that side, a commercial building. So maybe, if it's okay with you Kavitha I'll, take responsibility for figuring out what the broad situation is, checking it with Claude, and then we can have a more directed conversation both in here and in housing. You know how I like it when somebody takes responsibility for something, because I'm really I'm very thankful to see what we can do here. Yeah I am too and we brought it up in land use. We, you know, I, think everyone it's on everyone's radar, so we have to really be focused on that as well. Hang on Lou, one second I, think Ann. You had a question, you have your hand up yeah, and thank you. I'm sorry, I'm not even a member of the committee, but you know Sandy suggested I might be interested in hearing the wisdom here. So, thanks for letting me join in I have my main question was really about how programs, like scree, like the senior rent, increase, exam exemption and rent stabilization, how they fit into the whole picture of affordable housing in the kind of common usage sense of the word, if not the tense, you know not the technical sense. So I was just kind of curious about your thoughts on that. Essentially, what scree does, regardless of what your situation is, if you're over a certain age and within a certain income you're your rent is frozen, that's the short of it! So even if you're in Mitchell Llama right, if you're over a certain age and you file for scree and there's also dre, which is disability the same as the senior you file for it. If you're below that income, your rent will be frozen. At that rate, I guess I just meant that, like as we're looking at what the opportunities are, and you know, kind of what the our what we have in the community board. Maybe we should be considering those kinds of items too, because they're I don't know that's great, but I know that you know rent stabilized, rent stabilization. You know we I live within stabilized apartment. When we moved into this building 27 years ago, almost all of the 64 apartments were rent stabilized now, I think there's half a dozen and I think that's really common. So when we're looking at kind of what our inventory is and again, you know it's not technically affordable housing, but it is what allows you know: middle income, people to live in the district, so I think it is relevant. Well over the years. Those rent guideline increases of two percent add up because they're compounded on top of each other, throwing a couple of throw in a couple of Mci's and that's how you come out of rent stabilization very easily by the time the tax abatement is over, not anymore, though huh not anymore. No I said I'm all right. Lou, did you have something to ask I know you had your hand up before yeah two things, the solo site, the north end of it was he wants to build an office building there that involves the future of the Robert Moses Playground 41St, to 42nd on the east side of First Avenue as a matter of fact, not really. No, I'm sorry, not really that's where the commercial we're an office building for the U.N, I, suppose I know, but that doesn't have anything to do with solo. He wanted to build a commercial building on the south side of 41st on his site, and that was that the source of some controversy at the time and I was wondering if it perhaps it would be a good idea to follow up and to find out what the intentions and planning are and what the pressures are for that site, because commercial building is more in more southern than that site that you're signing that location, that you're signing it's on the middle, almost the middle of the property yeah. We ought to find out. Ask the question at least to be sure that we're what's going on there, because you may have the same intention. There may be other steps that they're taking to accomplish the it's a good idea. I, don't think that building is going to ever get built because the U.N is never going to can't act on it. Yeah and the other is a an add-on to a conversation. There is a new senior building opening at 56th street and Lexington Avenue on the North East corner. It's practically finished, I think it's going to be occupied early in 21. and do we have any read on who's? How that's been built and is that subsidized or is that market rate or what? But that's something for Kareem to look at what you should do is ask to ask the board that all of those developers have to file with the board at some point. What they're building and some documents should come into the board office telling you what building is going up and what it is. You know that building's going to be in inhabited in the next few months. It's for all practical purposes. It's finished and I'd like to find out how that fits into supported housing for the elderly and disabled I believe this is just really expensive: senior housing if I remember correctly and I. The only reason I really am aware of it is because transportation had a hearing on it because of like a loading bay or bike lane. Yes, and it's just crazy, expensive, it's not affordable in any way. So it's for rich seniors, I! Guess that's what it is any and you had your hand up again or was that from before. No, it is again and I want to say first of all, the whole deal with the U.N. That was how you know we were going to get our esplanade and it's like it's I, just don't think that's ever gonna happen. The other thing that I just wanted to throw out there that I have mentioned in land use, but I think it's relevant here is I, think it kind of behooves us- and this is a strategic planning meeting to think really outside the box to there's a lot of commercial space in east Midtown. That is currently, you know, basically empty commercial space. Now that is zoned 100 commercial, like there's, you know no way to put housing in there now. But you know New York is tighter on like everyone's moving now right and the you know the idea that maybe some of that space could make. You know mixed use right like that's something we always are promoting, so I think, let's I'm sorry I know. None of this is really a coherent statement of an idea, but I think we should consider kind of more broader ways to increase the availability of housing in our district now. I think that's a really good thought and I think like looking at opportunities where we might not always- or we might just take things for granted- is kind of part of the whole part of the whole scheme of things so I. Thank you guys. So much Claude and Lou for your add-ons I had a quick question. I don't want to take too long because I know everyone's getting tired and hasn't eaten, probably but a quick question for you. Claude about you mentioned that you were in waterside and then you moved to east Midtown and was that something that was like a lot of the residents did. Was that an opportunity that was afforded to you or was that something that just the first years ravage was having problems getting people to move in okay and he allowed us to have almost I always get this wrong. My wife corrects me all the time. I think it was six months. He allowed us no rent, basically to get people to move in and then at one point he you have to understand that Mitchell Llama has authorities over them they're either state authorities or their city authorities, and you can not just it's not done by when guidelines Board. You have to go through those entities to get rent raises, and so at one point after he had got us all into the building, maybe after three years I think. Maybe it was three years, I'm not sure, but he got approval for rent raises of seven and a half percent nine percent and nine and a half percent, and that was when some people chose to move out. It was cold over there. You had to walk across a bridge and you got soaking wet before you can get across the bridge yeah so that that's what encouraged to move I see. Okay, we do have another question from a member of the public. We have Jen, Sarah and I, don't know Cody. If we can let her ask this live or if I should read it out. One second I can enable her audio there. You go all right, jen, you can go ahead and ask the question. I know: there's a lot of parts to it, so I don't want to get it wrong. Need to read this live. You can just read it yourself and enter it into the record. I. Don't know enough to really ask anything more than what I've asked here. So, okay I'll give it to you guys. Thank you, okay, thanks! So much so yeah jen, just I! Guess you guys can see that ask some questions about what Claude brought up, so we can address those later or look into those in more detail because there's a lot of points here, so I'm not going to get into it right now, that's something you should look into. She has a lot of things too. Okay, thank you for that Jen. If there's no other questions Ann, are you asking another question? No, your hand's still up! No okay! If there's no other question. Okay, no problem we're going to move on to the rest of the agenda, which I'll try to condense a little bit. I do want to give this the update on problem and place website and the task tracker that we've been working on for the last few weeks. The website is, you know, has been live, but it's actually been announced in the newsletter. A couple of days ago, I know we were gonna I, think things are maybe a little mixed up about how we were gonna communicate on this. There was some we were going to do. Some outreach and a couple of messages did go out. Thank you, Corrine and I. Think rich. You had done some outreach to community groups or stakeholders, but we're going to do a bunch more and I. Think Cody. Do you mind if pulling up the website for a second and just running through, and maybe you could give us some stats on since it's been published like how much if people have actually clicked on it or signed or done the survey? I, don't know. If you have that info handy. Yes, the site doesn't have Google analytics, like our main site does, but we do have some numbers based on the number of clicks that particular link got in our newsletter and I have those that was the number one clicked link in our newsletter this month with 54 unique clicks, that's 20 of the total for the newsletter in terms of people who signed up for the dedicated from place newsletter. There were three before we announced this. Now there are 37, so that is a substantial increase and I. You know pull people's answers to the questions that do which do you think we need more of them and share those around. That's great I mean it works right. Oh okay, great yeah go ahead, just Cody, just a couple of things on or whoever on the website do. We have share buttons for social media like Facebook and Twitter, so that this can get spread around a little more and also I tried to log on for the mobile portion of this, which I think is important. It didn't seem to have the same level of functionality. There's not currently any social buttons, but those can be added. I can show you what it looks like on mobile. It's been a couple of weeks since I checked it, so it might have been upgraded or what have you but I didn't get the sense that it was that it had the same level of functionality mobile. This is what it would look like if you went to the site on your iphone and instead of the top menu bar, you have one of these yeah that generates the menu bar and then it turns into a vertical scroll, so that yeah is yeah. We definitely I mean we still need to work on it. Some we were trying to get it. You know just to a point where we could go live and continue to make these updates and I apologize. I was I've, missed meetings and are we live now to an extent where we can share it with schools? And what have you we are we're going to talk? That's exactly what we're going to talk about, because I think we are ready to start the outreach and make sure people see this and start signing up for it and, as Cody mentioned, people are actually signing up and filling out. There's a survey that green button that you see in the kind of right middle of the screen that says sign up for the latest news, taking something where people can enter their contact info and also give kind of a little bit of a mini feedback about what they want to see in the community or in that site. So I think that's really helpful as we go forward. If we can get a lot more of that. That's our kind of next step here and I wanted to talk to all of you, just in a general sense, about kind of a more several month plan. Looking ahead for the next few meetings and trying to plan for something, that's I think this info session today with Claude was so very interesting and I'm thinking if we had something kind of as a condensed version of that for, like the general public about the history of what's happened. You know to things like affordable housing in the community or what's happening to our health care services in the community and potentially did this as a joint effort with other committees. You know down the road, I think setting it up for people to weigh in on what they'd like to see. It's helpful to know you know, what's been there and what's changed in the community rather than just putting it out so I'll take some. You know I'm happy to hear thoughts, but I think if we can target to have some kind of like panel discussion on that, maybe a couple of meetings out, say February and then more of a community engagement effort in the next couple of months after that in the spring I think that would be really good because I know, given even with the second wave of the pandemic. I am quite sure that msbi is looking at their real estate options. Pretty you know, I, don't think their real estate people have put on scrubs and started treating patients I think they're still definitely strategizing about. What's the best option there, so things are going to move ahead and I. Just don't want us to be behind on that type of outreach. So any thoughts from committee members on that in terms of it might be better to do it as a powerpoint presentation, and just you know, post it up as part of the website with audio have like a little video kind of like a yeah. You can create a you, can create a video off of powerpoint and just you know, narrate it and that that'll be essentially a video you may have to host it. I mean host it on YouTube and then just have a link in the website. Maybe we should invite them back again now that we have some people who are interested in the website and use that as a way to spur some more discussion and that we I mean I think because we do tape all of our meetings. Those are being put up on the website. Are they do? We have a way to do that, but Sandy you meant invite, who msbn right, invite I'm sorry invite msbi? Yes, definitely yeah the broads I thought. Maybe it would be interesting and I, don't know if they'd be ready for this to have msbi be on a panel with others. Like with you know, give the update on what they think is happening, but also have I, don't know if it's elected officials or community organizations or people that we think you know would have some more insight on the community. If we had a broader panel of people with different perspectives, it might be nice to have something like that to launch over the next couple of months and that's what I was kind of toying with that idea. Rich I know you reached out to like open, New York, and it's just interesting to see these groups that are working on pushing for more affordable housing or other services and open New York is absolutely ready to work alongside us in any way that we would like them to. So. Maybe that's a good idea. It could be that we do that as a kind of an open discussion with them. So it's just you know. How do we go about doing this? Make it really not confrontational? Just there's some community people who are all have the same ideas right and we know that there's challenges, but that way we could kind of start bringing those to light. I think that would be good, but I do like the idea. Also I do like Jim's idea of maybe having some little some info thing, whether it's like a little ebook or a video or something on the website. That gave us more background. So people can understand the changes that happened over the last few decades. Jim just there's a public comment here. I think it's public comment it's from Jen Seren for before public. You might want to walk through it. Sorry, I, don't know you might want to do a walk through a short five minute with two people talking about the place. That's presumably where the you know. What's going to be, what's going to be redone under Msbi? Oh absolutely I mean I think it would have to be something where we gave kind of a preliminary introduction of what's going on and what we see coming down the pike and then bring in the panel discussion about you know where they are with things. So if people are amenable to that, I can reach out to the brads or whoever else and see if we can get some interest in that in the next couple months sandy but I think what Jen was talking about is maybe you just walk through the site and say why weren't you, oh I, see yeah and also in so far as following up with not-for-profits I would recommend that we go back and review the footnotes from the consultant, the extra you know the rear end pages of that document, because she had discussions with somebody up in Harlem and somebody on the borough president's staff. There were a number of them. I checked off in the power in the Kanban Board that I created right, no I know we're definitely tracking that in the Bro president's office we have the task force, so I would most definitely invite other members of that task, force and community groups to be part of it. It's just you know, let's just figure out a few people to be on a panel and then have within the audience. You know several people who could ask targeted questions. You know based on their stakeholder engagement in this I, think that would be great and Jim I, don't know if you were at. Maybe it was the last meeting where I did mention that at the lab and you have to watch these videos Jim because I want you up to speed yeah I had meant to before tonight and I. Just this week has been no, it's the last task force meeting, and so I'm not sure if you got that update, but they basically are rethinking everything so and including you know the certificate of need at the state level, Department of health they're really rethinking the whole downtown transformation. What's going to happen to the hospital and even on the table, now is staying and renovating the existing space. I, don't know how like what the likelihood of that is. I, don't think that can happen. Given I've seen the space you know, I have my daughter there I can't imagine what they're going to do with it, but you know they said that everything's on the table and I think maybe even phased sales. Other things are on there that they're considering so something for us to keep. Well, that's good news: huh! It's good news! Yeah! That's why I just want to continue to stay very engaged in the conversation here, yeah so check it this weekend, I promise! Okay, so you know, without taking you through every step in the we have the task tracker that Letty's set up that I'm gonna update. I know it's not a trello Jim. We talked about that last time too, and voted on it and everywhere people kind of old school on it. So we are going to just keep updating that there are some definite things that need to be done now in terms of outreach. So hoping to get some a one-pager put together description that we can send out to people as well as getting the pages of the website together. You know like just be able to send things out with a consistent message to our stakeholders. If there's personal outreach, we want to do to a few people. We talked about CB3, CB5 and tenants, big tenant associations in the area- maybe some religious groups, things like that. We can discuss that as well, but I think we're in a good place that we can really start getting people traffic to the site and then start posting upcoming meetings and that we're hoping to have so are our electeds being more engaged on this than they have been well. I mean there was definitely, and particularly the state senator from downtown our former assembly member yeah. You know what I'm talking about yeah. They were at the meeting at the task force at the borough president's task force meeting yeah, so everybody is definitely on top of it. I know there was folks from Carlina Rivera's office there as well. So you know local and state level are engaged in the conversation it looks like moving forward, so I will send out the updated tracker with next steps on it, and just is there any thought on having this as a joint committee type of thing, you know I'm thinking a lot of this has to do with health. A lot of this has to do with housing and there's other things that we're delving into here. I, don't want to step on any toes, I'm happy to have share the you know opportunity anybody want to do so. Well, it's juicy can I it's connected. Are you recognizing me? Can I speak Kavitha, so my comment was not directly related to what you just said, but then it kind of is connected. I was thinking about the newsletter, and you know a way, and also the kind of this powerpoint idea, this idea of creating some content that can educate the public and educate potential stakeholders and encourage them to get involved in the process in a very specific way or in a way that's aligned with their particular interests and goals, and maybe it's about you know coming up with a series of like topics or you know, or themes, and creating like really small kind of bite size like five minute modules. You know of like around that content that could be a short powerpoint or a video type of you know thing. It could also include links to you know to our meetings or it could. You know it could be a lots of different content, that's kind of aggregated together around a theme and that could become I know the basic outline of a newsletter. You know the one newsletter could talk about housing and these different kinds of housing. You know one might talk about public space and community space or one might talk about sustainable transportation or wellness, or you know, I mean so you know, and we could that we could plug in our electeds. We could plug in community organizations we could plug in members of the board. You know we could plug in these different kind of stakeholders into that type of framework. So you know it's kind of just a way of organizing ourselves and I think what would happen is we would be able to generate some content over time that would aggregate on the website. You know and be available there long term, but it could be a way for us to kind of focus our outreach in certain areas initially, as we're kind of you know, building steam and I think it would also help to educate, be a way to educate ourselves. You know on some of these topics dig a little deeper because it's so broad you know, but if we can kind of think of a half dozen topics, you know that we could kind of create these little chapters on that might be one of thinking about organizing ourselves and our outreach yeah. That would be incredible because we already are thinking of having things right. I mean much going on in that one site impactful. Do you think that would be good and yeah I see it? Those folks that worked on the website, you're able to add video pages directly into the website or do you have I mean you can link from YouTube? Obviously, but can the website support video pages? You know what I'm saying so, for example, yeah. Okay, you know I, we haven't tried it out, but and Cody. You may know the answer to this too, but you know I believe that the format that we're using for the website can host any type of media that we create and put there. You know it's true: it's just like it's not going to overload it or kill it. I, don't think so. I have a video online, but as we are, you know since we're using YouTube for these meetings and people can access that there. You know it might make sense for maybe there's already a place for it to live, and we just linked to it, but or it could be that you have a very short kind of clip of it on the website and you link to the like a longer video but as far as I know. Yes, it could support that yeah I. Think a lot of this is going to be a matter of taking of getting someone to do all this and take ownership of it and I played around with the back end of the website too, and it's I think we're limited and Cody I. Don't know if you checked into that, we were going to upgrade like one level up. That was a very small dollar amount, just to get a little bit more flexibility in what we could do, because, right now we couldn't even like support a slideshow of photos. So if we can't do that, I'm not sure you know what it allows for, but perhaps we can look at those options, since this isn't, like a ton of you, know we're not talking about this website going on for a decade or more, it's just it's really now and over the next couple of years that we need to get this stuff going. So beyond that I think yeah and Jen there was a in the Q&A. Had some suggestions too in terms of the outreach, in addition to powerpoint embedded, we could do short, concise, podcasts, that's really great idea. I think, interviews and podcasts could be really interesting, especially tapping into people like Claude, who has like the history of all this stuff in the neighborhood and then maybe responses from electeds, and you know, perspectives from Msbi as well be really great, and she mentioned taking the newsletter to take people's questions and answer questions submitted. I, don't know if we have a section for open questions, I think we did have something in the comment box in our Mailchimp survey, but we'll double check that and beyond that. I really think, unless you guys have other questions, did you want to? Did you want to follow through I? Think I had mentioned a couple of meetings ago, and we said we wanted to wait until the website was live. You want to follow through and do something with cranes in our business. We talked about in the context of the local paper, which I guess now is defunct, but if we're talking about you know a general matter of real estate in the city, cranes is kind of a go-to place. They cranes in the other one I forget the name of it offhand real deal, I guess it is actually town and village still does publish, but it's real estate interesting enough and they put out an edition, but it's both mainly real estate, I think they're. You know I think we should get out in front of all these things. I'm just wondering about the timing and whether we should put that we need more information. Yeah I think we should put that around. You need some substance. If this is going to be the introduction, you need some substance and that's what needs to be thought out and that's not, but just to do some thinking about it. The other thing I thought that well's idea about the pods and the various topics is excellent and I. Think that if you would reach out to the other committees, we would get not only an idea of the kinds of interest and questions, but also, let us be a little more advanced in reaching out to stakeholders. I definitely agree and I'm sorry, I didn't call on you. Lady I saw your hand, it wasn't breathtaking. It was not earth-shaking. No, that's a yeah, that's a great thought, and you know that that's a good segue for me to get into I think get into my chairs report, which is going to be really brief too, but I just want to give you guys a few updates. So we did change the name of the working group. We got official committee status. Thank you, Kyle I know you're on there somewhere, so we're calling it the strategic Planning Committee, because we really felt that this was an opportunity. This particular group is a is an opportunity for all the other committees to kind of come together and weigh in on things. They want to get done so I'd love to have representation from people from all of the committees. On this, if possible, we have one new member today Asia who you turned off your video I know you didn't like your lighting or whatever, but you know welcome we're happy to have you here and I also wanted to announce that wells is vice. Chair of the committee now officially, so congratulations walls we'll be working on podcasts and video clips and all these website things together, it'll be very exciting and I'm trying to see if I have anything else, I'm sorry it was a crazy day. So my notes are all over the place. If anybody else has anything else to add, while I make sure I'm not missing, how are we gonna interact? I mean strategic planning. It just seems you know what I mean. It seems a bit awkward in terms of land use which is supposedly charged with planning realist. You know the that was the committee that was officially charged with doing the charter mandated item of land use issues, so I'm just trying to figure out how this is going to mesh. You know what I mean yeah. No, it makes sense. We went back and forth so I'm happy to take feedback on that. If there's you know, if others have issues with the name, because it was really about community planning- and it was meant to be that this is a subset of all those other committees, but a way to take action within those without you know, taking away from obviously land uses overarching mission. So I take your comment to heart. Gem I think it was really hard to figure out what to say, but at the same time, 197a working group if we're getting out in front of people and the public I wanted to have something that was a little more. You know community focused, so you know we changed the name. I don't know if we can change it again, but I'm open to input yeah I. I'm just concerned that people, you know outsiders, members of the public might get confused. I have no reason to know one way or another, but I would assume that they might get consumed confused. You know. Well, maybe we just have to make sure we're writing a definition of what our mission is. You know that's. We do that's a good idea right so right, but in how we describe our activities and that could help avoid confusion, yeah and maybe say that it's not limited to land use matters right. So that's what we've done. We really did keep the 197a. You know immediately within the definition after that general heading of the name to be really clear about. You know what our task is and what the limitations are of this group. Anyone else nope, okay, everybody's, tired, any old or new business. Oh, she wrote Claude I sent you that email kalitha you're copied on it. Okay, so thank you for that. I got it okay, good all right, so no hands raised for older new business right. Oh I do wealth and Cody I. Think I can't beat you too. It's not really old or new business, but I just wanted to say. Thank you so much to Claude that I thought that was very useful and educational I learned so much from your remarks earlier and so I just wanted to say. Thank you so much for that. Thank you and I never understood that. I'm gonna, it's not gonna, be just rich for the minutes. I'm gonna rewatch it too, because I feel like there was so much information in there yeah I kind of feel, like I, signed up for an ambitious minutes project after going through it, you should just reference the you reference, the video or maybe that's our first podcast. Actually amazing. We just you know edit down back yeah sure you can do that. You're right I think we should I. Think that'd be amazing. There you go! Thank you Claude and rich, as somebody who's done minutes from the video. The easiest way to do it is cast the YouTube video to your TV set. Oh you're, like I'm being here, it's like being here again yeah. Well, it's easier I had to do it for another meeting that I missed while I was sick, so try it and you can use your remote control to keep the same effect yeah all right, very good. All right with that. I'm gonna ask for a motion to no other move. Okay. That is ready to go seconds. Thank you. Everybody! Seeing no further business! The meeting is adjourned at sorry, 30 pm. Thank you. So much everyone see you have a good night bye. Everybody bye.
