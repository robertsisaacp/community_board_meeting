If, there's time following the committee's discussion will field questions from the public and we need a volunteer to take minutes.
So, okay, thanks Cody, so the agenda for tonight's meeting was distributed ahead of time by the board office and will appear momentarily on the screen before you.
You have a question about committee business or wish to make a motion, Please raise your hand through zoom, and you guys all know how to do.
We're really excited to have a presentation by one of our illustrious members Claude who is going to talk about the history of affordable housing and community district 6.
You want to go back to that area, Then you need to talk to Lou, but from Stuyvesant town we had a number of what we call urban developments, urban renewal projects that went on in this area.
All of these are major developments that took place and east of that at one point, Mitchell Llama started building and Waterside Plaza was built, but it was built out on the docks and Richard ravish negotiated a 99-year lease for Waterside Plaza, which he just recently renewed.
But, is as big as the other ones, is the solo site, which is east of all of the other ones that I just mentioned so just think of it as if this was like an open land for grab.
Okay, so I'm going to give you example of the people that have built in our community 14th street to 59th street Fisher, Brothers Solo.
They will make a combination and all invest and do the primary mortgaging to do a development and then simultaneously they will build affordable, housing, small units adjacent to the bigger units.
I think was first started being built in the 1950s, so we had in our community Phipps Houses Mitchell Llama Cody.
You can see it on the river that was built to build waterside plaza and it released to get ravaged for one dollar for 99 years, He just renewed that contract with the city, and that was Mitchell Llama for quite a while for about 25 20.
And then, If you go down to mount Sinai, Perlman Place and where Perlman Place runs into 15th street, you have the booth houses, it's 318, East, 15th street, that's a classified, building classified h8 means dormitory, but that was a building that was for the workers that worked for a downtown hospital, New York, Downtown hospital.
You go out in this community and become a market rate builder, You can imagine what some of those apartments would go for, and it was nothing like when we moved in when we moved from Waterside Plaza to East, Midtown, plaza.
There was Mitchell Llama that came in and at one point around the year, 2000 a lot of those buildings decided to opt out of Mitchell Armor, so we were losing a large share of what was our affordable housing in this community.
If a developer is going to do senior housing, they're building under the statute, 202, okay, well, what was primary in our area and what I focused on a lot is what we call 421a, There's a companion statue that goes with 421a.
It allowed them to build in the south Bronx in Queens in the outer boroughs, affordable, housing and the ratio comes out to be approximately for every one, affordable unit.
All the affordable housing is being built in the outer boroughs in the south Bronx in Queens.
If I built, 25 I built a building of 25 units in the south Bronx, How many condos could I put up on 59th street four times.
You pay taxes, You don't pay taxes on only on the land, not on the land and the building, once you're finished, and you had a window where you didn't have to report the 421a until after the construction is finished, We were generating a lot of condos and co-ops and no affordable, housing.
A lot of the community boards at that time were taking a closer look at 421a and were raising questions about affordability being in our own communities.
That means, When you come in with those units they have to stay designated as affordable and that when somebody moves out, it starts at that rate, but it can only go up like rent stabilization by the rent guideline boards could not go to market rate.
Nowadays is because a lot of the developers didn't register the apartments, and so you know they go in open, market.
The state structure for doing a supportive housing and you'll find a lot of people like breaking ground and those other groups doing that kind of housing.
All of these are bonding mechanisms, So in an 80 20 building 80 of the apartments are at 80 percent AMI and it goes up to our income at that time talked about.
That's, where we lost a lot of affordable housing, because one of the unique things about having the developer build a community facility for you.
A lot of people don't realize that when you have the developer builders, the site for you on that same tax property, where you're putting your building.
So when you're factoring out how many affordable units you're gonna get, You lose all of the square footage above the first floor, so that building is like four stories, So we lost three stories of square footage that would have gone towards affordable, housing, On, the solo side, You follow everybody following it.
That I was talking about, but this is the one that means that they probably went through the city of New York for a secondary subsidy, and that is meaning that they would have to have low income, affordable housing in those buildings.
Looking for affordable housing can go to this website.
They said we're going to build some affordable, housing, Now, 80 AMI to 135,145, AMI and I said not in this district.
One of my most disheartening things was that when we were losing all of this Mitchell Llama Housing and people were being kind of kicked out of status in town.
There's, a building right across from junior high school, that is affordable, housing, building.
You want some additional background on some of the stuff, especially south of 34th Street, including the but not limited to the Bellevue, South Urban Renewal area, I think.
Today, I want to kind of do it more of an overview, but maybe we can have a follow-up blue, because I know you have a lot of information.
It was developed by the site, 10 housing alliance, at about the same time as this other activity was taking place, and if you want to see what the neighborhood was like at the start of this entire process, 25th street between second and third avenues, If you exclude the corner, buildings, will give you a fairly strong sense of what the neighborhood looked.
And I think we'll leave that there, because there's a lot of other stuff that comes in there was a church-owned property, a national parish, owned property on 24th street.
In, my view, Unless Claude has some thoughts on it, I, think that would be something that we, If we're looking at affordable housing, for.
You choose any of those programs, So that's why developers will do that if they, you know if they have that mindset of doing affordable housing that automatically kicks in.
Because you know I haven't been doing the affordable housing, so I haven't been following it, but we changed that law.
When you build, you get an extra 30 that goes on top, and so it automatically goes up to like a 12 farm, but the affordable housing has to be permanent.
And I forgot about this, because I've been thinking about Mount Sinai, but we should both understand what the possibilities are for: building there and talk to a land use person to make sure that we're not missing anything because it's gonna, be.
My main question was really about how programs, like scree, like the senior rent, increase, exam exemption and rent stabilization, how they fit into the whole picture of affordable housing in the kind of common usage sense of the word, If not the tense, you know not.
At that rate, I guess I just meant that, like as we're looking at what the opportunities are, and you know, kind of what the our what we have in the community.
When we're looking at kind of what our inventory is and again, You know it's not technically affordable housing, but it is what allows you know: middle income, people to live in the district, so I think it is relevant.
It's for rich seniors, I, And I, want to say first of all, The whole deal with the U.N. That was how you know we were going to get our esplanade.
This is a strategic planning meeting to think really outside the box to there's a lot of commercial space in east Midtown.
Now that is zoned 100 commercial, like there's, you know no way to put housing in there.
You have to go through those entities to get rent raises, and so at one point after he had got us all into the building, Maybe after three years I think.
A couple of days, ago, I know we were gonna I, think things are maybe a little mixed up about how we were gonna, communicate on this.
Do, you mind if pulling up the website for a second and just running through, and maybe you could give us some stats on since it's been published like how much if people have actually clicked on it or signed or done the survey.
That's, exactly what we're going to talk about, because I think we are ready to start the outreach and make sure people see this and start signing up for it.
There's a survey that green button that you see in the kind of right middle of the screen that says sign up for the latest news, taking something where people can enter their contact info and also give kind of a little bit of a mini feedback about what they want to see in the community or in that site.
You, know to things like affordable housing in the community or what's happening to our health care services in the community and potentially did this as a joint effort with other committees.
You know down the road, I think setting it up for people to weigh in on what they'd like to see.
You, know I'm, happy to hear thoughts, but I think if we can target to have some kind of like panel discussion on that, maybe a couple of meetings, out, say: February, I think that would be really good, because I know, given even with the second wave of the pandemic.
Sorry, I, don't know you might want to do a walk through a short five minute with two people talking about the place.
Oh absolutely I mean I think it would have to be something where we gave kind of a preliminary introduction of what's going on and what we see coming down the pike and then bring in the panel discussion about you know where they are with things.
You know local and state level are engaged in the conversation it looks like moving forward, so I will send out the updated tracker with next steps on it, and just is there any thought on having this as a joint committee, type of thing.
You know I'm thinking.
I, Don't know if we have a section for open, questions, I think we did have something in the comment box in our Mailchimp survey, but we'll double check that and beyond.
Think I had mentioned a couple of meetings ago, and we said we wanted to wait until the website was live.
