You have any questions about this senator hoyleman It's good, to see it's good to see bobby from Brooklyn here, one of my most tenacious colleagues on the issue of small businesses and really reform We carry a number of bills, including together, including to allow 16 year olds, the opportunity to vote in municipal elections and state elections which again speaks to bobby's kind of vision.
Think bobby agrees to the extent that we can continue to campaign through our federal representatives for aid for washington, or you know, consider revenue raisers on our own dime here in the state of new york to help small businesses as well.
There are a number of lawyers across the city who are taking the claims of small business owners who have been rejected by their insurance companies on this very issue and looking at class action litigation and connection with it, as well as certain clauses that may be in their insurance contracts, That may give them a little more flexibility to actually have a legitimate claim for for coverage.
Another important thing about your bill is that it does change the playing field and presumably the litigation strategy for a lot of these insurance companies, and you know, forces companies, insurance companies into negotiation right now, they're just walking away scot-free, So I think that's an important I , actually I want to open it up to We. and I see that in the chat someone was talking about their own experience of applying for a claim, even though they did have pandemic insurance but were declined.
I was actually going to bring up the whole thing about the class action, but based on what I just heard from lily We, don't really know the numbers right, so how many folks fall into these categories, one who groups of small businesses or businesses that have the insurance the pandemic laws in it, others that don't so We should we need to know the numbers of people who are really.
You know my other question- is whether many people actually get this Then people like me, How many just in community board sex- are affected, that they just can't get their insurance because of this hidden clause and whether or not businesses know that there's some legislation going.
You know the issue of commercial rent relief among our legislative colleagues and leaders and two we provide our colleagues with some concrete proposals that we think can address the issue in a some equitable way, So, even if this bill itself doesn't pass or even if assemblymember carroll's bill itself doesn't pass, it's important that we get these issues In the conversation and it's important, that bills represent the concerns of small business owners and the plight they face, because it's just so much more tangible and it gives us it gives us a point for advocacy, and so that's why you know and there's they've done a great job.
I know this might not necessarily be the most popular opinion, but my friends who own these establishments say the best thing that you can do is help them open help them open, meaning or dining Oh, yes, because if they haven't gone out of business, yet it's a long leeway six months, nine months a year to get the money like they need the revenue I hope that they, you know, I hope that we extend outdoor dining for them.
This would affect the vast majority of restaurants in the in the city, and that was actually something that we had put in our in our resolution almost two years ago on the commercial rent control was that you know we wanted a defined definition of small business, because I believe, like federal level, is like 500 or less state We're going to reopen the insides of restaurants or they're going to come up some way they can make business they're going to have to close They can't afford to stay open, and it's because of the rent and also the lack of business I mean takeout is one thing, but you really need if they reopen it , they won't have that many people in there you're going to be limited.
Save our storefronts and who, second, that Okay once again, committee members I'll call your name and just declare in favor against abstain or not entitled kylo thine in favor matt, bondy, okay, dan devine in favor Thank, you so much if I could just finish by saying I'm so appreciative of the support and want to thank again assemblymember epstein for his partnership in this, and thank you again, senator horliman and to your staff as well, particularly sam and kendall, for your great work and leadership on this and for being such great community Can. We go back to the agenda?
So, with this in mind, with this backdrop, with this need to support our small businesses, because it's what makes our communities so vital, you know we This is where how we conceive of new york city and where we congregate with our neighbors Our friends where we meet people is along our commercial corridors in our coffee shops and restaurants and bars.
We put together a pretty broad agenda: lots of pieces of new york city legislation, but some at the state level as well, that we've been pushing for and we'll talk about that a bit generally, they fit in three buckets First is supporting existing businesses, ones that are struggling right now, getting money to them immediately for support.
The, second is heavy sport entrepreneurs, so we can fill a lot of those commercial vacancies that are were already quite prominent before this pandemic and now have really become quite a rash, and, lastly, is how do we invest in local neighborhoods, with the kind of sentiment that now it's one thing to say is shop local, but if people can't access their commercial corridors, if they can't spend time there for various reasons, because of accessibility issues for transportation issues, they can't shop local We need to think about investing in transportation and access and amenities in our commercial corridors if we're going to make them more vital and more accessible, more vital, more accessible, so for the first bucket how we save existing businesses.
We've had some success in pushing for, as I said, legal assistance for businesses, we're gonna, negotiate discussion about opening street space for some retail we've been talking with the bid association So we're continuing to push this agenda, but we think it's something that's for now and for the years to come, This is, you know, a way to kind of re-envision our commercial corridors and small businesses both now and in the future If. Anyone from the committee has questions.
I think it was like in june or july, because we had started seeing this actually pop up in other areas of the country where they were calling it like a Covid-19 surcharge and so for us what we the issue that we actually had with that, because I think at the end of the day, we all want to support businesses, especially like in our local You, know, neighborhoods, one of the things that we actually the purpose behind the bill was more of like consumer protection.
Restaurants are struggling, people are struggling all over the city and that, to the extent that you part of our thinking was that it not only should it be transparent, so you can decide whether or not to incur charge like that, but that it should be directly related to any increase that an establishment is forced to bear because of protections for the consumer, like we were speaking about this in the context dentist's office and the need for them to clean in between each visit and to provide masks and things of that nature So when we discussed this, we thought that it was important that it not only be made clear in advance that there was such a fee.
The speakers that you've invited to discuss to the committee members tonight is really exemplary and, on behalf of the alliance, we really thank you for that and for your resolutions that you all passed tonight and voted on almost unanimously supporting the business interruption, insurance bill, the state of our storefronts bill, controller, scott stringer and all the great work that he's doing on behalf of small businesses.
You had some good questions about why in new york city, can we not have indoor dining when we've met the same exact metrics as the rest of the state has for phase four reopening, yet new york city, we can't have indoor dining and the rest of the city You know there was some talk about outdoor dining and if you're you know walking through the streets of the city, you see a lot of outdoor dining Outdoor dining The alliance was behind the scenes developing that program, but outdoor dining was really just supposed to be a band-aid to help bars and restaurants bridge the gap until indoor dining- and you know even the largest outdoor dining areas, I mean that's really nothing compared to indoor dining and right now there is zero plan from the governor zero plan from the mayor about when we are going to have indoor dining again , it's been safe in the rest of the state, so these are issues that the alliance is constantly working on and if any of you want to talk to me about it, offline I'd be happy to because we really do appreciate the focus that that I saw tonight so switching gears from where I am you're So. You stole my new business report from later in the meeting, so please stick around after, because I'm bringing up actually indoor dining today, I think, given the conversation that you all just had this is this.
Application is really fits the topic, because what we have here is a new york city institution and so just to introduce who's here , It's that coyote ugly, the one that opened on first avenue between ninth and tenth over 27 years ago, You could read about her online, but you know the, and She realized that as a bartender, she was making a lot more money per night than I said she was at her internship, so she started off.
This is a place that, in my mind, will be open another 30 years So. That hope is that we go on 14 14th street, and you know we turn that into our home Now. is I've, got a little bit more money Our new home You know to make your new home, and so we're excited to you know, to work together and to make sure that you know hearing you call it home is really great for us because for all of us, obviously this is our home and our you know our business operators are our people , You know they're part of the family and, as you've heard from all the conversations we've had earlier tonight about making sure that business owners, small and then larger as well, are getting the protection and support that they need and actually I'm familiar with the bar even before it was probably, you know appropriate for me to know about the bar So to see your application was really heartening, and so part of you know, this This process is obviously we want to support.
Acoustical dampening materials, we're a regular bar I know the movie can kind of make people think one way, but the reality is we run a jukebox and so we're really not any louder than a regular bar Yes, people like kevin go and help us make sure that we're doing the right thing for the neighbors Absolutely I mean I mean you know what my philosophy for our committee is always about being proactive, because you know we want to make sure that you can call this home for many years to come, and you know the number one thing that we always see is that people weren't proactive in addressing concerns from the neighbors These questions is to make sure you know that we're thinking about these things and that you know we don't get to a situation where people are calling 3-1-1 and all of that, because we want to make sure that you know that this is a great place for a business to thrive and, at the same time, a great place to live In terms of that, if one of the things that we ask for all operators is that to again to ensure that we're being proactive and that we avoid you know, any sort of conflict is to also have you know, whoever the general manager is on site to have the information perfect see, you're prepared, You know when I opened, the other car I lived a half a block away for 10 15 years, so I've So, you know it's home, You know I was born and raised in new york, and you know those are our people and our regulars live there.
The same people, new beginnings, new beginnings, We want to make sure that you know there are signs encouraging people to be respectful of their neighbors, whether it's you know smoking or sanitation, or you know, noise of course, and also that there's a number that the residents can reach for someone who's on site in case they do have complaints so that they're calling you directly instead of calling you know the police or 301, because often times what we see is if there was just communication between the establishment and the residents, that thing would have been done in a couple of seconds instead of escalating You know it's an unusual time as an attorney who deals with city agencies right now, especially with sidewalk cafes We were part of the group that helped develop the current temporary dot outdoor seating program and that's been very successful and a helpful lifeline for bars and restaurants One of the consequences of that has been that the department of consumer affairs, which I know you know susan, is responsible for licensing sidewalk cafes in the city , they've actually taken the position that they're no longer accepting sidewalk cafe, license applications and they're not going to be again until the temp Temporary outdoor seating program ends, which is currently slated for october 31st, but we've heard all sorts of rumblings behind the scenes and publicly that it's going to be extended later this year and perhaps even into next year and who knows beyond that?
The landlord at 153 first avenue he stopped communicating like he wants his money I, had to hire a lawyer, he's not even responding to the lawyer while I can still probably walk in the door of the bar I, have access to more people, We had pandemic insurance, we're not getting paid out, so it's like who can help us who can guide us accountants?
My family was here last year and it's like that's probably one of the last establishments that they went into before they left new york city and Are there, any more questions or comments from the committee?
You know a new york city, cultural institution and I can't think of something more appropriate at this time than to support you and your establishment.
You know, I think it's the kind of place that I you know, you'll, definitely be a part of and responsive to, community concerns So, seeing no more questions or comments from the committee or the public is there any motion raise go ahead.
as people from the public get their questions and answers in and the committee as well again, Obviously, you mentioned obviously, issues that are on that particular stretch of block We have a lot of you know, bars and restaurants there in terms of noise and crowd, control and sanitation.
Somebody who lives in the community We actually have some issues with bars open till 4am in the morning The people I've reached out to they Sometimes you stay open till 2, 30 We, don't want to know another empty stair storefront on second avenue, with the social problems that are going on at the moment.
Even some old community board members who sent me videos, pictures, and so we reached out to the owner of barcogi, who one week ago, said that they were going to abide by the requests that I made to make sure that they were compliant with everything, particularly with the social distancing, which is obviously of most concern is the public health, and so they said that they were going to implement that you know a quick bike buy or walk by and also follow up with the people who informed me of the issue.
Getting you know more businesses from our district to discuss their experiences and their needs and issues, but if anyone on the committee would love to join me with that in my planning, please let me know: So moving on to new and old business.
So one of the things that we've heard today that I also wanted to bring up is that we haven't really heard any plans from the state level or the city level as to what's going to occur after that point, one of the reasons that you know many businesses, particularly bars and restaurants have been able to continue, is because they've had that option of outdoor dining but come october.
We could put a resolution that asks you know either city council or the mayor himself to put together a plan to to you know before october, 31st for indoor dining Obviously once it goes forward, there's going to be a lot of changes just in terms of public health guidelines, data There's, a community member.
The thing is that I really would like to know what the stipulations would that the city and the state would agree with to open a restaurant right.
I, like you, know, asking first for them to come up with a plan by a certain time, because businesses really need it.
So is very emotion of no objection to a dan's proposal, putting together a resolution asking the city to come up with a plan by september 30th dan You want yeah by september 30th with specifically outlined health metrics second high Is there any other new or old business that anyone from the committee would like to bring up or from the public things that we should be thinking about as a committee, all right, I'm, seeing none, okay, yep, just a question: What happened with the that open street idea on 2nd avenue and I think 51st street?
