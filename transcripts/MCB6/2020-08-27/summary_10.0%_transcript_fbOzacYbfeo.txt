I want to thank the assembly, member and his staff for joining us today and for giving us time to discuss a very important issue.
The, new york state legislature did it last year when we changed a whole host of lease agreements, things like preferential rent that changed the essence of a contract.
Why I believe this legislation would stand up to legal scrutiny, but what I do know is that it is absolutely necessary to save our small businesses in new york.
We need the city council to pass that we need to keep the pressure up so that we can save our critical small businesses everywhere from a local dry cleaner to your favorite bar or restaurant, to theater spaces and music venues to non-profit housing would all benefit from this.
We, don't know what the impact is going to be on small businesses who are currently on the ropes or those who have shuddered or thinking of shuddering because of the challenges that are going to draw this out for many years.
There are a number of lawyers across the city who are taking the claims of small business owners who have been rejected by their insurance companies on this very issue and looking at class action litigation and connection with it, as well as certain clauses that may be in their insurance, contracts.
I think another important thing about your bill is that it does change the playing field and presumably the litigation strategy for a lot of these insurance companies, and you know, forces companies, insurance companies into negotiation right, now, they're, just walking away, scot-free.
It sounds like you've got a good one, but the fact that you actually had that specific kind of clause should set you apart from so many people who you know are just were just subject to physical damage.
Thank, you, fantastic, all right, seeing no more questions from the committee again so open to members of the public.
The state of new york would establish a commercial rent relief program administered by the department of financial services, consisting of up to 500 million in federal funding received by the state, to provide financial assistance to impacted landlords, to make up the difference between the reduced rent and and that the tenants are required to pay in the contractual rent minus the waived.
Now Well, we're already seeing the devastating impact of coba 19 on small businesses across the state in our neighborhood and on our blocks in new york city alone?
Just a you know, a few months before the pandemic to great fanfare, a young woman and her partner came from denver colorado to bring what they considered authentic southwestern cuisine to new york city, particularly the village.
And she's, going to open her restaurant there And, and if the state of new york doesn't intercede, you know we're gonna, give them more grist for that very negative.
In the conversation I mean, and it's important- That bills represent the concerns of small business owners and the plight they face, because it's just so much more tangible and it gives us it gives us a point for advocacy, and so that's why you know.
We were asked that like do they you know, do they make a business decision on the anticipation of a bill like this passing, and I can't to be very candid- The state's budget deficit is so enormous and the federal response has been so uneven that I think I'd I hope it brings landlords to the bargaining table so that your friends who own the restaurant have some leverage with their landlord or the landlord has some.
So, you know, I, think this is obviously dependent on a lot of things and the federal government coming through for us.
I think, technically, in new york, state, a small business is 100, but our bill goes further to 25.
This would affect the vast majority of restaurants in the in the city, and that was actually something that we had put in our in our resolution almost two years ago on the commercial rent control was that you know we wanted a defined definition of small business, because I believe, like federal level, is like 500 or less state Something is going to happen, we're going to reopen the insides of restaurants or they're going to come up some way.
You know, has given some of these restaurants a necessary lifeline, but it's a shame because this particular place has been in this neighborhood for over 30 years, which one is it The bravest on was the 37th and second It's right on 38th , it's right across the street from me, but He hasn't officially taken it over because he said if things don't improve, why should he father to take it over he's taking it over from a relative,?
She needs an offrio in favor, paige judge in favor Thank, you so much if I could just finish by saying I'm so appreciative of the support and want to thank again assemblymember epstein for his partnership in this Thank you, again, senator horliman, and to your staff as well, particularly sam and kendall, for your great work and leadership on this and for being such great community.
Only about 43 of new york city businesses, main street commercial corridor, businesses actually received a ppp, loan.
It's been a real challenge, so, with this in mind, with this backdrop, with this need to support our small businesses, because it's what makes our communities so vital, you know, we.
We put together a pretty broad agenda: lots of pieces of new york city legislation, but some at the state level, as well, that we've been pushing for and we'll talk about that a bit generally, they fit in three buckets.
Some people can get to their businesses, commercial quarters, accessible to young families and the elderly, and everyone else you know with that's been curb cuts and street seating and public bathrooms and bus shelters on our commercial corridors.
People can spend time there and get commercial floors and then repurposing street space for restaurants, which we're doing now, but also for retail and other community uses making use of our street space so that we can help businesses right now.
We've had some success in pushing for, as I said, legal assistance for businesses, we're gonna, negotiate discussion about opening street space for some retail we've been talking with the bid.
This is, you know, a way to kind of re-envision our commercial corridors and small businesses both now and in the future.
I mean we hear from a lot of elected officials, but it's one office that I do feel like Is, really trying to be forward thinking and looking for data which I love, Who is the you know, committee, contrarian I, like it, but one thing, though, of all of the things that just stuck out to me that I'd, maybe ask you guys to reconsider- is the idea of capping the percentage that the delivery services take because, first of all, it's onerous?, And I, think your office should as well is.
People are struggling all over the city and that, to the extent that you part of our thinking was that it not only should it be transparent, So, you can decide whether or not to incur charge like that, but that it should be directly related to any increase that an establishment is forced to bear because of protections for the consumer, like we were speaking about this in the context dentist's office and the need for them to clean in between each visit and to provide masks and things of that nature.
You know this is not just going to be for the pandemic, but for a long time business to recruit their their dollars.
You know like keep on trying if your restaurant is listed as clothes contact them directly and explain why I just don't know if it's just something Does anyone want to make a motion on this to support this plan put forth by the comptroller?
Please state, your name, your relationship to the application and to the establishment, and then please run through the application that you're applying for so Go. Through the you know, a little bit of your professional background, the concept of the establishment, And we'll go from there, and if anyone has any questions from the public or the committee again, as always, please do raise your hand and submit comments through the q and a function and we'll go through those kyle.
You know I get to go to many community board, meetings, not just representing applicants but representing the alliance and the degree of seriousness and sophistication with which you have approached these issues facing bars and restaurants.
The speakers that you've invited to discuss to the committee members tonight is really exemplary and, on behalf of the alliance, we really thank you for that and for your resolutions that you all passed tonight and voted on almost unanimously supporting the business interruption, insurance bill, the state of our storefronts bill, controller, scott stringer and all the great work that he's doing on behalf of small businesses.
Now there is zero plan from the governor zero plan from the mayor about when we are going to have indoor dining again , it's been safe in the rest of the state, so these are issues that the alliance is constantly working on and if any of you want to talk to me about it, offline I'd be happy to because we really do appreciate the focus that that I saw tonight so switching gears from where I am you're.
I think, given the conversation that you all just had this is this application is really fits the topic, because what we have here is a new york city institution and so just to introduce who's here , It's that coyote ugly, the one that opened on first avenue between ninth and tenth over 27 years, ago.
You know that bar on 153, first avenue will never open again And I'm about to tear up thinking about it, because that was my first bar at 25 years.
Obviously this is our home and You know our business operators are our people.
You know they're part of the family and, as you've heard from all the conversations we've had earlier tonight about making sure that business, owners, small and then larger as well, are getting the protection and support that they need and actually I'm familiar with, the bar Even before it was probably, you know appropriate for me to know about the bar.
We also want to make sure that we want to support the comfort and safety of residents and community members, and so obviously, you've had an extensive career in operating the coyote ugly, not only in new york city, but throughout the country in the world.
So we're really not any louder than a regular bar But yes, people like kevin go and help us make sure that we're doing the right thing for the neighbors.
Absolutely I mean I mean you know what my philosophy for our committee is always about being proactive, because you know we want to make sure that you can call this home for many years to come, and you know the number one thing that we always see is that people weren't proactive in addressing concerns from the neighbors.
These questions is to make sure you know that we're thinking about these things and that you know we don't get to a situation where people are calling 3-1-1 and all of that, because we want to make sure that you know that this is a great place for a business to thrive, and, at the same time, a great place to live.
If I could just add to that, you know, even though this has the feel of a regular bar just like liliana said, This business's lifetime, they have become very professional and streamlined.
I really appreciate this, because I think the fact that you're opening what you're opening with the franchises throughout the world, in fact, but you also represent sort of an iconic new york city, establishment, I'm, just curious for liliana in terms of everything that you've done over the years, starting a new york, city, establishment and then obviously getting you know famous because of the eat- love pray, woman right to then be able to build.
My family was here last year and it's like That's, probably one of the last establishments that they went into before they left new york city, and we had a great time-.
You know a new york, city, cultural institution and I can't think of something more appropriate at this time than to support you and your establishment.
I got to get my little girl to bed, but I'd love to connect with you offline about your new business matter that you're on the agenda tonight, because it's something the alliance would definitely want to talk to you.
We want to make sure again that any community issues are dealt with between the establishment and the you know, and the neighbor before you know escalating into something that it does not need to escalate.
Even some old community board members who sent me videos pictures- And, so we reached out to the owner of barcogi, who one week ago, said that they were going to abide by the requests that I made to make sure that they were compliant with everything, particularly with the social distancing, which is obviously of most concern is the public health, and so they said that they were going to implement that You know a quick bike buy or walk by, and also follow up with.
One of the things that we've heard today that I also wanted to bring up is that we haven't really heard any plans from the state level or the city level as to what's going to occur after that point.
One of the reasons that you know many businesses, particularly bars and restaurants have been able to continue, is because they've had that option of outdoor dining but come October.
So I do want to discuss, and perhaps this could be a you know, resolution that we decide on now, or maybe a conversation that we put till next month, but remember it does need to go before full board, which puts us in a time issue what we want to think about for indoor dining.
Or we could, just you know, put a resolution that there needs to be a plan put together for indoor dining before October 31st, because to me just even in terms of timelines, it seems very burdensome and unfair to the local businesses themselves, because they have no way of planning for after October 31st and the closer and the You know the smaller that timeline becomes, the more burdensome it becomes and the more likely it is that they will close.
Like, I, think that would be more powerful and have greater impact if we worked with other board members, as opposed to just saying like this is what we think is good for you know You know, because those conversations are always better if we've thought through it as a committee first, and so that's one of the reasons I like getting things down into resolution form because it gives us a focus, concise.
The thing is that I really would like to know what the stipulations would that the city and the state would agree with to open a restaurant right.
Why I think our committee, in particular, is very successful, is because we're very proactive- We're not doing you know the actual work of it all, but it is expressing what our needs are as committee as community members as residents and as you know, concerned citizens, and that you know the things that we bring up should be taken into their equation and into their processes.
Do you know any other community boards that have already like put a template together for a resolution, so I don't know that anyone is really thinking about it, but that's true of a lot of things that we've done.
And only can you work cody correct me if I'm wrong, that was, you know ahead of commercial rent control like over two years ago, So, for example, we heard senator hoyleman about talking about what small business is, which is something that we brought up.
You know like this is what we have from our committee from our what our full board pass.
I, like you, know asking first for them to come up with a plan by a certain time, because businesses really need it.
Is there any other new or old business that anyone from the committee would like to bring up or from the public things that we should be thinking about.
I. Don't know if you remember the survey about city streets that are usable and not usable, and all of that based on that it doesn't seem likely that that's going to happen in that particular block, because it is a bus.
Is there any other new or old business from anyone else on the committee or from the public?
