I want to thank the assembly, member and his staff for joining us today and for giving us time to discuss a very important issue.
I believe this legislation would stand up to legal scrutiny, but what I do know is that it is absolutely necessary to save our small businesses in New. We need to get these small businesses their working, capital.
We need the city Council to pass that we need to keep the pressure up so that we can save our critical small businesses everywhere from a local dry, cleaner to your favorite bar or restaurant, to theater spaces and music venues to non- profit.
We have to be very candid with them that even if Albany passed this bill- We do not know what the impact is going to be on small businesses who are currently on the ropes or those who have shuddered or thinking of shuddering.
There are a number of lawyers acrosss, the city who are taking the claims of small business owners who have been rejected by their insurance companies on this very issue and looking at class action litigation and connection with it, as well as certain clauses that may be in their insurance.
I think another important thing about your bill is that it does change the playing field and presumably the litigation strategy for a lot of these insurance companies, and you know, forces companies, insurance companies into negotiation right, now, they're, just walking away, Scot, free.
It sounds like you've got a good one, but the fact that you actually had that specific kind of clause should set you apart from so many people who you know are just were just subject to physical damage.
How many just in community board sex are affected, that they just can't get their insurance because of this hidden clause and whether or not businesses know that there's some legislation- going.
Assembly member Carol is often like on the vanguard of these types of issues, around equity, for small businesses and tenants in particular.
The state of New York would establish a commercial rent relief program administered by the Department of Financial services, consisting of up to 500 million in federal funding received by the state, to provide financial assistance to impacted landlords.
The bill would also prohibit landlords from imposing late fees, interest or other penalties uncovered tenants during the Covid-19 state of emergency and imposes a blanket moratorium on eviction proceedings for covered tenants for the non- payment of rent through at least 30 days following the expiration of the Covid-19 state of emergency, and you know the question is: Why is it important and urgent to take action on commercial rent relief?
Well, we're already seeing the devastating impact of coba 19 on small businesses, acrosss, the state in our neighborhood and on our blocks in New York, City, alone?
Since, the pandemic began and without some kind of intervention that number's only going to you know continue to climb the number one reason these businesses are shutting down is an inability to afford overdue rent because of mandated shutdowns, plummeting revenue, disappearance of tourism and what you know You know insurance coverage that basically does not work because of non- physical damage of a virus, even when they do have pandemic insurance.
Just a you know, a few months before the pandemic to Great fanfare, A, young woman and her partner came from Denver Colorado to bring what they considered authentic southwestern cuisine to New York City, particularly the village.
's, going to open her restaurant there And, and if the state of New York does not intercede, you know we're going to give them more grist for that very negative.
In the conversation I mean, and it's important- That bills represent the concerns of small business owners and the plight they face, because it's just so much more tangible and it gives us it gives us a point for advocacy, and so that's why you know.
You, know economic impact by this bill, Yeah, I'm, just going to say within the bill itself, the Department of Financial services is directed to establish a rent relief program for impacted landlords, So they provide, I believe, up to 500 million dollars in federal, funding.
We were asked that like do they you know, do they make a business decision on the anticipation of a bill like this passing, and I, can't to be very candid The state's budget deficit is so enormous and the federal response has been so uneven that I think I'd I'm hopeful that again, as I kind of mentioned, with the assembly member Carol's bill, the fact that we are being the fact that we are serious about a bill like this.
So, you know, I, think this is obviously dependent on a lot of things and the federal government coming through for us.
You, know, I think, we're just encouraging everybody to come to the table, like the senator said, and to find solutions that you know, maybe were not something we would have seen before this.
Six months, nine months a year to get the money like they need the revenue Now. I hope that they, you know, I, hope that we extend outdoor dining for them.
I'm sure that will be up for discussion too, but when you're back in Albany, so we further drill down I, think technically, in New York state a small business is 100, but our bill goes further to 25.
This would affect the vast majority of restaurants in the in the city, and that was actually something that we had put in our in our resolution almost two years ago on the commercial rent control was that you know we wanted a defined definition of small business, because I believe, like federal level, is like 500 or less state Obviously, the city has different criteria for that.
Only about 43 of New York City businesses, main street commercial corridor, businesses actually received a ppp, loan.
It's been a real challenge, so, with this in mind, with this backdrop, with this need to support our small businesses, because it's what makes our communities so vital, you know, we.
In order to support these businesses and support our neighborhoods, we put together a pretty broad agenda: lots of pieces of New York City legislation, but some at the state level, as well, that we've been pushing for and we'll talk about that a bit generally, they fit in three buckets.
Some people can get to their businesses, commercial quarters, accessible to young families and the elderly, and everyone else you know with that's been curb cuts and street seating and public bathrooms and bus shelters on our commercial corridors.
People can spend time there and get commercial floors and then repurposing street space for restaurants, which we're doing now, but also for retail and other community uses making use of our street space so that we can help businesses right now.
This is, you know, a way to kind of re- envision our commercial corridors and small businesses both now and in the future.
Some of the recommendations there, but one that struck me or stuck out in my mind, was the ban on expediters at the DOB The thinking is behind that is it because it's a bar, you know hiring an expediter is a bar to some small businesses.
I, think it was like in June or July, because we had started seeing this actually pop up in other areas of the country where they were calling it like a Covid-19 surcharge and so for us what we the issue that we actually had with that, because I think, at the end of the day, we all want to support businesses, especially like in our local.
You know, neighborhoods, one of the things that we actually the purpose behind the bill was more of like consumer protection.
We put something out mostly just about being sure that was transparent and did not honestly have strong feelings about the charge itself, because I think, in that case, much to Dan's point, was as a consumer once you're educated about that you can make your own financial decision about it to say, hey We're all trying to you know, get back and make sure that you know New York City gets back to where it was They.
People are struggling all over the city and that, to the extent that you part of our thinking was that it not only should it be transparent, So, you can decide whether or not to incur charge like that, but that it should be directly related to any increase that an establishment is forced to bear because of protections for the consumer, like we were speaking about this in the context dentist's office and the need for them to clean in between each visit and to provide masks and things of that nature.
You know this is not just going to be for the pandemic, but for a long time business to recruit their their dollars.
You know like keep on trying if your restaurant is listed as clothes contact them directly and explain why I just do not know if it's just something Does anyone want to make a motion on this to support this plan put forth by the comptroller?
Please state, your name, your relationship to the application and to the establishment, and then please run through the application that you're applying for so Go. Through the you know, a little bit of your professional background, the concept of the establishment, And we'll go from there, and if anyone has any questions from the public or the committee again, as always, please do raise your hand and submit comments through the Q&And, a function and we'll go through those kyle.
Before I talk about coyote ugly, which I'm here to talk about tonight, I, just wanted to spend 60 seconds or so wearing the other hat that I wear, which is counsel to the New York City Hospitality Alliance, our industry trade association here in the city that represents over 2,000 bars and restaurants, and I.
You know I get to go to many community board, meetings, not just representing applicants but representing the alliance and the degree of seriousness and sophistication with which you have approached these issues facing bars and restaurants.
The speakers that you've invited to discuss to the committee members tonight is really exemplary and, on behalf of the alliance, we really thank you for that and for your resolutions that you all passed tonight and voted on almost unanimously supporting the business interruption, insurance bill, the state of our storefronts Bill, Controller, Scott, Stringer, and all the great work that he's doing on behalf of small businesses.
Our bars and restaurants are at a crisis point and we're really glad to see the members of this committee at least are recognizing that- New York City Can, we not have indoor dining when we've met the same exact metrics as the rest of the state has for phase four reopening, yet New York, City?
Now there is zero plan from the governor zero plan from the mayor about when we are going to have indoor dining again , it's been safe in the rest of the state, so these are issues that the alliance is constantly working on and if any of you want to talk to me about it, offline I'd be happy to because we really do appreciate the focus that that I saw tonight so switching gears from where I am you're.
You know that bar on 153, first Avenue will never open again And I'm about to tear up thinking about it, because that was my first bar at 25 years.
Obviously this is our home and You know our business operators are our people.
You know they're part of the family and, as you've heard from all the conversations we've had earlier tonight about making sure that business, owners, small and then larger as well, are getting the protection and support that they need and actually I'm familiar with, the bar Even before it was probably, you know appropriate for me to know about the bar.
We also want to make sure that we want to support the comfort and safety of residents and community members, and so obviously, you've had an extensive career in operating the coyote ugly, not only in New York City, but throughout the country in the world.
So in terms of noise, level, And I know you put some of this in the application, but we also want to make sure that people from the public can hear about this in terms of noise, crowd, Control, security.
I know the movie can kind of make people think one way, but the reality is we run a jukebox And, so we're really not any louder than a regular bar But yes, people like Kevin go and help us make sure that we're doing the right thing for the neighbors.
Absolutely I mean I mean you know what my philosophy for our committee is always about being proactive, because you know we want to make sure that you can call this home for many years to come, and you know the number one thing that we always see is that people were not proactive in addressing concerns from the neighbors, and so that's one of the reasons we always ask.
These questions is to make sure you know that we're thinking about these things and that you know we do not get to a situation where people are calling 3, 1, 1, and all of that, because we want to make sure that you know that this is a great place for a business to thrive, and, at the same time, a great place to live.
If I could just add to that, you know, even though this has the feel of a regular bar just like Liliana said, I mean they are very at this point in time.
I really appreciate this, because I think the fact that you're opening what you're opening with the franchises throughout the world, in fact, but you also represent sort of an iconic New York City establishment, I'm, just curious for Liliana in terms of everything that you've done over the years, starting a New, York, City establishment and then obviously getting you know famous because of the eat , love pray, woman right to then be able to build basically an incredible business.
My family was here last year and it's like That's, probably one of the last establishments that they went into before they left New York City, and we had What's going on with social equality, and I, do not know.
You know a New, York, City, Cultural, Institution, and I can't think of something more appropriate at this time than to support you and your establishment.
We want to make sure again that any community issues are dealt with between the establishment and the you know, and the neighbor before you know escalating into something that it does not need to escalate.
And I know you'd, like the option to stay open until four, And I worked in the irish eggs when it was previously in irish park, which it was for 40 years.
We already have the restaurant row, East alliance, who has been doing a lot of great work for the community too, and making sure that things are organized and noiseless, and you know social, distancing and all of that , You know is why we're going through all this and why your conversation?
Even some old community board members who sent me videos pictures- And, so we reached out to the owner of barcogi, who one week ago, said that they were going to abide by the requests that I made to make sure that they were compliant with everything, particularly with the social distancing, which is obviously of most concern is the public health.
Getting you know more businesses from our district to discuss their experiences and their needs and issues, but if anyone on the committee would love to join me with that in my planning, please let me know You are interested in working on that with me.
One of the things that we've heard today that I also wanted to bring up is that we have not really heard any plans from the state level or the city level as to what's going to occur after that point.
One of the reasons that you know many businesses, particularly bars and restaurants have been able to continue, is because they've had that option of outdoor dining but come October.
But remember it does need to go before full board, which puts us in a time issue what we want to think about for indoor dining.
So I do want us to be proactive on this and coming together with some ideas or even just coming together to you, know, light a fire under the city to make sure that they are thinking about this proactively and are putting something together that is actionable and also.
I do think the sooner the better that we can back something like this, especially when we know that places just outside of the city are more or less.
There's, a community member And I know that initially, it was kind of initiated through like talking about race and economic justice, issues that are shared acrosss.
But, you know, I, think that we could kind of tie if we could tie this in with like either what all the other Manhattan community board.
The thing is that I really would like to know what the stipulations would that the city and the state would agree with to open a restaurant right.
I mean that's true of any resolution we ever put forth in any committee Is that oh, the city might always know more, but We do not need to do something right, now, but there is a time crunch, because we are the last committee that meets before full boards.
Do you know any other community boards that have already like put a template together for a resolution, so I do not know that anyone is really thinking about it.
I, think we're still the first, and only can you work, cody, correct me if I'm wrong, that was, you know ahead of commercial rent control like over two years ago So, for example, we heard Senator Hoyleman about talking about what small business is, which is something that we brought up.
Is there any other new or old business that anyone from the committee would like to bring up or from the public things that we should be thinking about.
I do not know if you remember the survey about city streets that are usable and not usable, and all of that based on that, it does not seem likely that that's going to happen in that particular block, because it is a bus.
