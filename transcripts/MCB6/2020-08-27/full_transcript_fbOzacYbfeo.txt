As mentioned, the minutes for this meeting will be up next month as well. So, first up, I want to welcome assembly member Robert Carroll, who will be talking to us about an assembly bill which is also reflected in a Senate bill regarding business interruption insurance. I want to thank the assembly, member and his staff for joining us today and for giving us time to discuss a very important issue. So can we turn it over to the assembly member no good evening, community Board? Seven! Thank you so much kyle and everyone else for having me to discuss this most important issue. In a nutshell, I carry and drafted two pieces. Two pieces of legislation that deal with business interruption claims the first being a retroactive bill that would allow for any business that had purchased business interruption insurance to make a retroactive claim back to March 6 for any damages that they have that they believe should be covered by their business interruption policy that was rejected because of an exclusion. An exclusionary clause in that contract that excluded viruses, microbes and bacteria. That bill has 45 co- sponsors in the assembly and about 25 in the Senate, and then I have another bill. That is a prospective bill that would make it known and void from this day forward whenever we would pass the bill to have exclusory clauses related to viruses and would make them null and void due to public policy, both bills would do that. The second bill just would not deal with any retroactivity. I these bills are necessary. They are both, I believe, would stand up to legal scrutiny. I think you are a dime store lawyer if you believe that the state legislature or state legislatures around this country have not retroactively changed contracts. The New York State Legislature did it last year when we changed a whole host of lease agreements. Things like preferential rent that changed the essence of a contract. Of course, almost every single labor law that states and the federal government have ever passed and, of course, there are folks in our state who still have discriminatory covenants for their for their homes or co-, ops or condo units. And of course we do not enforce those and we pass the legislation that would not allow to enforce them. So I do not want to get into the raptures of the deep about why. I believe this legislation would stand up to legal scrutiny, but what I do know is that it is absolutely necessary to save our small businesses in New York. The insurance industry is sitting on one trillion dollars of reserves. They got those reserves because small businesses have been paying premiums for years and years and years. We need to get these small businesses their working capital. I was talking to a theater company in Manhattan yesterday they were one of the few small businesses that had a policy that actually covered coded19 and their insurance company just rejected all of their claims because they got a ppp loan. These folks are mendacious. They will use anything not to pay out a claim. I hope that folks, like yourselves, can call your assembly member your state Senator. I see your state senator is on the zoom. Now I believe, he's a co- sponsor of the bill and, if he's not, he should be, and we need to get this moving in the state, Senate and Assembly. We need the governor to sign it. We need to get there's a resolution in the city council. We need the city Council to pass that we need to keep the pressure up so that we can save our critical small businesses everywhere from a local dry cleaner to your favorite bar or restaurant, to theater spaces and music venues to non- profit housing would all benefit from this legislation. Thank you so much assembly member. I want to open it now for questions. I know when we first were discussing this issue over a month ago. There were a lot of questions that we had, so I just want to open it up to the committee to see what specific questions we have about this proposed legislation. Well, actually, as we wait for hints to go up one of the things if you could clarify for us- and I know for some people of the public as well, what is the big challenges that you're, seeing as being you know, push back against this bill or is it something that's kind of universally accepted as being necessary and productive, or are you facing some sort of you know, intentions or challenges to getting this done great question kyle? What we're seeing pushback from the insurance industry and from the status quo? What we need is we need folks to realize that, in regular times, the sanctity of contract is something that we all respect and I'm an attorney by trade, but it is the job of the legislature when contracts are so unequal to step in and to rebalance the scales and the insurance industry knows this because they're highly regulated, they're insured, the contracts that we're talking about are actually reviewed by the Department of Financial services and the businesses that we're talking about have 250 employees or less. So these are contracts that are akin to your cell phone contract. Your mortgage, you have no ability to change the terms of these contracts, they're adhesion contracts in essence, and what we're coming back in what we're deciding here is to say the insurance companies have pulled a fast one when they got this clause slipped in after the Sars outbreak that it's one sentence in a contract. That's usually 300 pages long. That says this policy excludes viruses, microbes and bacteria. I do not believe the folks at the Department of Financial services who reviewed this contract believed that there would be a worldwide pandemic that would shut down the global economy. I believe they read that and thought. Well. If your small business gets the flu, you can't put an acclaim for the flu, not if you were shut down by the city in the state of New, York and the global economy comes to a screeching halt because of a highly contagious virus. You do not have a claim in the courts of the state of New York when there's a dispute about an insurance contract, they look to see what a reasonable person who purchased that insurance would believe what was covered, and I can tell you: I've talked to a whole host of businesses. All of them believed an episode like this would be covered and I believe that they are reasonable and prudent in that assumption. Thank you so much for the clarification, so any other committee members, you have any questions about this Senator Hoyleman. Do you have anything to add to that? I know you are a co- sponsor off the center. I am, I am it's good to see it's good, to see bobby from Brooklyn here, one of my most tenacious colleagues on the issue of small businesses and really reform. Generally speaking, he's really he's been a leader. We carry a number of bills, including together, including to allow 16 year olds, the opportunity to vote in municipal elections and state elections, which again speaks to Bobby's kind of vision. You know the thing I worry about, you know, there's a quote that an incompetent lawyer can delay a trial for months or years. A competent lawyer can delay one for even longer, and so you know, while all this legislation that we're considering is key, I do not know to be very candid. How much of it sadly applies to our current small businesses that are in the midst of this economic crisis, and I think we have to be. We have to be very candid with them that even if Albany passed this bill- and I God hope we do or the one that I carry, we do not know. We do not know what the impact is going to be on small businesses who are currently on the ropes or those who have shuddered or thinking of shuddering because of the challenges that are going to draw this out for many years. So you know, I think, Bobby agrees to the extent that we can continue to campaign through our federal representatives for aid for Washington, or you know, consider revenue raisers on our own dime here in the state of New York, to help small businesses as well. As you know, everyone else who is hurting, including the most vulnerable, we're going to have to do that. That's just really what it boils down to. There is not a lot of room for us to be complacent about any of these options. So that's what I would say about Bobby's bill. I am a proud co- sponsor and I think it's outrageous that insurance adjusters are trying to. You know squirm their way out of responsibility. I will say that there are- and I might have missed the earlier part of the assembly member's presentation. There are a number of lawyers acrosss, the city who are taking the claims of small business owners who have been rejected by their insurance companies on this very issue and looking at class action litigation and connection with it, as well as certain clauses that may be in their insurance contracts. That may give them a little more flexibility to actually have a legitimate claim for for coverage. So you know we need to encourage. You know our small businesses, not just to you know, lay down their arms but to actually pursue it vigorously to the extent they're able to through their own legal representation. I thank you. I agree with Brad's proactive recommendation that no one, no small business should rest on their laurels and not actively participate in doing what is best for them and what is most advantageous, be that legally or any other avenue. I do think it is important, though I do want to highlight this- is that I do not think we should continually wait for the federal government. I think the state needs to be bold. I think the agreed referenced revenue raisers. We should be doing that the day after labor day. We need to act now, because God Willing, Joe, Biden and Kamala Harris will be inaugurated on January 21st, but January 21st is still a long way away and then they've got to take control of a completely devastated federal government. We need relief right now for small businesses. I do not think business interruption. My two bills are a magic bullet, but I do think they could be part of an arsenal that would hopefully bring relief to some, if not many small businesses in our city, and I think another if I could just interrupt Bobby. I think another important thing about your bill is that it does change the playing field and presumably the litigation strategy for a lot of these insurance companies, and you know, forces companies, insurance companies into negotiation right now, they're just walking away Scot- free. So I think that's an important. You know cascading effect, that your legislation would have. That's a great point. Thank you and I actually, I want to open it up to. We have two applicants here tonight who are applying for licenses, and I see that in the chat someone was talking about their own experience of applying for a claim, even though they did have pandemic insurance but were declined. Could you speak more to that cody? Could we meet them? They can not mute themselves, I'm Leanna from priority ugly. So we have pandemic insurance for nine of our bars have been declined. We in fact have hired litigators, because you know we've been paying for 10:15 years on this insurance and it's just getting pushed to the back pushed to the back and all we've been told, is to hold on to just wait. So I do not know why you were denied. I do know that I talked to a theater company in Chelsea just yesterday, and I know their development director very well and she told me that they were rejected basically because they got a ppp loan and they had done some fundraising, some emergency fundraising off of Covid-19, none of which made up the massive loss in general, fundraising and ticket sales and everything else that this theater company does, and I so I do not know why you were specific and we were told to come back and try again, because our insurance was the top level for that specific type. In fact, most people do not even ever get pandemic insurance yeah, so they told us to try again, but they did not link it to our ppp loans, but our ppp loan was 70 dollars that would not have covered a month. You know now we're sitting closed for six months. What I think this proves is just how mendacious these insurance companies are, and it's one reason why I have two pieces of legislation. One is the retroactive film. One is just a prospective bill that would, you know, say that they can no longer have this blanket virus exception exemption. But it's because just like this right, people similar things with sand and other things that suddenly you put in a claim, a legitimate claim that you think paid out insurance company. It behooves them to keep falling on the ball and keep denying claims and kind of put up roadblocks in hopes that you will either stop or that through attrition. You will give up or you will something will happen, and I think it's why it's so important. It sounds like you have an attorney and that you're going to fight back that, I think, is really necessary. This situation. What it's made me realize is just, I feel awful for the mom and pops who do not have the ability to you know financially or even just you know the knowledge to go out and kind of seek justice for themselves, because this is uncharted waters and you feel like you're, a number, that's at a bottom of a list and you're calling and calling and calling with no people giving you any advice. This is very hard to navigate what's going on and if you want, we could talk Offline. We talked to some people at the Department of financial services. All the time- and I you know we could highlight that this is happening to you because I'm sure it's happening to, and I just talked to a theater company. It's happening to I'm sure there are hundreds, if not thousands, small businesses in New York that this is happening to absolutely. I have no doubt and I'll tell you this most of my peers in this industry actually did not get this particular type of insurance. We did, and it's just heartbreaking to know that this is when you know, we've been paying for years. This is when we need it and it's not there big surprise right exactly and having through Katrina honestly, you know down there. This is kind of the same thing, so I was expecting it, but it takes years and years to finally get some of these funds. Thank you. I appreciate you sharing your experience with us Genie. I saw that you had a hand up earlier. Was your question answered or do you still have a question? Oh I'm going to have to go. This is Brad, but so to the extent, I'm so sorry that I obviously have a time crunch here, but I will say this: if I could, you should look for you know a civil authority clause in your insurance, I'm sure your attorneys already have, but that's another hook through which some of these class actions are proceeding, based on the fact that a government has ordered shutdowns. There is some room to claim business interruption on that hook. Something I would recommend- and I think I think you know shopping for the right attorney you know is key. It sounds like you've got a good one, but the fact that you actually had that specific kind of clause should set you apart from so many people who you know are just were just subject to physical damage. You know a period and that and that insurance company is trying to again squeeze their way out of it is outrageous and as Bobby mentioned as Assemblymember Carol mentioned, you know, New York is home to the insurance company's kind of headquarters, acrosss the world and the state of New York, unlike the federal government, has specific regulatory authority over insurance companies. So I think I think the Senate member Carol would agree. We should have a lot of bargaining power as it pertains to insurance companies because of those facts all right. Thank you. So much senator and, of course, we're also discussing your bill later in the meeting as well. Save our streets save our storefront. Sorry yeah Jeannie did you have a question yeah just a couple of comments. One is. I was actually going to bring up the whole thing about the class action, but based on what I just heard from Lily. Is that your name, I'm sorry yeah hi nice to meet you that it seems that there's no collective. We do not really know the numbers right so how many folks fall into these categories, one who groups of small businesses or businesses that have the insurance the pandemic laws in it, others that do not. So I'm just thinking my thought is we should we need to know the numbers of people who are really you know. Businesses are really in big trouble because of this clause right, and I think that will help legislation to know how many businesses, how many dollars are affected by all this so and my other question- is whether many people actually get this yeah. I think because I have businesses in other parts of the country that have more, you know, hurricanes. You know we're dealing with that right now. Things like that. We added stuff like that. So I have a feeling. Regular mom and pops probably do not get this insurance and they're screwed. But then people like me, that's had it for years, so not getting any payout. So I would be curious. How do we find out which businesses not just that clause that even if they have it or not, but which businesses are affected? How many dollars, how many just in community board sex are affected, that they just can't get their insurance because of this hidden clause and whether or not businesses know that there's some legislation going. You know into Albany about this and whether my other, my only other question, is whether or not the media knows about this. Like is this being reported on a wider scale, so the media definitely knows there have been articles about this bill, specifically in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Cranes Cnbc, to name a few it. There are two versions of the bill: the first version, the retroactive version has a about 45 assembly sponsors and about 25 Senate sponsors. So it's pretty well known by the membership. The the exact the example that that Hannah, I believe, is your name Hannah mentioned- is highly rare. I know a handful of other businesses that did not have the virus exclusion clause, but I probably between 80 and 90 percent of businesses that had business interruption insurance through their casualty and liability insurance had this exemption and these policies are anywhere from about 90 pages to 300 pages. So many folks did not know that this exemption existed until after the fact some folks, you know, have had these policies for 20:30 40 years, and this clause was put in about 14 or 15 years ago, so they were very unaware of it, and so you should assume that most businesses that carried casualty and liability insurance, the clue that included business interruption. There is a virus exemption and that it is broadly interpreted as not covering Covid-19. Even though Senator Hoyleman mentioned you know the civil authority shutdown as one of the hooks and mayor De Blasio in his shutdown orders even referenced that partially because of some smart trial attorneys, who were looking at making sure to have a foothold for litigation. Thank you, fantastic all right, seeing no more questions from the committee again so open to members of the public. I do want to mention a stat that was put into the comment box addressed to Eugenie. One of the attorneys present tonight said that this is an extremely important issue near the top of the list of concerns that, over that their over 2,000 plus bars and restaurants. Members tell them about so you know clearly very impactful for everyone around, so I have not seen thank you. Yup go ahead and put some remember, please, you know I I've been on zooms like this with whole hosts of different community boards, bids alliances, etc. Please call your assembly member call. Your senator call the leadership of the Assembly and Senate. You know if you're affected by this, we need to take action. I really do hope that we will be up in Albany in early to mid- September. We do not want to miss an opportunity, please let your voices be known to your local representatives. It really does mean a lot and your voice voices could help get something like this passed in the next few weeks. Thank you so much, and that's actually a great segue to me asking if anyone wants to make a motion in support of these bills. Please raise your hand if you'd like to make the motion and then we'll have someone. Second, it anton all right I see Anton. Can we unmute my anton so that we can have it on the record? Please make a motion to follow this rule and recommend it for the passage thank you and it seems that is second by Susan. Steinberg, that's correct! Thank you! So let us do the roll call in support of the assembly members bill as well as the Senate bill on the record as well. Okay, committee members, I'll call your name and just declare in favor against abstain or not entitled. Please kyle aside in favor recorded Matt, Bondy Matt had joined us early. Let's see him, please remember to unmute yourself, Dan divine against Genie Dino for you in favor page. If you could unmute yourself, please page we'll go to has yousef joined us. Nope John, Keller, Kathleen Kelly is in favor Anton Mallner in Favor Kevin O'keefe in Favor Frank Scala has he joined us, see Michelle Abstain for Cause, okay, Susan Steinberg in favor, okay Paige in favor. Thank you all right. That brings us to eight in favor one against and one abstention for calls not entitled. So that motion carries all right. Thank you so much to the committee and thank you again assemblymember for joining us. Thank you. So much for being on the forefront of this and really pushing this, and we are obviously happy to support that bill going forward. Thank you so much it was so great talking to all of you. I hope you're well and enjoy the rest of your summer. Thank you. So much all right. So let's go back to the agenda. Please Brendan. Can we put the agenda back up? Sorry just a moment. Just give me a I moment. Add it back up. Okay! Here we go awesome. Thank you. So, as I mentioned earlier, we're also still joined by state Senator, Brad Homan who's not only involved with the previous role, but has another bill as walk on saving our storefront. So again, thank you to the state senator and to his office and staff for joining us today and for providing us on more information about this particular bill. My pleasure thanks for having me- and I will be brief- you say presentation I feel like I'm about to give my graduate thesis or something making me a little nervous here. But no, I appreciate the seriousness with which you are approaching this issue because of its impact on board six and so many other small businesses. Briefly, you know this bill, which we have called the save. Our storefronts legislation is S 8865 810,901. I have to give a shout out to our assembly member Harvey Epstein. I do not know if he's here, but he's the assembly sponsor and drafted the original version with which then we drafted a subsequent version together. So definitely credit to assemblymember epstein he's a great legislative partner and Like Assembly member Carol is often like on the vanguard of these types of issues, around equity, for small businesses and tenants in particular, so the bill basically would set forth at the obligation of covered tenants and the tenants that would be covered would be. This would be Covid-19 impacted, small businesses and non- for- profits would be the would be limited. Their rent would be limited to the lesser of a 20 of their actual income in a given month or b. One third of their contractual rent payment landlords of covered tenants would be required to waive 20 of the contractual rent. This is you know the only way we see these small businesses surviving under this environment. The state of New York would establish a commercial rent relief program administered by the Department of Financial services, consisting of up to 500 million in federal funding received by the state, to provide financial assistance to impacted landlords, to make up the difference between the reduced rent and and that the tenants are required to pay in the contractual rent minus the waived. 20, the limited rent obligation would extend through six months following the expiration of the Covid-19 state of emergency. The bill would also prohibit landlords from imposing late fees, interest or other penalties uncovered tenants during the Covid-19 state of emergency and imposes a blanket moratorium on eviction proceedings for covered tenants for the non- payment of rent through at least 30 days following the expiration of the Covid-19 state of emergency, and you know the question is: why is it important and urgent to take action on commercial rent relief now and I often get asked what do you envision happening in New York if there is no rent relief? Well, we're already seeing the devastating impact of coba 19 on small businesses, acrosss the state in our neighborhood and on our blocks in New York, City alone? Over you know, 3,000 small businesses have permanently closed and that number's much higher I'm sure at this stage, since the pandemic began and without some kind of intervention that number's only going to you know continue to climb the number one reason these businesses are shutting down is an inability to afford overdue rent because of mandated shutdowns plummeting revenue, disappearance of tourism and what you know Assemblymember Carol was talking about. You know insurance coverage that basically does not work because of non- physical damage of a virus, even when they do have pandemic insurance. The insurance companies are trying to squeeze out of it, and if we do not do anything, our neighborhoods are just going to be full of empty storefronts. I mean we saw that happening before the virus. I conducted a study in my in our Senate district, where we surveyed this was a few years ago, Chelsea and Bleaker Street, and if folks remember how thriving Bleeker Street was, you know seven years ago and then how it just became a ghost town and we call the we call the study bleaker on bleaker because we love a pun, but also because it's the reality of the fact that we found then that close to one- fifth of the storefronts were shuttered due to rising rents and the mentality of some landlords, not all, but for some landlords to look beyond their current tenant into maybe what they call a credit worthy tenant or some cash cow always chasing the next. You know kind of Rainbow, I'm devastated by story that I read recently in the blog eater, where a restaurant called the Banti rooster opened just a you know, a few months before the pandemic to Great fanfare, a young woman and her partner came from Denver Colorado to bring what they considered authentic southwestern cuisine to New York City, particularly the village. They had great reviews the pandemic hit. They went to their landlord to try to seek a negotiation. Landlord basically told them to flip off. You know. Work harder is what the landlord told the entrepreneur who started the bantee rooster. You know what she's doing she's shutting down she's, going back to Denver, Colorado and she's, going to open her restaurant there she's, basically given up on New York, and we can't let that narrative win during this time. There's so many naysayers out there, not Jerry Seinfeld, but so many others yeah. We want to say that New York is over and and if the state of New York does not intercede, you know we're going to give them more grist for that very negative argument. None of us believe that, but we got to help our small businesses in the meantime, but so it's the mom- and- pop businesses, we're going to be losing it's the lifeblood of our city in communities, not just in New, York City, but acrosss. The state now the proposed- and this proposal to be very clear, is dependent on federal funding coming through and being dedicated to commercial relief. And what are we doing? I get asked to ensure that the funding comes through and is allocated occurring accordingly. Well, we have to like emphasize that the shared sacrifice between businesses, landlords and the government only works. If the state is able to provide funding to help offset the reduced rent, that tenants will be paying, I mean someone's got to pay. There is no such thing as a free lunch and for landlords, particularly small landlords. You know they they've got to put food on their table and they've got banks to answer to and their family owned businesses in many cases. So we can't be neglectful of that concern. We've been working, you know and urging our congressional representatives to stand strong in negotiations between the House and the Senate. I mean things are so highly politicized now to be very candid, I'm less I'm not less optimistic than I was just a few weeks ago as we're in the middle of you know the political season and you see the shots being fired tonight. You know I'm sure they'll come at the you know various political conventions, but even if we do receive federal funding, there's no guarantee that, without passage of the bill or similar proposals, there's one that's carried by my colleague, Senator Mike Gianaris, there's no guarantee that funds are going to be dedicated to rental relief. That's why these types of information sessions are so important to build. The kind of groundswell support, that's necessary now. What about businesses that have already closed or we're closed in the coming months? You know: are they going to be able to retroactively access this relief? We do not really know to be honest: there's no one size fits all assuming that we can get something like this passed in Albany, and you know, given the time crunch, that we have here, it's not clear, but the current the way the bill's currently drafted the bill would be deemed to be, in effect, as of March 7th 2020 the day that this Covid-19 state of emergency was signed by the governor. So what that would mean for an individual business and not for profit would be essentially factually dependent on when and to what extent they were impacted by the Covid-19 shutdown and other restrictions. We're getting you know great response from colleagues close sponsorships are, you know, we've only had a week or but we're getting some co- sponsorships, but there's a lot of interest, and I have on the phone with me both Sam Vasquez, who not only of course, as you know, is our legislative aide for Cb 6, but also helps us draft legislation along with Kendall Jacobson who's, our legislative director. So they can ask any specific technical questions you might have, but to be very candid, this late August kind of time frame is a difficult one for us. So that's why an outside push from you know, like from a resolution like yours, is crucial, so I'm really happy to spend time with you on this and really appreciate the fact that you're asking us to be here, but we do not know when that we do not know what the time frame is going to be and if we do meet, there's no guarantee that this is going to be on the docket. So by building legislative support we do two things. We generally elevate this. You know the issue of commercial rent relief among our legislative colleagues and leaders and two we provide our colleagues with some concrete proposals that we think can address the issue in a some equitable way. So, even if this bill itself does not pass or even if Assemblymember Carroll's bill itself does not pass, it's important that we get these issues. In the conversation I mean, and it's important- that bills represent the concerns of small business owners and the plight they face, because it's just so much more tangible and it gives us it gives us a point for advocacy, and so that's why you know. I think it's key that we continue to push these now there. There is a website around this issue called save our storefronts. You can just google that and there's they've done a great job, our friends at Cooper, Square, Committee, the tenant and small business advocacy organization down on the lower east side of Manhattan and they've collected supporters. They have a list of small businesses, they have stories, they have a video they've done a great job in beating the drum. So I have to give them credit for promoting this bill and making it a priority because it matters to them. There's a petition. There's a call script that you could use to call your legislators. There's a social media toolkit. They have hashtags an organizational endorsement, template letter that should you support it. You know CB6 can just borrow from if you wish and there's even there's another event that we're having soon on September 1st, where again we're going to be organizing around this bill with all the advocates under the Aegis of Cooper Square. So thank you so much happy to answer specific questions and again thanks to Kendall and Sam for being on the line and really appreciate you inviting me, that's my graduate thesis a plus just a couple of questions that just start off. I just Wanna get something all right. It was satisfactory so as we get some hands up, just have some. You know specific questions. I know it is explained a little bit in the bill, but just so that everyone can hear about it. So in terms of the lesser of twenty percent or the one-. Third, so just to reiterate, they would pay the landlord lesser of 20 of its revenue or one- third of the contractor will rent per month just wondering how were those calculations determined? Well, we we basically sought advice from small business advocates as to what was reasonable and and proceeded on that basis. And again, none of this is written in stone if a bill like this were to pass in Albany and frankly, somebody remember Carol's, we we'd expect to see some. You know negotiations pushback, right, Kendall's, okay, yeah Kendall or no, I guess it's the question just how was the level determined or yeah because is that? Is that too low? Is that too high just wondering where the twenty percent of revenue or one third of rent we got it from you know that was that was what we found was reasonable and you know we kind of based it on that determination from input from advocates, okay and then going to a point that you had made earlier about impacted landlords, because, as we know, some landlords are people who are being affected by this as well. It's not always the big corporate. You know landlord owners you had mentioned if the waving of the 20 or the one third you know, or the 20 or the one. Third, what resources are there for those landlords who are impacted by loss of income or any other? You know economic impact by this bill, yeah, I'm just going to say within the bill itself, the Department of Financial services is directed to establish a rent relief program for impacted landlords, so they provide, I believe, up to 500 million dollars in federal funding. So it would be in part, of course, reliant on the federal government to step up and provide New York States right. Thank you all right. Thank you all right. So I see two hands up, we'll start off with Dan Devine Hi Senator, Hoyle man. You know I've liked you, since I found out that you grew up in West Virginia really are you from West Virginia? No, but I was best man in a wedding and wheeling my friend grew up there. That's so interesting yeah. I grew up in a town so small that, in order to get the Federal Express guy to deliver to my house, I had to tell them to take a left at the barn on the dirt road that said, chew. Mail pouch tobacco treat yourself to the best. Yes great. I still have some moonshine that his cousin gave me. Oh, you should definitely maybe this is being transcribed so never mind. Oh okay, yeah I was going to yeah call your local police precinct. There may be some sort of amnesty for that. If you turn it. Thank you so I was. I was just curious when I know that this is sort of something that you want to do as an advocate yeah and you do not necessarily know if and when it could be passed. But what does it look like, potentially like best case scenario for this being negotiated past and maybe kind of money in the pockets, because I have a couple of friends who run businesses specifically restaurants in Manhattan and they're, not looking at what's happened several months ago, they're figuring out. Should I keep my business open next week? You know it's really hard question. We were asked that like do they you know, do they make a business decision on the anticipation of a bill like this passing, and I can't to be very candid I can not. I can not offer them that kind of the confidence that we're that we're going to pass. Something like this things are so volatile. The state's budget deficit is so enormous and the federal response has been so uneven that I think I'd it'd be irresponsible for me to say, yeah go for it. You know hold on out. I'm hopeful that again, as I kind of mentioned with the assembly member Carol's bill, the fact that we are being the fact that we are serious about a bill like this. I hope it brings landlords to the bargaining table so that your friends who own the restaurant have some leverage with their landlord or the landlord has some. You know hope that he or she can make some of what their losses are back, Kendall or Sam. What do you have to say to that yeah? You know, I think it's just a matter of putting a proposal out that, like the senator said, is intended to have some skin in the game for everybody's, because we're all struggling our struggles are shared. So you know, I think this is obviously dependent on a lot of things and the federal government coming through for us, but in the meantime you know we need to. I think recognize that so many are hurting and you know more are facing homelessness than ever before, and you know this is sorry and facing the loss of their businesses than ever before, and you know, I think, we're just encouraging everybody to come to the table, like the senator said, and to find solutions that you know, maybe were not something we would have seen before this, but this is an extraordinary time that requires extraordinary taxes. I know this might not necessarily be the most popular opinion, but my friends who own these establishments say the best thing that you can do is help them open help them open, meaning or dining. Oh yes, because if they have not gone out of business, yet it's a long leeway six months, nine months a year to get the money like they need the revenue now they need to pay their light bill. Absolutely I hear you on that. I hear you on that. I hope that they, you know, I hope that we extend outdoor dining for them. I hope that we, you know, are in a place that the public health experts can recommend indoor dining. I think you know I'm going to defer to the to the public health officials on that portion of it, but I think outdoor dining has been you know very successful. I know there have been issues around some neighbors and you know having a restaurant, a newly formed restaurant outside of your window has not always worked, but in most cases the response we've received, at least at the state level, as a senator has been very positive. So I am very much in agreement with your sentiment. Thank you. Dan. Next up we have John yeah. First of all, the senator. I totally support this. I think it's great. I have a comment, and that is this. I have a friend of mine, who's, fortunate enough to own several buildings and he's been working. You know out of his way to work with his tenants. So is there some that there could be some provision? You know for landlords that have been decent. You know, you know, as this is rolled out, I think would be, you know would be wise. You know he's been really bending over backwards with his tenants and then the question I have is- and I you might have already addressed this- and I did not flew by me. But what is the test for eligibility? I mean I'm assuming that you know this is not intended for the local starbucks or trade creed that might have lost some business over the last few months. Yeah, it's a it's a typical. It's a state standard, small business definition, okay and nonprofit, which in New York state, is one that has fewer than a hundred employees and is independently owned and operated, got it okay. Thank you, yeah, and I think the bill also specifically threw it through. It says, like 25 or fewer employees as well, yeah, okay, that rules out starbucks, okay, I'm sure that will be up for discussion too, but when you're back in Albany, so we further drill down is that is that right, kendall to twenty- five, just to clarify it's 25 or less employees currently yeah, I think technically, in New York state a small business is 100, but our bill goes further to 25. That's right! What does your average restaurant in New York have for employees? Good question? You know, I'm not sure that off the top of my head. That's a that's a good question. I'll certainly need to look that up. Oh, we do it yeah. This would affect the vast majority of restaurants in the in the city, and that was actually something that we had put in our in our resolution almost two years ago on the commercial rent control was that you know we wanted a defined definition of small business because I believe, like federal level is like 500 or less state is something like 100 or less and then obviously the city has different criteria for that. So yeah, that's something to keep in mind too Paige. I see your hand up as well. You have a question. Well, it's just a comment. I ordered dinner tonight from a place that I've been ordering since the epidemic and unfortunately it was going to be taken over, but I spoke to the fellow who was taking it over and said unless the and they are under 25 employees. Unless something is going to happen, we're going to reopen the insides of restaurants or they're going to come up some way they can make business they're going to have to close. They can't afford to stay open and it's because of the rent and also the lack of business. I mean takeout is one thing, but you really need if they reopen it, they won't have that many people in there you're going to be limited. You know yes, that social distancing is going to have enormous impact on their ability. To that. That's why the outdoor dining is going to be, you know, is going to be. You know, has given some of these restaurants a necessary lifeline, but it's a shame because this particular place has been in this neighborhood for over 30 years, which one is it it's. The bravest on was the 37th and second yeah. It's right on 38th, it's right, acrosss the street from me, but yeah, but it's a new ownership coming over. Well, actually, he has not officially taken it over because he said if things do not improve, why should he father to take it over he's taking it over from a relative yeah? And he you know it's a shame because I'd like to see it stay there, the food is decent and you know they're very new. Absolutely thank you for that page. So I do not see any more questions from the committee or any questions or comments from the public. Does anyone have a motion to make in support of Senator Hoyleman's bill? Save our storefronts yeah? I was I'd move. It is that you John yeah. So what is your motion in in support of Senator Oilman's bill, save our storefronts and who second that and that's secondary by Kevin? Okay, so cody? Can you do the roll call? Please? Okay, once again, committee members I'll call your name and just declare in favor against abstain or not entitled Kylo Thine in Favor Matt, Bondy, Okay, Dan Devine in favor. She needs an offrio in favor. Paige judge in favor. Youssef has not joined us John Keller in favor Kathleen Kelly in Favor, Anton Mallner. In Favor, Kevin O'keefe in favor see my Shaw abstain for cause not entitled Susan Steinberg in favor nine in favor, no against and one abstention for cause. That motion carries well. Thank you so much if I could just finish by saying I'm so appreciative of the support and want to thank again assemblymember epstein for his partnership in this yeah and thank you again, Senator Horliman and to your staff as well, particularly Sam and Kendall, for your great work and leadership on this and for being such great community. Advocates really appreciate that thanks pleasure, thanks guys. Okay, all the best enjoy your nights Brendan. Can we go back to the agenda? Please! Thank you. So again, in the same spirit of the last two agenda items, we have another presentation from the comptroller's office and they have their save main street initiative to help small businesses. So today we're joined by Adam Forman. Thank you for giving your time today and thank you for your work on this as well love to hear what you have to present to us. Thank you. So much Adam, I think you're on Mute yeah man. Thank you for having me and Adam foreman, I'm the chief policy and data officer with the also the comptroller. I focus a lot on economic policy, transportation policy and obviously this is the highest priority. Right now is saving small businesses, or at least one of the absolute major priorities. Hopefully some of you are able to look at the main street report. I think it was an analysis of a lot of things that we see walking down the street right now with all of us know our small businesses, our commercial core, our businesses are really struggling right now. You know the restaurants, the bars the nail salons, the barber shops. These businesses are under extraordinary financial pressure. We've already seen about 1300 restaurants, close a thousand retail businesses close. This is permanently you know. A lot of them are closed at the moment, we're teetering towards collapse and we can see worse outcomes as the winter enters, and this is not just about the businesses and the entrepreneurs in the community, but the employees themselves. 200,000 jobs have been lost in the restaurant businesses 71,000 in retail 36,000 in personal services, such an extraordinary loss of jobs and especially with the pandemic unemployment insurance lapsed. We're seeing people really struggle. Due to this, you know staggering unemployment, so the situation is dire and then the ppp loan was not enough. Only about 43 of New York City businesses main street commercial corridor, businesses actually received a ppp loan. You know those were not enough dollars in the first place and so few actually qualified for various reasons. You know the application process was a challenge in the beginning, in terms of connecting with banks, distrust of government that was actually to be forgivable, lack of information, lack of HR and accounting and financial support, whatever it might be. It's been a real challenge, so, with this in mind, with this backdrop, with this need to support our small businesses, because it's what makes our communities so vital, you know we. This is. This is where how we conceive of New York City and where we congregate with our neighbors. Our friends where we meet people is along our commercial corridors in our coffee shops and restaurants and bars in order to support these businesses and support our neighborhoods, we put together a pretty broad agenda: lots of pieces of New York City legislation, but some at the state level as well, that we've been pushing for and we'll talk about that a bit generally they fit in three buckets. First, is supporting existing businesses, ones that are struggling right now, getting money to them immediately for support. The second is heavy sport entrepreneurs, so we can fill a lot of those commercial vacancies that are were already quite prominent before this pandemic and now have really become quite a rash, and, lastly, is how do we invest in local neighborhoods, with the kind of sentiment that now it's one thing to say is shop local, but if people can't access their commercial corridors, if they can't spend time there for various reasons, because of accessibility issues for transportation issues, they can't shop local. So we need to think about investing in transportation and access and amenities in our commercial corridors. If we're going to make them more vital and more accessible, more vital, more accessible, so for the first bucket how we save existing businesses, some of these we've had progress on already and some we're still pushing for providing tax credits for independent businesses, particularly the business income tax credit to help with reopening expenses allow businesses a cure period when for addressing and fixing violations, you know, rather than finding them immediately, we've seen pretty aggressive action by the SLA to find businesses. We think, that's you know most cases pretty counter productive. We need to be working with businesses, not hurting them, and this goes against the whole gamut of dohmh and DOB fines. I think this is not just now but permanently. We need you thinking about how people can address it and resolve their violations, not find them another. One is permanently capping the fees on the grub hubs, the third party deliveries and then providing legal assistance for businesses that are having rental disputes, and that was already actually, the council has taken that up the mayor's reinstituted the program and City Council's going to be funding it. So we're pretty excited to see that that's been taken up and businesses who are in negotiation with our landlords can actually get that legal support, and then it goes to boosting entrepreneurship, which is going to be a real. This is this is not just the now, but for several years, so we're going to unfortunately see a lot of these vacancies and we need to address that as quickly as possible. I think the biggest one we talked about is just waiving permitting inspection fees for the next 10 months. You know want to create this rush to open up businesses now when it's actually cheaper than ever to reopen businesses. So once the pandemic is over, having a 10 month period of waiving inspection fees and permitting fees to really incentivize business, to open up immediately expediting launching of businesses, we think is really crucial not going to DLB and dohmh and DCA, but having a one- stop shop. They do this with restaurants to an extent. This should be for everybody comprehensive inventory of vacancies so that, if you're a potential business owner, you can look and see which businesses commercial spots are vacant. What their and then, what I'm seeing a scroll through and then you know, I'm helping them, connect it and find locations, and then, finally, okay and two more on that front. One is the tax incentives in commercial corridors. You know where there are high vacancies to incentivize folks to reopen and then an important one. We think which we've pushed in the past is a re- entrepreneurship program. You know about 50 of small businesses are owned by people who are 55 years old. You know they're going to retire and a lot of those businesses, especially now, when you know the hassle of this pandemic, the frustration and those businesses just going to disappear, even ones who are profitable ones, who have suppliers, someone who have an existing business so think about re- entrepreneurship programs that they do in montreal and also in Barcelona, where you think about finding potential re- entrepreneurs who would inherit those businesses. You know where they do not have a family, member or a partner who would take over that business so connecting aspiring business owners to existing businesses? That are, you know, community pillars and are still quite profitable and then, lastly, is the investing in neighborhoods. You know talk about what I said before, where we need to make neighborhoods accessible, whether it's investments in bike lanes and bus lanes. Some people can get to their businesses, commercial quarters, accessible to young families and the elderly, and everyone else you know with that's been curb cuts and street seating and public bathrooms and bus shelters on our commercial corridors. People can spend time there and get commercial floors and then repurposing street space for restaurants, which we're doing now, but also for retail and other community uses making use of our street space so that we can help businesses right now so yeah, that's those that's the core pillars of our report. We've had some success in pushing for, as I said, legal assistance for businesses we're going to negotiate discussion about opening street space for some retail we've been talking with the bid association. Who's really been pushing for that. So we're continuing to push this agenda, but we think it's something that's for now and for the years to come. This is, you know, a way to kind of re- envision our commercial corridors and small businesses both now and in the future. Awesome. Thank you. So much again. If anyone from the committee has questions, please raise your hand just to get things started off Adam. One of the things that I noticed about this report compared to some of the other bills that we've seen is that it does not, at least to me, appear to be based on any big federal funding request or anything. You know really, aside from that, can you describe if there are? If this is more about, you know, policy changes and you know reshaping things based on. You know making systems and processes more efficient, or is it more there's going to be a request of the basic all this is going to be based on a state budget city budget at a later point yeah, and we tried to really focus on what the city can do, what the city can do now. You know what happens at the in Congress is out of our hands. It's extremely frustrating. We've been pushing for federal, more federal support, we're in constant communication with Jerry, Nadler and other folks in Washington, but we realize that there is a log jam, and so we need to focus on what we can do. You know waving the 25 liquor license fee for restaurants and bars like that's something we can do now. It's not a big revenue driver, but it's something. That's a burden for restaurants and for bars expanding some of that. You know one stop shop for opening up a business and waiving fees for opening a business. So these are things we can do really quickly allowing retail space so yeah, so that was that was very much. The intention was to think about what the city can do and to lesser extent, what the state can do. One thing we do talk about is the ppp loan. You know right now, it is it's lapsed, but there was 150,130 to 150 billion dollars still in it, there's a chance that it actually could be renewed and, as we mentioned, only 43 of commercial corridor. Small businesses applied for it. So if that is renewed, which we think there's a chance, if anything is going to renewed, it's going to be that one. We really want to do work with bids work with other community affairs organizations within this within the mayor's office and with Comptroller's office as well, and go store to store business to business and getting folks to sign up for that. Ppp loan, like it's, 150 billion, was left on the table. A lot of small businesses did not take advantage and we need to. We need to get that money. Awesome. Thank you. So, let's go to Matt Bondi first. Thank you Kyle, forgive me, but I scrolled. I tried to catch as quickly as I could some of the recommendations there, but one that struck me or stuck out in my mind, was the ban on expediters at the DOB and I'm curious. What the thinking is behind that is it because it's a bar, you know hiring an expediter is a bar to some small businesses. I think it's less like banning. Is it not allowing them and more, as in those experts should be in the DOB? We should be making things so quick, so you do not need an expediter. I think it is the logic there. You know it's a testament to how you know slow. Our bureaucracy is, and the lack of coordination between the agencies and the DOB is actually even better to extend on making digital submissions easier, but we're still seeing a very slow system that we need liaisons and advocates within city government to make that process move faster. All right. Thank you and we've seen this. In other places I mean San, Francisco and Los Angeles have made decent progress in San Francisco. They have a single digital portal, where you can get all the documentation for applying for a business, and you can submit that occupation, acrosss different agencies and city state Federal in Los Angeles. They do have like a single point of entry expediters for businesses, so you do not need to go to 10 different agencies, so we've seen progress in other places. It's not perfect, but it's time for New York City to pick up the slack as well. Thank you all right, Dan you're up yeah Adam. Thank you. I know, as Matt said, there's a lot definitely to go through there, so I appreciate everything that your office is doing and I actually really like the reports that you come out with you guys appreciate it. I honestly I mean we hear from a lot of elected officials, but it's one office that I do feel like is really trying to be forward thinking and looking for data which I love, but and that Madam that is actually really high praise coming from Dan. Who is the you know, Committee Contrarian, I'm sorry I like it, but one thing, though, of all of the things that just stuck out to me that I'd, maybe ask you guys to reconsider, is the idea of capping the percentage that the delivery services take because, first of all, it's onerous? It's terrible. I call up directly right. I do not do because I know how horrible it is for those businesses. So if I could reimagine it- and I think your office should as well is instead of capping the amount that they're taking down from 30 to 20 percent, why do not you reimagine it and give transparency to the consumer so allow the business to charge 30 extra if you go through grubhub versus, if you call up, because it's better for the business that way, you're, actually saving them more versus just trying to you know limit a startup company yeah. It's interesting. You say that actually talking to a bunch of businesses in my area and the city of five boroughs, this there was actually a somewhat of a pause for a couple months when businesses were closed down in March and April, where you saw them get new. You know relationships with new delivery companies looking for lower rates or for reservation companies making reservations. You know businesses are living day to day and they'll take the first company that approaches them, whereas when they had this time to actually like shop the market and look for the best rates they took advantage in this period, which hopefully is beneficial in the long term. So I think to your point, being more transparent about the services that are available and what their rates are could go a really long way so they're making those decisions day to day and not just when there's this very unfortunate two- month plus. So I think that the point is very well taken. Well, I mean it's the same thing as a credit card company. Now that a small business has the ability to charge you extra if you use American Express yeah, so I'm when I see that- and I understand that I'm more likely to pay cash, and I think it's the exact same thing. Consumers are more informed. Businesses are better off and I just think it's much better for everyone involved. Yeah. I'm actually interested to hear your perspective on this, and I'm opening up to all of you know one of the hospitality, not alliance, but hospitality coalition has been pushing for allowing restaurants to charge a copa, 19 surcharge, that's not allowed by the department of consumer affairs, but a five percent surcharge so that they can, you know, increase their revenues cover some of the major losses you know. Does that make folks uncomfortable yeah, so we actually wrote yeah, so we actually wrote a bill about this article bill a a resolution on this the other month. I think it was like in June or July, because we had started seeing this actually pop up in other areas of the country where they were calling it like a Covid-19 surcharge and so for us what we the issue that we actually had with that, because I think, at the end of the day we all want to support businesses, especially like in our local. You know, neighborhoods one of the things that we actually the purpose behind the bill was more of like consumer protection. We wanted to make sure that these surcharges were public, that you know things were not you know increasing and that you know or you purchase something and then all of a sudden you sell on the bill. You know like you're, being charged the surcharge. Many of us would probably honestly pay it, but the idea of not being educated about that before purchasing a good or service was the issue that we had. So we put something out mostly just about being sure that was transparent and did not honestly have strong feelings about the charge itself, because I think, in that case much to Dan's point was as a consumer once you're educated about that you can make your own financial decision about it to say, hey, you know what I do not like this, I'm going to move and get my coffee somewhere else or like okay, I get it we're all trying to you know, get back and make sure that you know New York City gets back to where it was and yeah I can. You know, put in a little bit of that. It's kind of like with some of these third- party apps. They give you the option to like round up your bill and that you know remaining goes to like Covid-19 relief or whatever it is. So the fact that you have the option to say: oh, you know I want to do that or I do not want to participate in that. You know it's great and I always do that. Every time I you know, purchase something online. I say yeah I'll. You know round up and donate the difference to Covid-19, but I was appreciative that I knew about that before them. Just rounding it up for me, so we had something about that, but yeah for the rest of the committee. Does anyone have feelings about like the charge itself, like we already put something out about consumer protection to make sure that we're educated about it? But I guess Adam's point is more to like how do you feel about it itself? Matt, I think I see you yeah. I do not think there should be Covid-19 surcharges. Restaurants are struggling, people are struggling all over the city and that, to the extent that you part of our thinking was that it not only should it be transparent and but you should know in advance before you go so you can decide whether or not to incur charge like that, but that it should be directly related to any increase that an establishment is forced to bear because of protections for the consumer, like we were speaking about this in the context dentist's office and the need for them to clean in between each visit and to provide masks and things of that nature. So so, when we discussed this, we thought that it was important that it not only be made clear in advance that there was such a fee. I personally objected to the fees at all, and I said: if there have to be fees, then they should be known in advance and directly related to an increased in or an expense that was directly attributable to protecting the consumer and the people that work at the establishment. So I'm personally against charging any kind of Covid-19 type of surcharge. But if you do, it should be directly related to the increased cost brought to bear on the establishment gotcha. Yes, I do not want to divert the conversation, but I was interested to hear what you guys thought. That's really helpful. No, that's definitely a great you know topic for a more in- depth conversation at another point too seema you're up, hey Adam. I just wanted to say hi because good I mean you know our paths crossed when I worked at Laguardia, I'm actually now at the state and there's the flurry of dinner activity dinner, making activity behind me, but otherwise, I would definitely say hi and I'll drop. You a note as well, but I'm just curious, I'm at the state now and it's kind of piggybacking off Kyle's initial question or you know, after your presentation are there. You know, I saw the note about the long island, railroad and the MTA and potentially lowering some of the pay walls around that. Are there other kind of state oriented? You know within the context- and I know that there's like you said you know 27 or something points but other state level, yeah implications that you can kind of share at a high level and I'll be happy to go through all of it myself. Yeah I'd have to go through all them to have a full litany, but the two that I recall off top of my head, one, is on the business tax credit, providing a credit for the business income tax to go towards reopening expenses which might be ppp equipment and outdoor dining and any other expenses that would need state approval that business income tax credit for small businesses, which we call businesses under five million dollars of revenue. There was a question about what defined, how we'd find a small business, so that would take state legislation, there's a similar business income tax credit for health science, businesses, so there's a precedent for at the state level and then the other one. Oh, the SLA, you know in terms of just you know it's a it's a difficult situation in terms of enforcing social distancing but they're, obviously, they've been very aggressive at the state at the city level. You know, we think not having the the food requirement when you sit down is rolling. That back is a will, be a positive development and also just extending permanently the getting alcohol to go. You know this is not just going to be for the pandemic, but for a long time business to recruit their their dollars. So allowing that to be a long- term reform. We think it is important that could be done by executive order. There was one other one: oh yeah, the last one was using snap benefits towards restaurants, so that was actually allowed by congressional legislation that certain seniors and those with disabilities, who might not have access to kitchens or might have more difficulty preparing food for themselves, could use their snack benefits, not just at grocery stores, but also at restaurants and New. York state has not allowed that a couple other states have taken up the congressional allowance on that. So we think that's another pathway, something to help restaurants and to also help folks, who are pretty isolated right now with this pandemic and might not have helped with with cooking and with accessing grocery stores that they can use those food stamps for our snack benefits. Sorry for at restaurants, that's really helpful. Thank you. Thank you. I also want to invite Jim collins from the public who has a question or comment. Rather, this goes to another point that we brought up earlier in the summer about third- party apps, showing businesses as closed when they're. Not so, we voted on it early in the summer to make sure that you know the party apps were not doing that. Obviously we're going to bring it to the full board in September, but can we get Jim to just speak a little bit sure? Can you hear me yep? Okay? I just wanted to raise it again and we had discussed it as was mentioned earlier before our summer hiatus, but there are a number of restaurants where they were members of one of the delivery apps and for whatever reason, the relationship ended and the delivery apps are continuing to hold the business basically hostage on the internet and saying that they're closed when they're, not so. In other words, if you wanted to call them up and get a delivery from them, you were more than capable of doing so. But if you, if you went to the internet and googled them- and you would you would assume that they were closed, so I'm just wondering if maybe the comptroller might want to yeah some notes on that. No, that's! Actually! That's really just actually a statement measure. That's totally unacceptable. It's apparently happened in a few other states. We discussed it as I said prior to their our summer hiatus, but it is an issue and it's particularly tough on the very small guys who you know are trying to maintain their business during the in their delivery business during the pandemic, and they can't do it. So that's really capping a surcharge. Pardon me more important than taking a certain reducing the amount that app can charge yeah. I would, I would think so I would think so. You know my deli down the hall down the street, rather that I've been using you know for 40 years was shown as closed by his former deliver delivery. App, please yeah! Let me I'm going to in my provide my email and the messages. If I can, because please send that to me because that's an issue we should, we should follow up on I'll, follow up with you guys and provide my email, okay, I think we have a resolution on it or we have one in your left yeah, so we had voted on it. We can send it over, but obviously we have to bring it before the full board in September. So that's when we'll discuss that yeah, that's great okay, Jeannie! I see your hand up yeah, just so just a quick comment on that. I do not know if it's been reported in something like eater. You know like keep on trying if your restaurant is listed as clothes contact them directly and explain why I just do not know if it's just something people just you know. I do not really know how widespread this information is. A small deli does not have a chance yeah right and actually, I might have to jump off. I have to help my wife playing together, so let me so yeah so we're. Actually I do not see any other new questions. So does anyone want to make a motion on this to support this plan put forth by the comptroller? Are those I see him? Okay, Paige? Are you trying to say something I'm trying to, but I can't get my thing to say raise my hand, I would like to make a motion to support the actual controller's document. You know I'm sorry, the mainstream. All right is that seconded by anyone. I can. Second, it all right. Seconded by Genie cody, could you go through the roll call?

We appreciate that yeah. Thank you. So much for having me have a great night, yeah you too and Brendan. Can we go back to the agenda? Please yep, all right, so we have two applicants who are here with us today who are applying for new licenses. So the first one that we have up is coyote ugly saloon, which is moving to 233 East 14th street. So for those who are new, I know we have not done applications in a while, so just to be on the same page, all of the applicants were here on behalf of their application. We're going to meet you please introduce yourself to the committee and, of course, to anyone from the public who is attending. Please state your name, your relationship to the application and to the establishment, and then please run through the application that you're applying for so go through the you know a little bit of your professional background, the concept of the establishment and we'll go from there, and if anyone has any questions from the public or the committee again, as always, please do raise your hand and submit comments through the Q&And, a function and we'll go through those kyle. Just a reminder I sent in I put in the chat for the committee members a link where they can view each of the applicants, 30-day notices and submitted questionnaires. Thank you, kyle all right, so, first all go ahead. Great! It's good to see you again likewise and thank you kyle and good evening, CB6, it's nice to see everyone again, virtual as it may be. Some of you may know me. I do see some new faces here as well. My name is Max Bookman, I'm an attorney, my firm represents bars and restaurants and alcohol licensing matters throughout the state and the city I'm regularly before this board. Before I talk about coyote ugly, which I'm here to talk about tonight, I just wanted to spend 60 seconds or so wearing the other hat that I wear, which is counsel to the New York City Hospitality Alliance, our industry trade association here in the city that represents over 2,000 bars and restaurants, and I just on behalf of the alliance, I want to applaud you for the conversation that you just had over the past three agenda items. You know I get to go to many community board meetings, not just representing applicants but representing the alliance and the degree of seriousness and sophistication with which you have approached these issues facing bars and restaurants. With the speakers that you've invited to discuss to the committee members tonight is really exemplary and on behalf of the alliance, we really thank you for that and for your resolutions that you all passed tonight and voted on almost unanimously supporting the business interruption, insurance bill, the state of our storefronts Bill, Controller, Scott, Stringer, and all the great work that he's doing on behalf of small businesses. You know the alliance we work with all of these elected officials and more including folks at the State, Liquor Authority and the governor's office and we've started. You know we've been doing this for over six years, but you know with Covid-19. It's really been kicking into high gear. Our bars and restaurants are at a crisis point and we're really glad to see the members of this committee at least are recognizing that- and you know this in particular, there's some really good questions that that I was silently applauding when I was listening. Dan devine, you had some good questions about why in New York City can we not have indoor dining when we've met the same exact metrics as the rest of the state has for phase four reopening, yet New York City? We can't have indoor dining and the rest of the city. Can you know there was some talk about outdoor dining and if you're you know walking through the streets of the city, you see a lot of outdoor dining. Now there's been expanded outdoor dining. The alliance was behind the scenes developing that program, but outdoor dining was really just supposed to be a band- aid to help bars and restaurants bridge the gap until indoor dining and you know even the largest outdoor dining areas. You know what 20 something seats. I mean that's really nothing compared to indoor dining and right now there is zero plan from the governor zero plan from the mayor about when we are going to have indoor dining again, it's been safe in the rest of the state, so these are issues that the alliance is constantly working on and if any of you want to talk to me about it, offline I'd be happy to because we really do appreciate the focus that that I saw tonight so switching gears from where I am you're. So you stole my new business report from later in the meeting, so please stick around after, because I'm bringing up actually indoor dining today. So please stick on for that. Thank you, Kyle. Well, so then switching gears, then from wearing that hat to the hat that I wore here tonight, which is representing coyote ugly. I think, given the conversation that you all just had this is this application is really fits the topic, because what we have here is a New, York, City, Institution and so just to introduce who's. Here tonight we have Liliana Lovell. She was one of the folks who turned her camera on earlier and was talking with the assemblyman about the issues that she's facing. She is the founder and CEO of Coyote ugly. It's that coyote ugly, the one that opened on first avenue between ninth and tenth over 27 years ago. She started it as a as a young entrepreneur in the year or right around the year 2000. Actually I think earlier than that, she'll correct me. If I'm wrong 1993. 93 2000 was the movie it started in 1993. She has an amazing story. You could read about her online, but you know the and the highlights of it are. She realized that as a bartender, she was making a lot more money per night than I said she was at her internship, so she started off. You know she moved into being a bartender and then created her own business. That business took off. The movie was made in the year 2000 and since then, there she has opened other coyote uglies around the city. Excuse me around the country and around the world. There are over 20 coyote uglies now, all throughout the world. Internationally, but this one in New York is the first one. It was the original one and it's a place that has not only been dear to her but been dear to patrons and people who've lived in the neighborhood for almost three decades and the reason why it's important to bring that coyote ugly is topical tonight is because Ileana and her business have been drastically and negatively impacted by Covid-19 and the impacts of it. They are not open, you know they have a, they are really a bar and they always have been, and their sort of method of operation is not it's, not an outdoor type of method of operation or not exclusively outdoors, so they've not been open, and you know, without getting into too many of the details. Ileana will get into more if she feels like it, but they're having trouble with their landlord like so many other people are and they're in a position now where they are forced to find a new home for their business. That's been in the community, just south of the southern border of your community. You know, which has been their home for many years. They've they've now been forced to find a new one and they've found one, and it's right, like I said right on the southern border of your community district, is on the north side of 14th street between second and third, it's a place that used to be a bar for many years. It was called the blind pig, so she's looking to replace a bar with another bar, but of course it's not just any other bar. This is a bar that is a neighborhood New York institution. It's been around for three decades and we hope that will be around for many years to come. So she's here, I'm here we have the team. Here. We've submitted our questionnaire to you. We are happy to answer any questions that you have, but we really do hope that we can have your support tonight so that this important business can continue. Awesome. Thank you and I'm sorry, and just before I cut you off Kyle, just one more thing very briefly before you. If there are any questions before anyone asks them, I just wanted my client herself just to just to say hello and just say a few times. Well, honestly, you know I knew a few years ago. We would probably have to move, but now, all of a sudden, with Covid-19 it's put so much pressure on our business. We have not been able to open the landlord we've been closed since March 16th. The landlord is giving us no reprieve on rent so we're in a position where this is it. You know that bar on 153, first Avenue will never open again and I'm about to tear up thinking about it, because that was my first bar at 25 years old. But what I ca, what can I do? You know we receive ppp loans at 70,000, that's gone. We got declined for our disaster loans, so that's does not exist. The landlord, if you go by First Avenue they've, been doing construction on the building actually pre- covered, so we're not even in we're not even able to open because of the construction. Yet they're asking for 80 percent rent and our rent was 25 000.. So that's just done just we can't do it we're done there. So we went out, we started looking and we found this spot. We love it and you know we're long- time. Operators. This is a place that, in my mind, will be open another 30 years. So that hope is that we go on 14 14th street, and you know we turn that into our home. The beauty. Now the difference. Now that I'm in my 50s versus 25 years old is I've got a little bit more money, we're going to put a kitchen in it's going to be a little bit nicer. I was just telling my son earlier that it's actually three blocks away from where he was born because he was born in at Beth Israel. So you know just want to make this our new home. Thank you so much for that, and just before we get to the questions you know. I know this is like a bittersweet moment for you know, because that is the original location. That was where you became the person you became to be, but at the same time we're happy that you looked at our district. You know to make your new home, and so we're excited to you know, to work together and to make sure that you know hearing you call it home is really great for us because for all of us, obviously this is our home and our you know our business operators are our people. You know they're part of the family and, as you've heard from all the conversations we've had earlier tonight about making sure that business owners, small and then larger as well, are getting the protection and support that they need and actually I'm familiar with, the bar even before it was probably you know appropriate for me to know about the bar. I was. I was two years old when you, when you started that in 1993- and you know from the neighborhood and was part of the boys Club on timpani, so very close by and so actually I was biking around the neighborhoods just to check out how everything was going and I saw that the location was closed and did not know what was going on with that. So to see your application was really heartening, and so part of you know this. This process is obviously we want to support businesses. We also want to make sure that we want to support the comfort and safety of residents and community members, and so obviously you've had an extensive career in operating the coyote ugly, not only in New York City, but throughout the country in the world. So a couple of questions that we have particularly about this block is everyone can see the block a lot more residential than your previous location. So in terms of noise level- and I know you put some of this in the application, but we also want to make sure that people from the public can hear about this in terms of noise crowd, Control security. All of that, obviously, the number one complaint that we always get is noise and then not being able to walk in through their front door or not feeling safe, because people are congregating or you know doing whatever. It is obviously that'll look a little different now because we're in a covered world. But what are some of the you know? Precautions that you were you know taking for this location to make sure that any disruption is, you know as minimal as possible. I could just before Liliana answers your question. If I could just just frame it and then let her get into the details, you're absolutely right that that the comfort of neighbors is extremely important. One of the reasons why she found this location appropriate is that, yes, it is more residential, but it is on 14th street, which has a nice wide sidewalk. It is it's not, you know, 15th, Street or 16th street, which is much smaller, and she also found a location that its immediate previous use for as far back as we could tell at least 10 years was a bar that although, and we asked your office, you know if you had stipulations going back that far with the blind pig, but people were working remotely. I know cody and brennan are doing their best. We, you know we could not get those that's okay, but from what we could tell on yelp- and you know this community probably knows better. That bar was, you know, was a late night bar. So you know the idea was not to replace you know with dry cleaners with a coyote ugly. It was to replace something that already had that use, which you know we know, is important to this board and the neighbors for the right reasons. So that's just a general comment, but I will let Liliana get into the deep. These are the operational details of how she plans to operate this bar in a in a respectful manner. Well, you know. Obviously, I've been in New York. I we signed the lease on first avenue in November. It will be 28 years again a little bit different. I was 25 years old and broke now, I'm in my 50s I actually put on the call and, if he's still listening, I had my construction person come on because I wanted him. I knew that noise would be something that we want to talk about, so have him on. If you want him to speak about some of the sound pro proofing, we would do so. Let me see if I can get them on Kevin. Can you hear me? I can you hear me? Yes, oh excellent, hello, everyone. My name is Kevin Bailey, I'm the director of design and development for our development corporation. So noise ordnance issues are nothing new to us. We often times go into similar situations, so it's hard to say without physically being in the building, we're in unprecedented circumstances here with Covid-19, but typically through certain specialized construction materials, acoustical dampening materials. In most cases we can bring our sound pressure level from we're right. We hover around 100 db. We can bring down to achieve maybe 75 decibels through, like mass loaded, vinyl, transducers, quiet rock there's a litany of products on the market today that we can encapsulate the parcel with also just to mention that you know we run on a jukebox and iphone. So we're not a very we're a regular bar. We do not have you know. I know the movie can kind of make people think one way, but the reality is we run a jukebox and then we'll have my ipod plugged in and so we're really not any louder than a regular bar would be. But yes, people like Kevin go and help us make sure that we're doing the right thing for the neighbors. Absolutely I mean I mean you know what my philosophy for our committee is always about being proactive, because you know we want to make sure that you can call this home for many years to come, and you know the number one thing that we always see is that people were not proactive in addressing concerns from the neighbors, and so that's one of the reasons we always ask. These questions is to make sure you know that we're thinking about these things and that you know we do not get to a situation where people are calling 3-, 1- 1, and all of that, because we want to make sure that you know that this is a great place for a business to thrive and, at the same time, a great place to live. So in terms of that, if one of the things that we ask for all operators is that to again to ensure that we're being proactive and that we avoid you know, any sort of conflict is to also have you know, whoever the general manager is on site to have the information perfect see you're prepared. This is great. I want us to be part of the neighborhood. You know when I opened the other car. I lived a half a block away for 10:15 years, so I've. Actually, my guilty pleasure recently has been going on the apartment searches to find apartments right in the neighborhood. So you know it's home. You know I was born and raised in New York, and you know those are our people and our regulars live there. They do not live very far from you know where the other coyote was, and so we want to be happy there. We want for our next door neighbor to come, you know and bring our security guard a coffee. You know because they know each other, like that's part of kind of the culture that we like to bring to wherever we open and kyle. If I could, if I could just add to that, you know, even though this has the feel of a regular bar just like Liliana said, I mean they are very at this point in time. In this business's lifetime they have become very professional and streamlined. I mean they have a whole team now and it's standard operating procedure for them in whatever city they're in to have a general manager who is who has a phone number that's available to neighbors? You know to the extent that there are any issues that they could connect. The general manager for the First Avenue location is here tonight. I do not think she necessarily needs to speak at this moment, but she is here: paula she's in the Gm for many years, the folks down in CB3 in the district, where they're currently in have her number and she, if we're fortunate enough to get your approval and are able to move into this new location, she'll be the general manager there as well, and it was already in the plan to to offer our phone number make it available, and we could do that in any way that you'd like yeah to me. Actually, you know the diver the better, but we just want to make sure that you know that there's some signing, I'm going to tell you right now, do not expect the old coyote is one's going to be nice. I've got, I already have a menu submitted, so not the same one, the same people, new beginnings, new beginnings, yeah, but yeah. We want to make sure that you know there are signs encouraging people to be respectful of their neighbors, whether it's you know smoking or sanitation, or you know, noise of course, and also that there's a number that the residents can reach for someone who's on site in case they do have complaints so that they're calling you directly instead of calling you know the police or 301, because often times what we see is if there was just communication between the establishment and the residents, that thing would have been done in a couple of seconds instead of escalating. So we just want to make sure that we have that signage out there as well. But to get to the questions I want to start off with Susan and then we'll go to Dan yeah. I have a very easy question: how many I'm assuming you're going to have tables and chairs outside? I was just wondering how many so Susan. Let me just let me field that question since I'm dealing with it. So you know it's an unusual time as an attorney who deals with city agencies right now, especially with sidewalk cafes. You know as part of the alliance, we were part of the group that helped develop the current temporary D.O.T outdoor seating program and that's been very successful and a helpful lifeline for bars and restaurants. But one of the consequences of that has been that the department of consumer affairs, which I know you know Susan- is responsible for licensing sidewalk cafes in the city, they've actually taken the position that they're no longer accepting sidewalk cafe, license applications and they're not going to be again until the temp. The D.O.T temporary outdoor seating program ends, which is currently slated for October 31st, but we've heard all sorts of rumblings behind the scenes and publicly that it's going to be extended later this year and perhaps even into next year, and who knows beyond that? So the reason I say that is, there are different programs with one has a much more forgiving or lenient seating ability. The D.O.T program than the side, the DCA sidewalk cafe program- does we're in early stages of hiring an architect to do a DCA, compliant sidewalk cafe plan. So we can get a number of tables and shares for when DCA does start accepting sidewalk cafe applications again, but you know we do not have that now, but obviously we're going to want to have as many as we're legally allowed to and for the duration of Covid-19. You know keeping it so that it's appropriately socially distanced. I do not know I got it. I got it next up, Dan yeah. Can you hear me? Yes, okay, yeah this is. I really appreciate this because I think the fact that you're opening what you're opening with the franchises throughout the world, in fact, but you also represent sort of an iconic New York City establishment, I'm just curious for Liliana in terms of everything that you've done over the years, starting a New, York, City establishment and then obviously getting you know famous because of the eat, love pray, woman right to then be able to build basically an incredible business globally. How do you think about the things that are being proposed that you've heard tonight in terms of you know to save businesses both on the small scale, as well as in terms of bigger scale and like the landlords and kind of negotiating things and from a bigger corporate perspective? Is there a difference that you see, or is it still all the same? I well so just you understand so my company, all these bars are separate llc's. So just so, you get a scope of it. The New York Bar received its ppp loan. That was seventy thousand dollars. That's gone. Seventy thousand dollars our rent was twenty five thousand dollars. We have taxes, manager, salaries, Insurance health insurance, so we're talking about such a small amount of money that was supposed to represent one to two months of being closed being closed six months that just I do not know anybody who was able to let that money last this long, so you know for coyote ugly. Every single bar around the around the world is all a separate little company we've had to close our San Diego bar down because same issue as New York, a landlord that was unwilling to negotiate with us. There's just no way to pay these kind of rents and be able to be closed for six months. We got declined for our disaster loan. We do not know why that we got declined. The answers we've got is that well we're really busy try again and try to re. You know activate your loan if the whole system has been awful and honestly, the only country that I've seen with coyote ugly, that's just as bad as us has been the Uk. Everybody else seems to have helped both sides helped the business owner and helped the landlords. Here we do not seem to have. I do not feel like. I have any rights right now: no rights, the landlord at 153. First Avenue, he stopped communicating like he wants his money. He won't even take my calls or emails. I had to hire a lawyer he's not even responding to the lawyer so we're while I can still probably walk in the door of the bar. Essentially he's made a non- verbal, please say: he's we're done we're evicted. So it's just it's absolutely heartbreaking. What's going on everything that was done was very short. I would say that for me, I because I am around the country in the world. I have access to more people. I spend more time during the day making phone calls to advisors. Hey. Can you help me? You know we do not know what we're doing you know when you guys were talking about the insurance. We had pandemic insurance, we're not getting paid out, so it's like who can help us who can guide us accountants? What should we be using this money? For? What you know is this forgiven? Is that not, then you get the disaster loans, which are not forgiven they're alone. This has been absolutely nightmarish and I do not know in places like New York, where the rents are so high. I do not see how you know. I was listening to the senator and these are nice words, but the reality is without immediate action. These plays are closing down and my understanding, according to the law, is that at the end of September, the tenants start losing some of their power, so that will go back to the landlords and you're going to see more places. Closing I think if they were not able to reopen they'll start closing more places in October. Thank you. It's heartbreaking, yeah, but that's why we appreciate your input and why we're here tonight, Kevin you're up yes and miss level. I applaud all of your achievements and I really love hearing about your passion. My question is just really quick. I happen to know somebody who lives next door with a family. Are there any plans for Djs Post Covid-19? No, we're not a dj place. We do jukebox and we put the ipod on and just from a legal perspective. That's not going that's not part of our notice to you and it's not part of our application to the liquor authority. So no djs, we do country and rock music. We have the jukebox it's just. It's not that type of place. Thank you. Thank you all right, Eugenie hi. Thanks for the presentation, just a few questions, the menu. What kind of menu are you offering? Will you be offering? Well I'm doing an homage to my mother, I'm colombian, so I have decided to do a colombian tapas menu, so we're going to do a Repa's and empanadas and platinos, but it's going to be tapas style. We are a bar and honestly we're not really known for food. So I want it to be small. Bites, okay, cool thanks. Will you bring any of your decor from the old place to the new? Well we're trying to sneak it out now because they have not been letting us in, but I know what the honesty got. Truth is the stuff I want are the pictures yeah, that's 28 years worth of memories, and that's what I want. Well, you have a lot of fans. My family was here last year and it's like that's probably one of the last establishments that they went into before they left New York City, and we had a great time- and maybe I do not know what your relationship is with Piper Parabola, but it'll be nice if it is a good relationship that she supports, you she's an activist she used to come during the daytime, like she loved to come like Sunday Day, come at like two o'clock in the afternoon, but I have not seen her in years, she's been pretty active with what's going on with social equality, and I do not know. I would think this is some. This is something she might want to help out with yeah, maybe I'll reach out to her. That's a good idea. Okay! Thank you all right. Thank you. Genie. Are there any more questions or comments from the committee? All right, I'm seeing none. Are there any questions or comments? Yes, I want to just say something: yeah go ahead. Sorry, I did not see your hand up. So I do not know do not worry about. My video was not on, but you probably recognize me, but I do know a little too much about your place myself from being a 21 year old about 1993, and I can recall some fond memories that I had there as a young man in college, a true neighborhood place. You know a New York City Cultural Institution, and I can't think of something more appropriate at this time than to support you and your establishment. I remember being surprised to be in your bathroom, but this is part of what made your place so special that they were not in the stall. There was no toilet. You know there was like a pipe in the ground and I was like wow. You know this is a real spot or lower east side kind of spot, and it was just really great. I remember you know people asking for water and being yelled at, for example. So do not do that anymore? Oh, you do not do that anymore. This is a little bit different. What was her name Jackie used to yell at me from down there anyway. So, yes, thank you for staying in the neighborhood. I you know, I think it's the kind of place that I you know, you'll definitely be a part of and responsive to community concerns. So good luck with your new place and again I mean I plan on getting an apartment. Probably right around the corner, not too close to the manager can call me all the time, but right around all right. Well, anyways, it's nice to see you here, matt, it's it matt, it's nice to see you and thank you for that comment. Thank you Max! You too. Yes, all right all right! So seeing no more questions or comments from the committee or the public is there any motion raise go ahead. That's Kevin! I was just going to do it verbally, okay, yeah! That's fine! I support the application I like to do a sorry. Can you hear me yeah? I can hear you okay, yeah. Yes, thank you motion of no objection that seconded Matt. You want a second fell. Second, all right, Matt, Bondi seconded. I know it's been a while since you've done an application, so it's a very little rusty, yeah right. So cody can you do the roll call, so there's a motion of no objection to the application, all right. Kyle aside in favor, Matt Bondi, did you read my lips?

Congratulations! Liliana and welcome to you Paul we're excited to have you. Thank you so much. Thank you! Everyone! Thank you very much! Kyle! I can't stay. I got to get my little girl to bed, but I'd love to connect with you Offline about your new business matter that you're on the agenda tonight, because it's something the alliance would definitely want to talk to you about. So absolutely. Thank you so much. Thank you. Everyone, committee members. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you all right. Can we go back to the agenda really quick. We have our final applicant for tonight, so we have the black water restaurant corporation who's, applying for an establishment at 975 second avenue. So again, just please introduce yourself your relationship to the application into the establishment and then just walk us through the concept of your establishment, and then you know some of the logistical specifics hours of operation and the concept of it. How you doing? How do you? How do you follow someone? As famous as Lillian, you know, hi, my name is Jason Jordan. I think I would I've probably meeting some of you through the neighborhood and but again pleased to virtually meet you as the only immigrant and small business owner on the agenda tonight. I really want to thank you for all the work these guys are doing to get us back up in business again we're trying to get on my myself, my wife, my kids, we're trying to get on our family we're trying to get on our feet again. After Covid-19 we do business for 19 years. We just closed the door, so it's very tough. We we live in. We live over the building in jemisons and what we propose to do there is to turn it into a restaurant bar. That's going to be family friendly. We want to do a kids menu. We really want because we're bringing up kids ourselves in the neighborhood. We really want to appeal to our places for everybody, that's accessible to what New York should have been before it was taken from us, and we really, we really believe in the space, and we think we can do a great job here. The hours of operations are going to be 10 to 4.. It's been a bar for 40 years. We've a lot of faith in the neighborhood. I've lived there as a kid. When I was 19., I moved back on my 30s with my family and we're staying put and we're going to wait it out and we're going to do the best we can. The menu is an american menu. We'll do one or two irish things we'll cater for what people want. You know there's change in taste now and that's what we're proposed to do. There'll be no live music. The doors will be closed. At 11. I'm living on the avenue, we know all the problems from the noise before we live through the irish exit. We lived through turtle Bay, bringing up kids, I'm not going to go through another Santa con again on 2Nd Avenue. So I'm well aware of the issues that are have to be dealt with. We offer I operate the business previously from 2013 2014 and because of health issues. I had to give it up, but now I'm really looking forward to the challenge and have a lot of faith and what will be done and what will New York will ultimately become. I think it will become a city for everybody again like it was when I moved here as a kid in the 90s if any questions fire off yeah, so I'll just begin with some basic ones, as people from the public get their questions and answers in and the committee as well again. Obviously, you mentioned obviously issues that are on that particular stretch of block. We have a lot of you know, bars and restaurants there in terms of noise and crowd, control and sanitation. Can you just walk us through some of the you know, plans that you have to minimize all of that? Yes, the building is already soundproofed. I live right upstairs from it. We have a regular garbage company that picks up every night and that's the way it'll be done, crowd control, it's not going to be a crazy kid's bar. I am 45 years of age. I can't run a place like that and in terms of my 20s I did have kids bars and they were good, but not now and in terms of the community relations. What are some of the you know, action steps that you've taken to ensure that you know your other neighbors feel comfortable, because obviously a lot of people have PTSD from some of the bad operators on you know on that stretcher block. So what are some of the you know, concepts you've taken to that regard? Well, I took all my time all the tenants in the building. You know we talked it's good. I talked to Angela next door, which is the buttercup shop and then Ashleen and her husband and the young baby live next door Murphy's. We know them all, so you know we're perfectly accessible. I told them what we're doing they're happy the five I get off. Everybody is once a turtle bay or irish exit does not go into the neighborhood. People are really excited about it. You know absolutely and in terms of your previous operation of it did you have any community issues any violations? No during your no, it was until you know my health issues. It was drawn perfect. The one problem I did have running it now, on which I'm happy was when I did have a previously. A lot of customers would come over from first Avenue and would come over to second avenue, which was fantastic, but on Friday and Saturday night. It would not come because of all these wild bars around the Pla that were around the neighborhood and we found out was a battle, but it's hopefully it's solved now and then, as I asked the previous applicant as well, we asked that you post a sign outside of the establishment, obviously asking people to be considerate of neighbors, but also with the contact name and direct phone number to whoever the general manager on or the manager on premises. Unfortunately, that'll be. That would be me it's the book stops here. Okay, so yeah. If you want you, if you want your number out there, but yeah so because you know, we want to make sure again that any community issues are dealt with between the establishment and the you know, and the neighbor before you know escalating into something that it does not need to escalate to. As I mentioned quite often, these issues are solved. If there's just you know, response to the complaints, acknowledgement and then obviously addressing that specific issue, absolutely Jeannie, I see your hand up hi. Yes, thank you just a quick question. I noticed on your questionnaire that you do not have any outdoor space, but given the uncertainties of the pandemic are you I know this is not part of the licensing or any other for tonight, but I'm just curious whether or not you would even consider some outdoor seating, I'm not too sure when will open so we'll approach that when we open Jimmy, where you know it's just one day at a time at the moment, hey. Thank you Susan hi, thank you for coming before us. Every year we have the scourge called Santacon. I just want to feel good that you're not going to host that. I have never done Santa Con in any of my establishments in 19 years. I do not know where this thing came from, but I do not think it's right that a busload of drunken santas go down an avenue and young children look at them. I just do not believe it belongs in college campuses and not in a city. Okay, I'm glad to hear that. Thank you thank you and then cody can we actually get from the public Glenn cosman? Can we get him to speak? A little bit I've given Glenn permission to speak, so he can unmute himself and ask his questions verbally. Awesome, hi, Glenn, you're on okay. Thank you. So a couple of questions number one is, I believe you said that you're going to be open hours of operation from 10 to four is that 10 A.M to 4, A.M or 10? Well, you know yeah, that's what we're hoping for when if things get back on its feet again in New York, you know: okay, not every night, we're not going to do 4 a.m. Every night, you know we'll every night would be different. Sunday night you would not be opening late, but when we have people there, we would like to have the option. Obviously- and hopefully, when restaurants get back, there will be. You know some restaurant workers after work, somebody who lives in the community. We actually have some issues with bars, open till 4 am in the morning. You know I just as a feeling I think 2 A.M is probably the latest that I would feel comfortable, but that's just something from the neighborhood. So that's just I do not think you speak for all the neighborhood glenn the people I've reached out to they. They understand. Sometimes you stay open till 2:30. Sometimes it can be 2 15. we're in uncertain times now we're trying to pay property tax, we're trying to pay rent. It's you know, I'd we're, making a gallant effort here to try and go again. We do not want to know another empty stair storefront on second avenue, with the social problems that are going on at the moment, and if you walk up and down the avenue you'll see where there's a lot of vacant storefronts and a lot of problems. Well, I could definitely feel for you for paying the taxes and everything no yeah. I understand that. Will it be a dj at no okay, great and the question? Would you use any outside promoters? No, never have never willed great. If we can't run a business ourselves, we won't do it perfect. Okay, that's basically my questions. Thank you thanks so much glenn, and can you also just state your connection to the community in your role here? Please sure I am the president of the board of directors of the Leslie House and one of the members of the East town East Midtown coalition. Thank you so much glenn for attending today. Thank you, cody. Can we also let robin stroll speak? Please? Yes, she can unmute herself, and can you just please yeah? We can hear you robin. Can you just please also, you know, establish your connection to the community and to this particular applicant, and why you're here today, yeah hi Kyle, it's Joni schachter, I'm here with Robin Stroll who lives in my building, I'm the president of the board of 251 East 51St street, I'm also our building is also part of the neighborhood coalition that Glenn belongs to and we are right on the other side of buttercup bakery, and I want to welcome you to the neighborhood. I know you, I know you're well, I know pascal well there. I know everybody in that building yeah. I wish it was a supermarket still. But what do you do? Okay, well we're the ones that had all the complaints with irish exit and turtle Bay Tavern and frankly, I do not want to go through that again, I get the phone calls from my shareholders and I know you'd like the option to stay open until four, but we'd like the option to get us to sleep long before four yeah. I do not. You know what I lived there in 1998 and I worked in the irish eggs when it was previously in irish park, which it was for 40 years. There was never an issue on that avenue with a late noise. Never until that irish exit came in, my wife was one of the. My wife was one of the people who called and called you and called the local precinct and talked to the precinct about it with noise. So no, we won't have any issues and my number's there I'm accessible. If you stay open till four, you are going to have issues because I do not want my shareholders calling me at four o'clock in the morning. Well, I I'm living over the building with three kids, and I know for a fact. You know we, it won't be around like any of these places. It's a small space, we're not going to use outside promoters and we're not going to win this open and Blair noise like they did, and I know for when Jameson's was there since 1987, there was never problems with noise and it was open to 4 am so. This is just a new thing on second avenue. This was not always the way it was well. I would like to request 2 o'clock and if your good neighbors then applied to go to four o'clock, you have no control of the people once they leave your place right, it's grandfathered in since 1987 and nobody has any control of anybody want to leave any restaurant any store any deli. So that's what we're going to do. Can I ask you a question? What other establishments do you own? We I used to have a jameson's and I had a park coffee in Astoria I had a Mer buskers on a 92 west Houston, my wife previously owned Gatsby's bar for 19 years. So I have a lot of experience. I've been at this game since I was 19 year old kid as a bus boy on Twitter Avenue. So the James that's there. Now you need yeah. Yes, oh okay, I mean I'm, I go to yeah, I had not. I had it in 2013 and we never had a problem in Jameson's noise and I do not know what happened over the few years. There I've lived there and I use them. I'm not happy with how it turned out the avenue and we definitely want to right or wrong, and I mean this is Rob and I'm fine. The way that Jamisons and Murphy's have been handled over the past couple of years. I go there all the time and it's tony I it's the same deal it's. I love those two bars so yeah. I think you know, I think they're a New, York, bird or pj Clark's is closed up. The pig and whistle is gone on toward avenue. There's not many of you know places like this anymore left. We want. We want to keep the irish pubs. I love the irish pubs. Well, you know they've always kept the neighborhood good yeah and that's one thing for sure. But murphys and jamisons are really favorites of mine and I'm very sad about it. You know so if we can keep it at the same level, it'll be the same level, yeah right, better, hopefully better, and I will say to the community concerns. Obviously you've been working with our committee. You know for a very long time now I took over his chair a couple of years back and one of the things that we have been very intentional about is, and I've seen you all at meetings in person, because we've held meetings in person is to hold the establishment accountable to what they promised to the community and to make sure that they're, good operators and when that was not respected and when all of you were not respected. We took swift and decisive action and one of the things that I've been very encouraged by particularly with this block, is that we're getting a lot of good operators in and a lot of the operators. There are, in some cases to no fault of their own. You know making up for the sins of Turtle, Bay and irish exit, and what I'd love to see in the neighborhood is to see you know. We already have the restaurant row, East alliance, who has been doing a lot of great work for the community too, and making sure that things are organized and noiseless, and you know social distancing and all of that, and so we want to you know, add to good operators that we already have and to welcome the new ones that are going to be great as well, and so I think part of that you know is why we're going through all this and why your conversation? No, I personally understand I live over germans. I have so I understand it's perfect and it's Joanie again. I will say we never in all the years I've been in this building since the late 70s never had any problem with Jamison's, no absolutely yeah, but I do have one request: can you please have your windows and doors closed by nine o'clock on the weekdays and 10 o'clock on the weekends yeah we'll adhere to that? That's fine! Okay! Thank you! Fine! No! That's fine, julie, yeah and thank you. We were happy to have another. You know, establishment in the area that we can go to yeah. I mean perfect all right, so seeing no more questions or comments from the committee or the public. Does anyone have a motion of no objection to the application, with the stipulation that the windows will be closed at 9:00 p.m, on the weekdays and 10 P.M on the weekends? This is so moved. Motion of no objection. All right motion of no objection from sema is that seconded by anyone how's the second issue. So can we go through the roll call cody, please, okay. Kyle said I'm in favor Matt Fondy in favor and divine favor Jeannie Genofrio in favor, page judge in favor, Kathleen Kelly in Favor, Kevin O'keefe in favor, see Michelle in Favor, Susan Steinberg in favor, great, that's 10 in favor, no against no abstentions. Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody for your time. Thank you for joining us and thank you to the members of the public for coming in and voicing your concerns as well. I always appreciative and value your thoughts and words. So as we close off the meeting, thank you and hope you enjoy your night. Thank you so much so. As we conclude the meeting, I want to go through just a couple of things to share back for the chairs report. I do not have anything major. The only thing is. I want to make everyone aware of an issue that we've had with bar kogi, which again is on this strip of block closer to 51st, and the issue we're having is with their outdoor dining setup. It has taken over the block. It has actually impeded the entrance to the residential building, that's next door to it. So I received a lot of complaints from people in the community. In fact, even some old community board members who sent me videos pictures- and so we reached out to the owner of barcogi, who one week ago, said that they were going to abide by the requests that I made to make sure that they were compliant with everything, particularly with the social distancing, which is obviously of most concern is the public health, and so they said that they were going to implement that so I'll be monitoring that to make sure that there are actual changes with that. So I'll do a you know a quick bike buy or walk by and also follow up with the people who informed me of the issue. So I just want to make sure that everyone is aware of that. We have reached out to them and actually asked for very actionable and specific things for them to do to alleviate the situation so moving on to or actually something that I just heard about today, we will be continuing our partnership with Community Board eight. I was speaking with their chair of the of the Community Board and we wanted to continue with the online workshops webinars that we had conducted earlier in the summer, but instead focusing on retaining businesses and drawing businesses back in so I'll continue to get onto those planning calls to figure out. You know what this could look like. Obviously getting you know more businesses from our district to discuss their experiences and their needs and issues, but if anyone on the committee would love to join me with that in my planning, please let me know it's great. You know to have a you know: partnership on that as well. So please connect with me offline. If you are interested in working on that with me. So moving on to new and old business, I do want to bring up some new business which was brought up earlier, which is about this indoor dining situation. So, as most of us know, the outdoor dining plan is set to expire at the end of October. Part of that is, of course, the you know, temporariness of it, but also the seasonality of it, and so one of the things that we've heard today that I also wanted to bring up is that we have not really heard any plans from the state level or the city level as to what's going to occur after that point, one of the reasons that you know many businesses, particularly bars and restaurants have been able to continue, is because they've had that option of outdoor dining but come October 31st. We have not heard any inkling of of what's going to happen after and of course, as lily Leanne mentioned earlier, we're not sure what's going to happen after that, and that would you know, obviously result in many closures of establishments that we've been familiar with and hold dear to our hearts. So I do want to discuss, and perhaps this could be a you know, resolution that we decide on now, or maybe a conversation that we put till next month, but remember it does need to go before full board, which puts us in a time issue what we want to think about for indoor dining. We can put a resolution together either with specific ideas that we have. You know whether it would be reduced occupancy to ensure that social distancing is continued, but, as was mentioned earlier, we have met the criteria for other areas, but the mayor has not put out anything about that or we could, just you know, put a resolution that there needs to be a plan put together for indoor dining before October 31st, because to me just even in terms of timelines, it seems very burdensome and unfair to the local businesses themselves because they have no way of planning for after October 31st and the closer and the you know the smaller that timeline becomes, the more burdensome it becomes and the more likely it is that they will close. So I do want us to be proactive on this and coming together with some ideas or even just coming together to you know, light a fire under the city to make sure that they are thinking about this proactively and are putting something together that is actionable and also, at the same time minding public health. I can go on about this, but I do want to open it up for any. You know initial comments about that. About what we should be doing and what you think we can do if we want to put something together now or if you want to have the conversation for a later point, does anyone have any thoughts and if you're an attendee as well, please feel free to contribute as well through the Q&A function? Let's see, let's start with Kathleen hey, I guess I just have a different perspective on it that our focus tonight is on businesses, and you know, I think we need to look at. You know, what's the truth, that the state version versus the city's version on what they're looking at the timeline month by month and also perspective, is you you still can't visit your relative. I still can't visit my mother in the nursing home on York, Avenue and 72Nd street, yet because they have not had 28 days with all covered negative between residents and staff. This is within our same city, so I just think working really closely with the Department of Health the CDC. I just do not know how they're putting their perspective together for what they see is happening. You know September and October when they're looking at a comeback for Covid-19 there's. Definitely you know, we know the numbers are so much lower but they're still there. So I just do not know. You know where they're getting their rationale and their and their timeline for putting a plan together like this aside from political groups fighting with each other. Where are we really getting information about this? No Dude Dan. Let's see your hand up quickly. I second everything that Kathleen said, because I think it's spot on and Kyle. I do think the sooner the better that we can back something like this, especially when we know that places just outside of the city are more or less. You know open on a limited basis for indoor dining- and I mean this disease is certainly. Your virus has certainly taught us that there are no borders, so I definitely support what you're what you're putting forth. Okay. Thank you. Are there any other questions or comments, because I put a suggestion out there, but I have not. You know dictated a specific plan, because there are two options that we could go by. We could request, we could put a resolution that asks you know either City Council or the mayor himself to put together a plan to to you know before October 31st for indoor dining. You know it's really been vacillating on that for the past couple weeks. When he's been asked that question, so we could do something like that or we could actually put together, and this you know, can incorporate what Kathleen was just talking about. If we want to put together our own sort of you know framework of what this could look like and put that forth. Obviously, once it goes forward, there's going to be a lot of changes just in terms of public health guidelines data. All of that so of course, it'll be changed to a little bit, but you know what I always say like: let's be proactive and demand what we want, and then you know and put that forward, so that electives have to be responsive to us instead of the other way around. So I do not know if anyone has any thoughts in response who's. Speaking sorry, hello did we just lose somebody. No sorry that was, I think, background noise. There's a community member okay. Are there any thoughts on that? Just put I put out some suggestions. This is schema. If I, if you do not mind if I share some thoughts, fine yeah one thing is, you know I know: molly was sharing about how all the Community board leads are actually like convening, I think, monthly, to talk about like issues acrosss shared issues- and I know that initially, it was kind of initiated through like talking about race and economic justice, issues that are shared acrosss. All the Manhattan community board districts, but you know one of the things that I know molly mentioned in the last exec was that you know they're going to be trying to convene subcommittees and again they might all be focused on race and economic justice stuff. But you know, I think that we could kind of tie if we could tie this in with like either what all the other Manhattan community board districts are thinking or doing, or even potentially just with CB8. Since I know we have a better relationship with them like, I think that would be more powerful and have greater impact if we worked with other board members, as opposed to just saying like this is what we think is good for you know whatever our 50 blocks, so yeah, that's kind of my initial reaction, just because I do not feel knowledgeable and competent enough to know all of the moving parts that are associated with making this decision fair point yeah. I think you know often those things we can start off. You know because those conversations are always better if we've thought through it as a committee first, and so that's one of the reasons I like getting things down into resolution form because it gives us a focus, concise, you know depiction of what we are thinking that we could. Then you know work on with the full board and then work with you know acrosss community boards as well, because I do agree like this- is something that is very big. It's something that needs to be advocated for, like just you know more than just our committee more than just our community board, but it does start here. So I do want to figure out like how exactly we want to think about this, and because this does, you know start with us here, Genie and then paige just a couple of additional thoughts about this we're going into the fall, and I think we all want these restaurants to have customers indoors. I mean we're going to get into rainy season hurricanes. All of that, my only concern is, we are going into the fall. There are students coming into the city now there are people coming in, and I think my guess is that the governor, if not the mayor but the governor, is looking at this and saying New York City is highly congested. We have all of these. People coming in they're coming in from states are actually in Quarantine states, so Missouri Georgia, whatever and they're. If they're coming in and they're going to start using the restaurants. Where will that put us if there's an infection rate increase back to square one? So maybe they are waiting until September comes around, maybe the second third week in September to see where everything falls. I'm definitely supporting all of this, but I am concerned of the spread of the virus. The numbers have been so low 0.78 today, 19 days in a row, one percent and so right now, New York City is congested. It's not like the rest of the state, so I just got to keep that in mind. No, that's a good! That's a great point! So that's one of the reasons I put for, like the other option off us saying that there needs to be a plan because I think even like right now. Even you know in this discussion we're speculating what they're thinking about in terms of a plan and to even just have transparency of where they are in a process or what they're, calculating or, what's even being included in a calculation would be valuable information for not only us but especially for the businesses to kind of think about. You know how they're planning ahead from their business, because I agree you know public health is number one, but at the same time, then you know the follow- up conversation you know after October 31st is like. Oh all, the restaurants are closed. You know what can we do now and at that point it's too late. So, yes, I do not know if any Genie. What do you think about that? If there's something more of like hey like we, you know, are asking for. You know, transparency and your thoughts, for you know what happens after October 31st or something to that nature. I agree. 100. Thank you. Are there any other thoughts? Any questions or comments on that from the committee or from page has a question or a comment page. I know I thought I saw your hand go down. Yep go ahead page. I agree with what you say, but I really feel that we have to know what the city is thinking before. We really make a resolution because we might be just wasting our time. Yes, they should open as soon as possible, except for me I would be one of the persons that could not go because of my limitations and my limitations is I'm quarantined, and the thing is that I really would like to know what the stipulations would that the city and the state would agree with to open a restaurant right. So that's the that's. The source of this whole issue right is that we do not know what I agree with everything you said, but I really do not make any kind of just outright thing and say a resolution, because we know something more, that's my point, but we could. We could have a framework right. I mean that's true of any resolution we ever put forth in any committee is that oh, the city might always know more, but yeah. That's what I'm saying. We do not need to do something right now, but there is a time crunch, because we are the last committee that meets before full boards. So that does mean, if we put it until next month that we would meet at the end of September and then that would any potential resolution would be done in the middle of October. So we can, you know, definitely take time on this. I'm not saying that we have to do something right now, but I do want us to start thinking about that, because it's getting a little bit too late, and you know with a lot of these issues- and you know part of why I think our committee, in particular is very successful, is because we're very proactive- and we put out there for elected officials to see like these are things that you should be taking into consideration. We're not writing the bills, we're not doing you know the actual work of it all, but it is expressing what our needs are as committee as community members as residents and as you know, concerned citizens, and that you know the things that we bring up should be taken into their equation and into their processes Dan and then Kathleen, yeah Kyle. I so yeah I spoke about. You know agreeing with everything. That's being said at the outset, so what about? If I, this, is what I propose. I think that we should have something that says that we recommend that we urge the city by September 31st to have an indoor dining plan based on specifically stated health metrics, and I think that that's kind of and we could work around the wording, but I think that's a good way to begin. Okay, Kathleen. I support the description that Dan just described and then also I just wanted to it's putting you on the spot, but you know, do you know any other community boards that have already like put a template together for a resolution, so I do not know that anyone is really thinking about it. But that's true of a lot of things that we've done. I think we're still the first, and only can you work cody, correct me if I'm wrong, that was, you know ahead of commercial rent control like over two years ago and now they're still talking about it. But a lot of the you know, suggestions that we put into that are being discussed now. So, for example, we heard Senator Hoyleman about talking about what small business is, which is something that we brought up. You know over two years ago, there's no city definition for that or focusing on mwbes, which are you know, minority and women- owned businesses so yeah. I do not know anyone else, but I think that's part of you know where we can take leadership as CB6, particularly because we are congested with a lot of restaurants and bars, and you know it's really crucial to our district, where we can then take the lead- and you know, start partnering up and say: hey you know like this is what we have from our committee from our what our full board pass like. Let's work on something together, because we can always do further resolutions ahead of time. You know that improve on what we put now. It's not you know the be all and end all you know just because we put something out. We can always improve on it. So I'd love for us to take, because I do not like us, you know being responsive to things because that's when you really lose any input because then you're being responsive to a bill, that's already out there and there's no incentive to be responsive, so we want to put like is, and what you were. Thinking is exactly right. Obviously, we do not have jurisdiction over you know senior homes, but those statistics, and that logic should be taken into consideration too, because the other fear is that it goes on the other end where it's like. Okay, like let's completely open indoor dining and no one has taken into consideration public health risks. You know because the concern is so economic, so we want to make sure that people are taking into contact. You know we're creating some sort of parameter or guideline for the city to follow as they're thinking about this and for us to have. You know same what we did with open streets. We can serve as the model for you know, other locations, so I do not like waiting around for other people to you know then say what might or might not be happening, but really for us to define what we want as a community. You know, after thinking about it thoughtfully susan. I just wanted to make a small correction to the proposed resolution. Let's not be asking anybody to do anything by September 31st, since September only has 30 days see that's how we'll see if they're paying attention you are so smart. Thank you. But yes, I do agree. I like the suggestion that Dan made I asking first for them to come up with a plan by a certain time, because businesses really need it. They need to know what the plan is. Otherwise they can't think ahead. Kevin. I do not know, if your hand is still up come on claim or together. I do not think it's rushing to say well, you're, saying not to say bye, September 30th, but I think you need to do that because we need to know you know how they're measuring well, I think Susan was making. I think Susan was making a joke because Dan said September 31st, so hopefully there's not 30. 31 days but yeah. I agree, I think, giving a defined time to say: hey put it together, we you know are requesting this, because this is important. We can do that and then, if we do not hear anything by them, then we can kind of put something more substantial and obviously we'll have more information by then, but also, I would just suggest you know all of us doing a little bit of homework on that too, because it is very important. So is very emotion of no objection to a Dan's proposal, putting together a resolution asking the city to come up with a plan by September 30th Dan. You can do it for your own promotion if you want yeah by September 30th with specifically outlined health metrics, second high. Second, all right seconded by Susan cody. Can we do the roll call sure kyle aside, I'm in favor Matt Bondi? That's no longer here, Dan Divine in favor, any dinoframe in favor, page judge, Favor, Kathleen, Kelly, Kevin O'keefe in favor, see Michelle in Favor, Susan Steinberg. All right, thank you, are there? Is there any other new or old business that anyone from the committee would like to bring up or from the public things that we should be thinking about as a committee, all right, I'm seeing none, okay, yep, just a question: what happened with the that open street idea on 2Nd Avenue and I think 51st street, what happened yeah? So what do you mean? Do they go ahead with that? Did they close the block and did they set up the restaurants in the street as proposed in their blueprints, so originally yeah? So the original proposal was because again we had done this so early and proactively that we had, you know, urged the city if they wanted to. You know roll this out slowly to use that block as a model, as you know, sort of like a pilot to see how the rest of the city would work, but the city just did it for everybody. We thought it was kind of. You know that it would be more. The city would be more open to saying: hey like let's try a block first and then see how it rolls out, but they just rolled it out so 50th and 51st is still doing that, but there have been no mentions of street closures and now they're still doing their their survey. I do not know if you remember the survey about city streets that are usable and not usable, and all of that based on that it does not seem likely that that's going to happen in that particular block, because it is a bus route. It is a bike lane route there's a lot of traffic. Obviously that goes into Queen's Midtown tunnel, but other than that. The purpose of the of that particular resolution was to get outdoor dining, which then happened so okay. So I'm assuming, therefore, that the restaurant owner I forgot his name that came in, is yeah, satisfied with that and I'm hoping he's doing good yeah. So I yeah I followed up with him, particularly because you know we're also talking about the issues with you know, Bart Kogi, being in violation of some things and so he's been taking in an active lead. As you know, the head of the restaurant row, East alliance and working with all of them to get things done so he seems to be doing fine. He has not mentioned anything new to me, but I did check in with him about so yep. Okay, is there any other new or old business from anyone else on the committee or from the public? Seeing none I'm going to make a motion to adjourn the meeting at 9:24 pm. If you are, if there are no objections, we will then adjourn the meeting all right, seeing no objections. Thank you. Everyone for joining us tonight and also thank you in general, for continuing to meet during the summer we're the only committee that has been doing that. But it's because there's a lot of responsibility on our plates, and so I just want to thank everyone for their engagement and commitment to all of this work. As you saw tonight, I made a lot of great speakers and it is really appreciated by the business owners. The the unions, the you know, the groups out there, so I just want to thank each and every one of you for your commitment, hi. Thank you so much thanks, Kyle, thank you. Everybody stay well and have a good evening. Bye.
