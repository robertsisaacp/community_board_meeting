Okay, The agenda for tonight's meeting was to distribute it ahead of time by the board office and appears on the screen before you committee, members.
By, raising your hand, through zoom chat, should only be used to alert us to any technical difficulties you are having or to state in writing information like an email address that was already stated aloud on the record during the meeting when a committee member is given the floor to speak, I will identify you and you can unmute yourself so that you can speak.
Vice Chair, Rich Mintz, will be looking through the questions as they come in and will read the questions aloud and direct them to either DHS or core, and with that being said, our we'll get to our first agenda item, which is the presentation by core services, group and department of Homeless services on a new permanent homeless, shelter for adult families at 118, east 40th, street.
Data from 2019 suggests that New York City really has 78,000 house residents, that is shelter and people living on the street, and that is not to mention many families that double up in apartments or triple up in apartments, especially nowadays.
So then, one of the other just reading the comments, The reading the questions I want to make everyone aware that you know this particular shelter is right at the border of CB6.
We need to get a better set of communications between the community boards between DHS, so that we're just not kind of working in our own little pocket, not knowing what's happening in CB5.
One of the things that I would like to talk about is better communication and sharing of information about districts close to us and with that I will handed the floor over to DHS.
We're honored to be joined, but I have Keisha Phipps here from core, along with Gordon Jackson, who will be handling security for the site, which I know everyone has lots of questions about, so I really would love if it works for everyone.
We are at the Department of Social services responsible for ensuring that anyone that seeks housing in New, York City that seeks temporary shelter is able to find it, and we do that, of course, by helping individuals who are both chronically the chronically street homeless.
The shelter that we're talking about at 118, east 40th street is going to be, of course, for adult families, as many of you may be familiar with are folks that are any kind of couple or partnership that are above 18.
It's, not just about having a good shelter that provides services for clients in the building, But we're very aware that it's really important.
What happens outside the building is equally important and we really strive through, as you mentioned, having community advisory board to ensure that we will be able to make sure that we are held accountable and hold core accountable to do the kind of work that we expect with inside the building and also outside and without further ado Leilani.
We're, strongly committed to having open and ongoing dialogue with the communities in which we serve, and you know, forums like this are especially important to us as we start programs, and we want to make sure that we can set up meaningful and sustained relationships with the community.
We are here today to talk about adult family shelter to be located at the Renwick hotel, 118, east 40th street core works daily with single adults, families with children and young people to harness their own strengths, and we basically identify and break barriers to independence and build bridges to self-sufficiency and change the lives of the clients that we serve.
We serve about 3,000 clients daily in close to 40 sites, both in Washington DC and New York, and we have programs survey serving the re-entry population, homeless, shelters for single adult males families with children, adult families, programs for runway, homeless, Youth, Lgbtq, Youth, homeless, young adults and person living with HIV Aids.
Our families face more barriers and roadblocks, but they really work hand in hand with our staff who facilitate you, know their achievement of goals, while they're in their program, which get them to the ultimate goal of transitioning to permanency.
Our work is grounded in the values of treating our clients with dignity and respect, first and foremost, understanding the importance of compassion, because we know that again they face myriad of challenges that we have to support them on a day-to-day basis and accountability and excellence.
So, most important and foremost, We have to understand what those needs are, So, the very first thing that happens when a client comes into our program.
You know be time-bound for, However long we expect that person to be in the shelter achievable and we work with that client to achieve those goals.
They're assigned a case manager who will you know, provide services and in-house then also make referrals to community-based organizations, and one of the things that we will do is identify local community-based organizations that can enhance the services that are available for our clients.
You know to make that resource available for the next family that may need it, Of course, We believe that employment and permanent housing are the twin keys to long-term success.
Looking at counseling, You know anything from relapse, prevention, identifying, managing triggers and having those conversations in a clinical way, and, of course, making referrals to community-based partners for any additional support that client may need in the community and one of the things so between the case.
You know it starts with the program director who really plays a critical role in making sure that there is adequate supervision at the site to ensure that the safety and security of the residents, the staff, the visitors in the community as a whole.
We, want to make sure that we maintain good relationships with our neighbors and that's important, not just for us as an organization, but that's something that, as it relates to independent living, we have to empower clients to be able to do.
You know the voices of the of our neighbors, whether it's clergy, community-based leaders, residents and you know, create a space where you can talk freely and transparently, and you know, at the end of the day, hold us accountable for what it is that we're saying we're going to do.
They go through many of the trainings that our program staff go through because we know that guards are often the first line of observing behaviors that can sometimes impede on quality of life, so part of the core and pro core models that relate to security and how we manage and really look to get supportive relationships in a community really ties into quality of life right, because we want to make sure that, when this site opens at our clients can enjoy their quality of life, but at the same time, balance that, with the quality of life that already exist in the neighborhood.
So you will see pro core bikes that will be, you, know, really just community engaging so to speak and providing a security presence, we're not there to engage every single, client.
There will be a security manager who will be at that site, as well as the operations coordinator, as well as the program director, and we all work together in the team.
I'm, also going to be overseeing the program at East, 14th, Street, 180, Eastman, 40th Street, and what we want to do as core is win the same type of program that we are running at these residents over to east 40th street we've been very successful here with the elected officials with the community members, we're on the community board 14.
We, while challenging them to improve their lives by gaining and securing permanent housing and becoming contributing members of the community.
Okay, I've got some questions where there's only going to be security on site.
Our supervisor from core services has more experience in and engaging the clients we're going to have such case managers on site from one to nine every day on saturdays or do from nine to five thirty.
I have learned through all my years of working with homeless families that you know it's what you do for them.
That is something that core ndhs in partnership with the electeds and the community board will help to create and form so that will only become live once the site has once the site opens up and Sonia that's correct.
You, know upwards of 170 families which would meet the need for DHS, and so we did submit a proposal for this site as in response to the open-ended RFP.
We do not wanna be in hotels, It's very clear that we would want to be in shelters like the runway, but we can actually have the kind of all services that we needed.
I know: Cody Osterman, the assistant district manager wanted to speak a little bit about my question: Cody hi.
So, I'm happy to take that question and in part you know, The, Murray Hill community is very, is one that's very fond and near to my heart in part, because my father and my stepmother actually live on 36th street on the east side and our.
Let me just let's start from the beginning by saying that this site, because we're working with the kind of provider that we're talking about and because we are so thoughtful and concerned and have to share the concerns- is not going to have the kind of impact that some folks may be concerned about.
So I just want to start with there, because there's a lot of fear-based concerns regarding our sites and there's a lot of fear regarding what does it mean to have shelters.
What, we have is an open-ended RFP process, because New York City has a legal mandate to provide shelter for all those who need it.
That are, you know, and people are going to be at the Renwick, and sometimes the community is confused.
I think the city has done and how they communicate with us on the committee on the board and also all the people who live in not just our district but other districts.
The second time that one of these shelters has been put up with no communication, and the city can say that they have this meeting, but the fact that matters.
If you look even at these questions, then it again happens and it's an attitude that the city is going to go and do these things and take these actions and basically do what they want and have these meetings after the fact.
I appreciate them, making that ultra clear, because that was never made clear about the site that I live next to, but I think the main question that I have on behalf of a lot of people in this meeting.
How is the communication from the city going to change, because this just doesn't seem fair to everyone, who's living and by the way, extremely sympathetic to these people who are, in these situations extremely sympathetic to homeless people extremely sympathetic to people in need.
As the chair of the housing and Homeless Committee I thought that most people, when they say I, want to be notified before they open.
Certainly we're happy to have community conversations regarding this site moving forward, as it is a permanent shelter.
I live across the street from a temporary hotel, shelter operated not by core by another provider.
One of the things we've learned is that the security staff know all the residents personally and know exactly who is likely to have what kinds of issues challenges or problems.
You know folks can come into the into our sites, regardless of their criminal background or criminal record, and if you are the only thing, that's matters is if you, in this case, you and your loved one are in need of housing and we are there to help provide it.
I think it's really challenging to talk about crime statistics and certainly in regard to homeless people or shelters, especially at this moment in time.
One question that someone asked related to those which I think also applies to this is going to be an adult family.
If you want to reach out with any types of concerns that you may have, Additionally, I will be out handing out business cards to local businesses to let them know that we are available to keep an open line of communication, no matter what happens additionally, as part of the staff and patent at this particular site.
Someone asked what the plans are to develop more permanent, supporting supportive housing in communities in district 6, so that people can be given more stable places to live in lieu of shelters and a related question.
Is that as the part of social services, we don't actually operate that kind of supportive, housing, However, I will say this: We are actively looking whenever we can to figure out if there are opportunities to convert shelter that we have in existence to also include a permanent, affordable housing as a part of it.
You know looped in as we have those conversations as we look about the city because obviously affordable housing is so important.
Okay, all right, well, I mean this is a question that we've talked about before in committee, and so we probably will need to get some more information about the mechanisms for developing permanent supportive housing.
Counseling needs, whether those services will be provided on site and how this compares to how things are done in other shelters, core.
But I think it's important that we, the provider, is engaged with that client to ensure that you know whatever needs to happen, that they do.
I'm wondering if anyone from core can give us information about statistics that reflecting their performance and helping to transition people successfully into permanent supportive housing or into independent living sure, So, I, think.
This one I, think, is a question for core the residents who move the families who move into this facility.
A question from someone who asks given that this is a permanent shelter and the residents are likely to put down roots in our community, at least for a time.
I have one general question about people experiencing homelessness, who are providing who are responsible for quality of life disruptions, and this is not specifically about this shelter.
You know, the answer to this- is not to ask people to just go somewhere else, so you don't have to look at it, but it's about, but yet these shelters are also not.
Okay, going to our second and last agenda item, which is a discussion on City Council, Intro 1977, which is you know, actually talks.
