Event is recording, listen event, listen to me. Okay, you want to make us hungry Julia. That's what I was that's. Why I'm eating something I should not be eating. I did not make my dinner eating garbage if I cooked I would have had my vegetables and I am eating corn muffin. Oh I love, corn, they're, not good for you exactly. Let's see the huge ones, I, love them, but they're not good for us they're, not good for you over 50 and 60. well, Tommy's age. You can eat a corn muffin and work it out. Tommy can have all the corn muffins he wants. Yes, don't worry, they'll catch up to you soon. You ain't got long before you, 50. I know how old you are I see Maria coming on. Oh, we can't hear you unmute. This is what my computer's been doing for the last 15 minutes. Dale, here, hey Dale. How are you? Oh there you go now, how's it going so far. Okay, listen we're alive, we're healthy! That's what matters! Thank you! Yes, we are yep. You know I'm waiting for anybody else, Maria how many people are on the call. I can't gage one two, three four, including you make five plus the folks from Hester Street we're good. Okay, I! Don't like my phone, because I can't see everyone. My phone doesn't allow me to see everyone on the call, all right six lines: yeah we should and so who's the who's managing this is it Marie. Are you managing it yeah trying to yes, okay, good! So can we do a roll call, Maria Vieira here I'll take what's done, Phil Capenegro, Mommy, Torres, All, right Giovanni's, here yeah, I'm here I think we have budget committee hearing, I'm so happy, I'm so proud. Oh yeah, you're doing better than I did who's that Julia. My meeting was crazy. I, don't know what meeting that was. I didn't see nobody. We couldn't hear nobody. Oh that's terrible too bad! I'm sorry progress. We got through it so we're meeting today to discuss when we're going to and thank you Hester Street who's on from Hester Street. This is Julia and Caesar's on as well. It's hard to tell if you're unmuted, I'm with you it's difficult to do this on the phone sucks yeah. That's rough I like zoom lets me see a lot of things at once: yeah, I'm with you. So we wanted to meet just to coordinate the presentation, the final presentation to the community to the board to the members and anyone else that wants to join, which is probably the last item right. The grand finale and trust me no one, but the budget committee wants to actually get through this last hurdle in one piece: yeah. Oh this sucks, can you hear me we can hear you but you're going in and out so we're missing words of what you're saying. Oh geez, Louise I said that no one, but us no one more than us- wants to get through this final hurdle. This lapse this. You know this is it we want to get it over with it's June. We have a deadline. We want to meet the deadline. We want to make sure that we follow the work scope that everything that was in the work scope has been completed for our agreement and that we're good to go and that the community gets to join in the last activity, which is what we had discussed originally, whether now it's virtually because of what's happening in social resistance and everything else, but to just get it through and I. Don't think that anyone can actually track on the fact that this is how we have to do it, because there is no other way exactly so. With that said, the discussion is more to discuss. The discussion is more to kind of come to an agreement as to when we're going to present this last. You know iteration of the work scope, the final, the grand finale as I said before you know the presentation and to whom we are presenting it that's important, because we can say we're presenting and we're presenting it to CB1. The thought was that we could, you know, have folks from the community join and learn from what we've discovered through this process and I think there were two things that we had mentioned: one presentation or discussion with the land use committee and or the executive or just the community board. There was a presentation to the board and there was a presentation to the infinity itself and I think now. We've had kind of scale and have that one presentation in one because of the climate that we're currently in is that is that the case am I right or wrong. We were. Can you hear me just want to make sure I'm not immunized yeah I. Think I mean one thing that we are thinking about, and it's actually something we're doing on a lot of projects. Is it's like videotaping or just recording these meetings too, and so we can do one. We can do one training that is recorded separate from the training that we're facilitating with you all, or we can record the training with actual participants on the line. I think we could do it both ways so that it's something that you guys can post up on your website and can be accessible for folks like the broader community who can't attend this upcoming training, just with everything going on. So it's something that we keep and that we can actually present at any time. It doesn't happen and it's something honestly, you could just upload the link and people could view in their own time as well, if they're as they see fit or whatever, and it's something that you can use on future trainings with different committees or the like I think. That's a great idea. What does the rest of the committee say? I think that's great. So we are thinking in terms of timeline for the training, I believe I. Think I open up the discussion. I echo your sentiments if it's with the land, Use Committee or the board, who that audience should be we're targeting the last week in June for that and have a couple dates: we're thinking the 29th just because it's been like a standing meeting time for the internal group, but we're open to others that we can throw out there as well. So could I just make a recommendation because things have to be done by a certain date, so you guys get paid for it. Can we schedule it a week before the last week, just in case like there are any technical issues and it can't happen. Yeah I mean it's the recommendation. It's just yeah, you guys get paid. You know once we do this before the 30th and the 29th is really close. Yeah close how about the the 25th it's the week prior to Thursday, it's kind of the same time. We are thinking and the holiday. Is it? Let me pull up the calendar I, don't believe so. Not any religious holiday fall on there and no we're good I. Have my church calendar, okay and then so that can be the training with the community. We can either film and record that one or Caesar and I can host kind of like a separate training for ourselves where we're just recording kind of the material Julia Sorry to cut in again- and I'm sorry, you know if I'm cutting in on anyone, if you were no contract, the way that it was that you were supposed to do like one meeting where you're showing I guess us and then there's the larger meeting and again technical reasons for everyone to get paid right, I mean so we are thinking instead of I mean in lieu yeah in lieu of the larger in person. That would right, I think what he's saying is that we stated we were going to do the committee and I think the executive board first before we went to the whole board. Is that what you're saying Giovanni? Yes yeah, because that's I think that was in the contract? That's what we discussed yeah, that's what we had discussed so shouldn't! We keep it that way. Instead of trying to chop up and go here there and everywhere, anybody heard me see: that's why I talk so loud see because people don't hear you just for clarity. Can we repeat that one more time is I told you didn't hear me well, I was like I think I was processing, it I think we were proposing that one of the meetings is like a training that you can post online, which would be for the larger community. So that would be meeting one and then meeting two. These aren't in consecutive order. They could be in whatever order meeting, but it was the executive board first, along with this committee and then the open to the public. Okay, perfect, that sounds great I feel like that's what we decided on so the meeting that we're proposing with the executive committee and this team is the one that we're talking about for the 25th. Okay. To be honest, the general meeting would be the week after well I, not I, guess one question is we are proposing we're just gonna film it and then you guys post it. So it's something that anybody can follow along with in their own time, just given the craziness of folk schedules right now, their focus and energy. It would be a training that is for the larger community. But it's not a scheduled meeting. It's a meeting that anybody can kind of use the resources at any point. So in other words, we just have the one training with the executive board in this committee and then that would be filmed or recorded, and then we present it and show it to everyone else. Yeah I mean we're or it could be two separate recordings. What yeah, whatever it is, I make a recommendation. Can we use maybe one of the Monday meetings that we have planned to be executive board and then the 25th for the full community board? Again it's that contract. The way that contact was easy. That's what I was going to say Giovanni. Thank you, sorry about that and I hate being a stickler, but I'm the one in my school that has to deny purchase orders and you know, ask for the signage needs. Yeah I was gonna. I was that is a very valid reason and the other re. The other thing is also that we, what we discussed is that the community event- and now it's going to be virtual or not, it was going to be an interactive kind of engagement so that the members of the community board have the ability to ask questions and or members of the general community that was agreed and I. Don't think we can go back on that, even though it's virtual, it can be the way we're meeting right now. You know okay, so let's do in case. Let's do the public meeting on the 25th yeah and then the meeting with the executive board and this team on the 29th. If that's okay, so now we're going backwards again, it would be backwards because that then the it's backwards kind of we need to meet like the week of the 15th I. Think what I'm trying to do in the schedule is build in enough review time for the team to review material, but before we have the training, but that might actually not be necessary, and so, if we do the training on the 22nd, but we don't preview guys I guess. Why would we if we're giving you the training, I'll confer with Caesar but I? Think that would work season's right here right, I, just don't want to put him on the spot, 22nd and the 25th all right. Well, you know concerns that. Bonnie has expressed their value concerns. If we do this 29th meeting, which I don't I, really do think we have to do something earlier than the 29th and something goes wrong. There's a kink or something happens. You know. A natural event which you can never foresee contract is that the deliverables have not been met and that would present a problem with payment the committee first, so we could get a sense of how it was going and then to maybe we would have some comments of things we wanted changed and then it would go board and then the full board has the opportunity to ask questions and that's why I'm saying we need to go up to the 15th. Yes, the 15th, not the 22nd, and then the 25th. We need to push back we're trying to finalize a bunch of materials to get you guys for review on the 12th, which is separate from this presentation in training, so I would propose I just like knowing the way we work. I think we'll be able to pick up edits between the 22nd and the 25th. No problem, yeah I think the 22nd and the 25th is fair. You know, let's go with that I. You know, because that gives you a little bit. Someone is texting that it's good I don't know who it is, whoever it is. That's sexy Tommy! No, it's me I, really think that's cutting it kind of close, because you know what you still have to present the fact that you gave this session and that paperwork has to go in and it might just reach those people by the 30th. You wonder we're happy at 3R Street to take that risk. What about your payment? We're we'll take the risk with this. You must got plans. We can. You know we'll work to document the 22nd right after the 22nd and you know well, it will be record recorded and I think we'll be okay, because I'm really shocked that the fact that they didn't give us an extension due to this pandemic I am very shocked that they didn't, as am I, but the fiscal year is the fiscal year all right comprehend, but I am small as well. I'm not going to push that! You will take the risk if you don't get paid on the 30th, because the 25th is when you're going to present it. Then you got to get the paperwork out to whoever's, going to pay you that this took place on there now you're. Looking at the 26th as a Friday, then Saturday then Sunday they might not get it until Tuesday, we'll prep that invoice right now with the date of the 25th ready to hit send after that final meeting, yeah. Okay! Well, that's the risk. Okay, it's a risk that you guys are willing to take. Then you know it is what it is. Okay, so the 22nd the 25th same time so 6:30. does that work. I! Think Marie has to be the one to vet that okay 6:30 we reached 22nd. Can you just thirty or six I'm looking at the calendar? When is the last official day of school, Giovanni 26 I, don't yeah I go all through the Selma, so I don't have I, don't know what the last day is. The 26th yeah 26. grandson's graduation in the house on the 25th. Ah, he going to high school, ah yeah, so we're doing here. I do you should be proud, I'm so proud and scared. At the same time, my grandsons want to spend time. I'm scared. Where is he going? I, don't know, send him to Giovanni School and then make sure Giovanni watches him. He lives on the lower east side he's not coming over. Here you were looking and we're proposing for the 22nd and the 25th Marie. Are you sharing that office huh? Are you sharing your space with somebody because I see you wearing the mask? Oh, no, I'm the only band in here. So let me ask you questions. Take it off you ain't doing it. I do have a note. The question is I. Believe next week is the executive committee meeting so any dates we'll have to. We have to confirm: that's why we're punching it to you right so I can't say anything until after Tuesday's meeting Tuesday next executive committee meeting. When is the executive committee Tuesday, the 9th it was in place of the board meeting? We took the date of the regular board meeting that was scheduled so that we're you know that date was carved out and so Marie. This is the million-dollar question: what is the board meeting I? Don't know that's what you're going to have to discuss it because we're going to talk about it at the executive, Committee, Meeting, Maria, okay, threw everybody in a tailwind, yeah I hope it's in the evening that meeting no I believe it is huh I. Believe it's 6:30, yeah I, I'm working too I can't come I have to come after work. It's 6:30 on the 9th I, don't have a job it's a half hour later than we would have met at a regular board meeting right so 6:30. Yes, you two have to be there. Why we're meeting virtually? Why are we meeting at 6:30? I'm just pushing this? We should meet at six, get it over with you just said you had to go to work. We don't have to travel. We don't have to travel to the meeting. There's the difference we set it up. I put it into Webex already for 6:30. and told to talk to dialysis. But that's what I have said. Okay, so sounds like a plan. Hence the street and Budget Committee, the 22nd and the 25th, or the proposed dates. Yeah yep. Everybody agree. No. As long as they're, they will take the chance about getting the payment on the 30th. I'm in agreeing ain't letting that go I have a question for them. Okay, I'm here I thought I, don't know because I may be losing my mind and you know I don't get paid to remember stuff. So it's okay I thought that we had agreed that the land, Use Committee and the executive committee would get to see that first, yes and us yeah. Of course they could be invited to the meeting. They can be invited. I, don't remember that, but they certainly could be invited we did and because of the way that we put in for the training for, oh god, I can't even think now that we're being discussed at the training right a lot of matters that makes sense. That's that makes sense if we can agree that that's what we agree on then I think that this kind of, if Hester Street, has anything else that they want to present to us at this time. I think that's. It I think that was the the purpose of this meeting. Okay sounds good, so we're going to meet on the 22nd, hopefully executive committee will meet on the 22nd executive committee is meeting on the 9th. Hopefully, we'll have the training on the 22nd and the 25th I put a question mark. Ah you're jinxing it we gotta bring it to the executive committee on the ninth Julia from Hester Street I just want to say this. The purpose of meeting with the committees prior to the full presentation is so that you can get the feedback if there's any feedback that makes that talks to making amendments or edits or whatever I'm concerned about the, but it's all good so good. Do nothing I, I'm glad that we're doing the exact I mean I, like the order. I'm like very looking very much looking forward to the feedback for the first kind of like trial round it'll be a good tester. I mean I'm trying to see where you're at all right so, and we like motion to approve that this is what we will present to the executive committee, make a motion I. Second, it anyone else. Second yeah, you got it okay motion passes. Thank you very much, Hester Street. Thank you very much, really my excellent, very excellent budget committee, who has done a yeoman's job going through this process of trying to deliver something that speaks back to what the community board has requested. Okay. Well, we satisfy them. Yes, well that not just the board but the community itself. So if we can agree to agree, does anybody motion to check out? Thank you have a good evening. Bye stay safe, everybody.
