We believe that this proposed parking facility is now needed and will add to the positive, ongoing changes to the neighboring communities of Williamsburg and green.
We, try to regulate the parking facility on the BQE, as Carlos mentioned earlier, through mirror parking for this area, and that will help us to promote turnover and reduce abandon of vehicles, reduce vagrancy, reduce illegal dumping, Schedule, cleaning of the fields provide more parking for area they optimize parking design, as well as provide spaces for persons with disabilities.
We have three phases: next, please so we're looking at phase one at this point in time, folks phase one we are focusing as Mike mentioned right now we are working in phase one.
If I know that some people went to the side this morning or yesterday, and they looked at the location, That's technically phase, one as Michael mentioned, That's what we are focusing right: now, The project benefits, so.
Parking will be available, but the mere regulation prevent long-term storage of vehicles, so the competing as we're all seeing now, with the advent of more restaurants on the curb the demand for the curb is continuing to grow, and you know this is another thing that we feel providing additional parking amenity, but a complete parking.
What are the hours of operation that makes sense for the community board in the neighborhood and then the overnight parking would be for free, So folks that come in after a set of time, they can leave the vehicle overnight, get up the next day and go to work.
Lane, so, Basically I mean regulating making this parking regulate the area that is going to prepare the way for a lot of amenities on the future in the near future.
Parking is working with other DOT divisions to ensure that those future bike lanes and other amenities can be accommodated.
Duties are also working on the design of bike lane and plans to return in the spring, with the plans which reflect previous workshops and community conversation.
Actually we showing what we did in Gowanus parking field, which is technically that is very similar to maker under this expressway before Gowanus, I'm, going to give you like a quick background of Gowanus is located under the third avenue on the BQE.
I mean that they came back, the community board, they came back, they said guys come continue and we need to regulate the whole area there.
We, will have almost from six five two, That's almost 13 bays is going to be regulated by the end of this year and the bay is from one Cross street, as Jamie said, to another, not a parking stall, but from one Cross street to the other.
You know we have meetings with D.O.T and with some groups going as far back as I think 2015, and maybe even before that we had a formal presentation in September of 2017 about general improvements to Meeker Avenue and.
Don't really remember, seeing an emphasis on any kind of you know, parking proposal or anything like that.
There was a lot of animated concern that the city was going to favor parking and car culture over things that we've been asking for sorry, My dog been asking for you know a long time and even in the schematics from the September presentation.
There's, you know kind of table set up makeshift parking, space, not part, not park space, but like recreation area type things, and when we were talking about the K Bridge completion, and this came up both on its own but also as we discussed the egress and entrance to the new Cambridge Bike lanes and the problems with the connector up.
And I know that you did that as like a visioning thing for people to get people to talk in the breakouts, And I understand that, but, You, know, repainted and made safer and Et cetera, and then that conversation came out of that.
You know where, in the community's mind, You know we understand that the the bureaucracy grinds slowly, but I think that the general feeling was that we were going to see.
I know, there's a lot of other residents that do rely on the parking for alternate side days to get in there.
It's kind of like a thing that we've had since, and you know if anybody on the committee got a chance to read: Jerry's email today.
You know when Robert Moses like toured the BQE through through the neighborhood, a lot of the people that lived through that.
First, okay, the advent of the immediate parking is, what's also going to precipitate return, a constant cleaning and maintain the site, but also it creates the canvas, as I said earlier, for the bike, lane.
Apologies for that, okay and maybe earlier workshops or things, but we are willing to work with you folks on how this would best serve you all right.
Do we need metered parking which is going to really hinder the community.
Okay, If the second area you want to do a park or something different, then that's what you guys would do, but we were looking at the first area to see how it works.
You know a mechanism and also without the parking and the regulation, people.
Also in regards to the Asp, as Mike mentioned, it's gonna come and with our proposal we will have our meter regulation, which is that's actually going to benefit the people who wants to park there for a long, time.
You know: that's what we're hoping to do, because does anybody want to park right across the street.
We want to clean that, but we also want it as a public space for pedestrians for cyclists and a balance to have also, You know: parking.
You, know bike lanes in open space you're going to take the infrastructure.
And I and they get it for a lot of other folks and better that they've been riding through a bike lane through this neighborhood, then on the side street of people desperately getting on the BQE.
And, then all of a sudden you have to like rip this up to put in you know like bike lanes or other kind of like things that the community's been asking.
When it's going to happen, you know I can't say when it will or not, especially when we receive an email, basically saying that you don't need community board approval and you're going to do it.
We're trying to work with you all right, William, Willis, Sorry, Wills, I, Just I, want to kind of echo.
This work was done led by the community in conjunction with D.O.T party and better utilization of the space and, frankly, The fact that I don't understand the relationship as to why this is Dot's responsibility and not sanitation's responsibility to clean up the trash.
If you really say that you're here to work with us, as Jerry said, you need to come back with a full plan that addresses pedestrian, safety, bicycle access, use of public space, etc.
We felt that, and we know for a fact that the additional parking would take the demand for the remainder of the network, the local streets and so forth.
Yes, people want free[ _ _], but they still they're going to get all controlled they're going to have to be moving around also, If other folks come into your neighborhood they're parked on your streets.
I, wasn't part of community board, but it was felt very strongly by cyclists on the people that drive cars, the people on the businesses, the business improvement, district and Karen's industrial providers that nobody was listening to and DOT just went ahead and did what they wanted.
But again, If this is the beginning of this, you know this wonderful, area, Let's see the full package come back to us when you have a full package to share with us, not just a piecemeal address to a situation that sanitation was addressing a lot of those sanitation issues until their hands were tied by a homeless, services.
I mean again, Let's see the full package where's everything that was discussed in those charrettes that you referenced and all of these good things that were going to happen and the bike lanes been so long and coming.
You know everything moves everything winds up taking longer than we expect, but, like I said, My understanding is that bikes was going to come back to the community board representation.
I, don't know that my understanding is we're going to take into consideration any position that the community board puts forth to us at this point.
You know it's like you're charging people to park in the most undesirable spot.
We said: well, You know if we did go in there and we provided a needed parking facility for at least three blocks to see how it works.
It's really important a huge disappointment, I think from the community as a whole that this is what D.O.T is in the middle of doing right: now, You, know, there's been community visioning on this space.
You know you look at all the homes that were turned on to build it in the first place and at a pivotal time in this, where this community has said we're starting to think about and talk about what the space can be going forward into the future, whether it be parks or basketball courts, whether it can hold storm water, green infrastructure, parks, you know, Whatever.
You know it was delayed because of Covid-19 and because of everything that all of our community has been through, and now we're being essentially told is that we're gonna pay now for the privilege of having these massive 10 massive parking fields to cut our community into it's totally unacceptable.
You. Know on the you know, DOT should be able to clean and maintain bike infrastructure that it puts in regardless of whether or not they're charging people who live here to park.
You know free of the type of dumping that happens under the BQE if nobody's paying a park.
That's important for this community to know, because we expect those bike lanes to be put under the BQE like they were promised.
You know he's venting frustration that I think a lot of people have about the way that this was rolled.
We, wanted to hear what people's ideas were, whatever they were, but at this point, If you wanted to put in a park or basketball courts or open space or something that doesn't involve D.O.T infrastructure, there would have to be a comprehensive proposal on who is going to pay for that and who's going to maintain it, because we're certainly not in the business of maintaining those things.
As far as you know, in whatever the community wants, is basically going to need funding and whether that funding comes from, you know, state, the city or parks.
Just you know, I, want to point out, It, says: okay, The regs would be from long term from meeker between metropolitan to union, so long-term parking from 7 A.M to 7:00 to 10 pm at a dollar fifty per hour 15 hour, limit.
Just, want to you, know, point that out from 7:00 a.m, to 10 p.m, which is maximum four hours, which that's not even retail, Over there, so I'm, just like, and.
Okay, So it sounds like there's no set timeline or date for this yet, And can you explain you said that you know you can't maintain the facility unless it's metered, parking.
If this became a facility that has needed parking, we would deploy staff to go and make sure that people aren't blocking or dumping debris.
This is not that you know, then I guess, Maybe it would fall back to sanitation or somebody else, but we would not be maintaining this if it's not one of our parking, facilities.
As community board members, unless you know it goes through things, so I just want to.
I thoroughly agree that underneath the Williamsburg bridge is a dirty depressing place, but I just wanted to make note that it is also a very vital parking lot, especially with street cleaning.
How like short-term paid parking is going to benefit myself or anyone else in the community, and it does just feel the way this has been presented.
Now they're going to take away our parking and charge for outside people to come for like four hours at a time and then leave.
The process was not great for how we got here, but if I'm hearing you all right, you're saying that you're listening carefully and gonna and care about the feedback that you're getting from community world one and community board members in this process, which we appreciate and I hope that you're hearing that short-term parking isn't meeting any of our community's priorities or needs and I.
Well, You know, there's been years of advocacy and planning and organization from the community around how we can make Meeker move and have bike lane space and have open space and really brighten up and enliven.
What is but reading between the lines is that there's a budget crisis going on DOT, like everybody else, is trying to figure out how they can raise some revenue here and there and thinks that some short-term parking here would be beneficial.
If, that's going to entail the bike lane and the parking.
That's, what we would be talking, about, I, don't I think the thing that happened, that the point is that the community board comes back.
A plan, Then I do think it's important that we not kind of use extortionist methods to make decisions around parking when we have such urgent public space needs for our city.
So I think it feels really striking to hear that this is where you know we're putting capacity and resources to when the needs around bike lanes when the needs around shifting our priorities to thinking about the future of our city that is rooted in open public space, accessible transit, other types of a public transit that reach our communities is so urgent.
You know big ideas in terms of revenue generation in terms of transforming open streets into public spaces.
Another thing that we're experiencing is disappointment that some of the inspiring movements coming out of D.O.T itself aren't necessarily representative of the proposal and that you know the elements that that are kind of a perfect opportunity at this moment, not only as the community and the city is rethinking the BQE entirely, but we're also rethinking how to approach open space and public space.
You know the folks either from open streets or public plazas.
Think you know also what you're hearing is just a general disappointment from some of the things that the movements that have been coming from the city that are really forward.
I mean: Do you guys need the whole area to be open, space, Still thinking about parking on this area, like you planning to eliminate all the parking.
It's just there to be a kind of open space, I mean with a lot of initiatives or you're gonna still maintain some parking.
You, know, I think just realistically parking is gonna have to stay, but maybe not for the entire stretch.
You know there's a lot of things going on in the city right now.
So, all right, well, we'll hold them to coming back, and you know not doing this parking thing.
Okay, You want to state that a motion to even though they don't need our people, a motion to deny the plan as presented to the community board, How about a post.
Don't want to have necessarily a super long conversation, but you know the open streets.
So I just feel like those streets that had a community partner, you know, seemed to work better than the ones that were relying on NYPD to come and put up the horses and remove them.
Is it going to go back to community or to the city general park.
And I know some streets worked really well and others not so much.
You know NYPD with the community to get everybody talking and getting everybody on the right.
Frankly, on that stretch of street, which is a point of direct access to the water for pedestrians, So you know it's a combination of quality of life of the residents of my building, along with all the people that enjoy the waterfront, which, as we know, is a lot of people at this time, and so I just wanted to hear your thoughts on what may be a better solution than hoping that NYPD will help us enforce parking, which doesn't really seem to be working as a solution right, now.
And, I, think in the conversation that we had with Ben, that you know we felt like you had done all your due diligence you'd reached out to all the agencies that needed to be spoken.
Like I said parked there for such a long, time, There's.
You know that street, like when you first get off the bridge.
To your point, You know if there's a plaza and people are rowdy, we can certainly have security enforcing things there much easier than cars for sure, and if there's no alternate side, parking, there's no regs there, then it's even easier.
You know, because you're not removing parking technically, If there's no regulation, there.
So I think, like I, said before they're kind of being used as long-term storage by people in the community.
