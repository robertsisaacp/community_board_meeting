And I, think there were two things that we had mentioned: one presentation or discussion with the land use committee and or the executive or just the community, board.
I think we could do it both ways so that it's something that you guys can post up on your website and can be accessible for folks like the broader community, who can't attend this upcoming training, Just with everything going on.
I echo your sentiments if it's with the land, Use Committee or the board, who that audience should be we're targeting the last week in June for that and have a couple dates: we're thinking the 29th just because it's been like a standing meeting time for the internal group, but we're open to others that we can throw out there as well.
And I'm sorry, You know if I'm cutting in on anyone, if you were no contract, the way that it was that you were supposed to do like one meeting where you're showing.
That would right, I think what he's saying is that we stated we were going to do.
The committee, And I, think the executive board.
It I think we were proposing that one of the meetings is like a training that you can post online, which would be for the larger community.
They could be in whatever order meeting, but it was the executive board first, along with this committee and then the open to the public.
So the meeting that we're proposing with the executive committee and.
So in other words, We just have the one training with the executive board in this committee and then that would be filmed or recorded, and then we present it and show it to everyone.
We need to push back we're trying to finalize a bunch of materials to get you guys for review on the 12th, which is separate from this presentation in training, so I would propose I.
Just like knowing the way we work.
You know we'll work to document the 22nd right after the 22nd.
Is the executive committee meeting so any dates we'll have to.
Oh, god, I can't even think now that we're being discussed at the training right.
