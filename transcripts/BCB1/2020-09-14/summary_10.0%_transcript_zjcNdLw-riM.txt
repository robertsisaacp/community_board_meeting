There was a lot of discussion about making sure that we've done everything we can to protect this grass, and we have we've gone spoken with the landscape, architects and the maintenance team, every measure that we could was deployed, but the options become limited because what they pointed out to me that I didn't have in front of me at the land use committee meeting was that this area of the grass also falls within an easement held by the city and the state, as well as part of the necessary vehicular access path for the fire.
There was a lot of discussion about allowing some kind of out that retail inside the building might not make a lot of sense here and that people wanted to see outdoor dining here that put more eyes on it, use the space a little better, and so what that resulted in was removing one of the commercial entrances, and for that the zoning requires a densely planted screening buffer between the building and the public areas which would be required on the right.
This speaks to really the developers and their approach to projects like this as difficult as it is, and as we found it to maintain the grass and why we're here, going through this process to be able to repave the area pursuant to the previous authorization and the certification of these plans.
Think we, as David and Richard have said, have gone through a very complete process, with both parks and the other city agencies.
Okay, yes, so I just see that Katie had asked specifically different kinds of plantings in this area again compared to fern, which has next to it on the hill, which has ornamental grass the fact that this needs to remain a flat surface that can be driven on changes a bit of the topography and what we can plant out.
I just hope that you're not importing that on the developer, because I think we've been clear that this is not something we wanted, and it's Richard Lobel, just to kind of reiterate.
You, know I think that Elliot's really tried to go a long way to make this a really functional and enjoyable esplanade for the community.
I could not see the entirety of the question that was in the chat, But let me just reiterate what Richard said: we went through a dynamic process with a whole slew of city agencies about what this covering should be, and we, as you tried very hard to keep it grass or some equivalent, including astroturf, and everything else.
Let me just then, why don't I just say that we did have a public hearing and a land use committee meeting and the presenters have made my job very easy right, now, because sorry, just seeing just the point of order, do we have to close the hearing before we move into the to the meeting she's cheering right, now, Steve, she's, terrible.
Okay, So every 10 years the data is used to determine how many seats we need in each states to get out congressional seats right, And so this being said, because we only have, but.
Okay, If they did it later in the summer, they have to make sure that they do it again, because what happened with the post office being, you know, slowed down, A lot of mail was not received.
Thank you, but most of all, we just need help in getting this done, because, like I said, We are way behind all the other boroughs right.

It comes to the fact where they wanted to know more about the census, and some of them actually did their census, and then I spoke at Mccarran Park, as well.
Yes, As a matter of fact, I have right in my apartment, I have and what we could always do is if the person doesn't want to do it on your iPad, you can ask them to pull up the website on their phone.
We cover city workers, and so we are still trying to figure out why it is that people don't want to do a census, a lot of people when they speak about the census.
You know people don't realize that when you leave your house and you walk down the street, everything you see smell and touch is impacted by the census right and so, with the Covid-19 being so here.
My people are that I'm really looking out for is domestic violence situations, those people who are living in fear of doing senses, because you know, like I, said you have to reach out to the person to where they are not.
Was, Covid-19, Yes, I think that the funding was allocated somewhere in the first in the beginning of the second quarter of this year and started right when the funding was allocated and that's the funding that Barbara were mentioning and everything paused and the counters.
Why, it's important to a loved one who does have coded you know and will need services when it's time to recover, they were like.

However, Remember that word, however, in the event that elections can not be held according to scheduled outline in the bylaws and in order to provide continually board offices and attendance committee terms shall be extended until elections can be held.
We had a public hearing and a committee meeting, and it was with regard to the presentation that you all heard: earlier, 416 to 420 Kent, Avenue, so.
I will just mention that the committee members did express concern that we were not that the community board was not kept apprised of what was going on and the the applicants actually joined us and said that it was actually uncomfortable for them to have to come to us after the fact when everything was done, and they were very supportive of our sending a letter to the city and state officials, saying that look saying demanding that if any of the agencies either request or require a change in plans that we have approved, that we be kept apprised and be given the opportunity to be participate.
We had 10 people at the committee, It was when it came time to vote.
We couldn't access everybody, so the vote was was six to one six people in favor, one person against so I need a vote on that.
Then I will also need a vote on sending out the letter which we unanimously approved.
We need to vote on whether or not to approve the application and or to in favor of what the committee suggested.
Yes on the item that you're voting on and vote for, the other, Well, Dialys and I, don't know what you mean by two items: We just approved that application, but we also need I also needed a vote on I needed to vote also on sending a letter.
Okay, That's why I said you know we do both at the same time.
But I'd like to make a motion to admit, to amend the the recommendation that that the developer, trying to include plantings in the gravel area.
You know, based on the conversation that took place during the hearing, I'm fine, with amending it to ask the developer to try to add some more plantings, so.
Chesley would like to add to the recommendation that the developer, try to add plantings to the area that is going to replace the grass.
I mean you really it's going to be very difficult to tally, a vote where you're saying yes on one and no on the other.
Okay, so we're voting for three items, the amendment, the land use item and the letter of recommendations.
Yes, it's intended to go to agencies, basically calling them to revise their process that they should have notified the community board prior to this modification going through not after the fact and that in the future they should keep us as a part of the keep us in the picture so that they so that.
The recommendation is to approve the consensus of the committee with the additions, as stated by the committee chair right, though, Yes. Okay, So the your vote should be yes, no or abstain or abstention on the consensus.
You, know a lot, I'm not going to read the entire.
We, You know, get these reports coming through the board to our committee on a regular basis for volunteer cleanup, programs, Brownfield, Location, Super fund I, don't know if people are aware of this property, but it you know, it.
You know the main, the chlorinated solvent plume and extends about halfway into Berry Street, and they at this stage they're devising a remedial access, working, plan, Essentially, the means by which they're going to mediate its examination and that decision will be made in this month.
It's just you know, The health studies should absolutely be done and DC did not really respond to that demand, and so this, of course, was just kind of left in the current state that it is that they're just going to remediate the product in the report, which you can see online I.
You know additionally they're looking for a rate craze case, which is essentially a rate increase that they want from the Public Service Commission at the state level to help fund these last two phases to the amount 100,585 million dollars in energy and, what's called the north, No north Brooklyn pipeline coalition has basically generated thousands of voice comments and written testimony.
The focus of the resistance is on him right now, because one of the end goals of this pipeline is to reach a liquid natural gas terminal on Newtown Creek, which they want to expand and would essentially enable trucks to move the product to other areas like long island and out of state and those types of trucks are just incredibly volatile.
So the cult origins coalition is really putting on the mayor and the city to not issue that permit, and so one thing they also asked of us was for the board to write a letter to the mayor, urging him not to you know, to not issue a permit and to stick to the law, and so we're in a process of drafting that.
You know wean certain things out so, but please go through the list, because I don't want to hear about it after the fact that some bar that's been the horror of all times got approved by us.
An update to let us know, I, do not have anything down that you want to speak.

Marie Leonza is part of that following every trooper, that's living in the senior housing to make sure they're, okay, but delivering food taking care of needs that have arisen, the Bushwick generator, which I don't know what that is, but has provided food and support.
I, know I've seen so many board members here that have gone out of their way.
You know going into every line of this budget.
I felt an obligation to vote for in a sense because it was so awful that you know I felt like somebody had to do it, because it's not just one agency that gets funded in this budget.
Okay, I know that the mayor's office wanted to speak.
I, don't know if he wants to speak, but he did send written testimony.
We, ask everybody to send an email in advance to the office, so that we'll know you want to speak.
I want you to know that we have created our very first virtual event, which I will put in the chat.
I think there's still some kinks that need to be worked out before we make a final decision to move forward as to picking a date I go in and out chair people go in, and out.
Nope, The amendment, that's in the pipeline at the end of the report, so that you know officers terms will be extended until elections are held.
Julia Marty, the bylaw amendment says at the next available date, So it was nice today and at this time I really want to get off this computer.
Is the committee meeting I'd like for my committee to actually be able to sit down and argue it out simply because I know I haven't done, this.
I'd like to read section c elections in the bylaws item: 10 special elections in the event of an interim vacancy, A special election would be called the nominations and then a special election to be held at the next available meeting of the full board following nominations.
Having the nominations at the next meeting, which is October 13th and the elections in November right, yes, because we have a quorum of our bylaws committee right here.
We can have a community really, The committee should really reconvene to come up with a date of a vote and then in the term of officers and put it in the by-laws and make it exactly yes, but he said that in our last meeting we all sat there for two hours.
Think is Julia, saying that let the bylaws committee Meet and then real, simple and then the Bylaws committee will present this to the board in October.
We, as a committee needs to get together, decide on a date and look at your calendars and make sure you're available right.
Let's make sure it's in the bylaws, Please stop cutting corners people nominations Julia that you're available the next day, elections in November, meeting, yeah.
It shouldn't be six months, but my understanding is the Bylaws committee can meet and then can present the date to the at the next October.
And I know I'll, be in New. We could even meet in the office.
Right, so, The violence committee meeting will be held, and then you can vote on the states and make sure that in the bylaws that we don't have anybody saying we're just picking random dates to have elections, It will be concrete in the bylaws, June.
