Meeting important might be good for board members to see the president I spoke to Mary South they're gonna, put a we 're, gonna, put the presentation on the board's website, so anybody who wants to look at it before the name can look at it and review it before the board meeting, because we are going to make a vote on it.
We can't do a ballot vote, so you know I, don't have any problem by changing the board, But I think what I think what the budget look.
So I can see, with this executive board meeting that we are going off on somebody else's committee who hasn't even given a report yet like yeah I.
My, recommendation, I, don't think any members, as the committee had read prior to the meeting and the recommendation by Jan to put the voting off for a year was considered first and there so Jan's things were voted on and then mine were considered.
I didn't understand the whole thing, because I don't know anything about this right now, so is it that we're agreeing to have the whole board meeting down the day after election day?
If we're having a full board meeting that same week, it's going to be a week full of a lot of activity for people, including Election Day, on the 23rd.
The proposal table is Wednesday the 24th, that's what it is, how many people gonna do it on 24 Yes, sure, okay, the board legal would be 225 June 24th at 6 p.m. my virtual meeting, God helpless.
Is that election gonna happen before Can 30 know it can happen before which is gonna require yet another amendment of the bylaws, because it's going to June 30th date and again I'm be pre-emptive, because I think it requires a what the second.
So, we'll discuss what we want, but I, think the full board left has to vote on the recommendations.
I think it would be very good for the full board to see copies of the two proposals so that they can understand when the bylaws committee gives it recommendation what the two proposals are, rather than mckitten, That do the do letters, the letter from Jan and the letter for me to be part of the committee report, so that people understand exactly what the two proposals are.
