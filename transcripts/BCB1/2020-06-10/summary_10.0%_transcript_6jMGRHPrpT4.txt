We would add Trina's recommendations indicating that, if anything should have, because we still looking at maybe a year and a half of possibly coming up with a vaccination whatever that in the event that we could not have the elections whatever was going on, then we would look at him once a month I like moving forward in the event that there was not a resolution to this Kovach.
We can't do a ballot vote, so You know I, do not have any problem by changing the board, but I think what I think what the budget look.
So I can see, with this executive board meeting that we are going off on somebody else's committee.
My recommendation, I do not think any members, as the committee had read prior to the meeting and the recommendation by Jan to put the voting off for a year was considered first and there so Jan's things were voted on and then mine were considered.
Then we are going to have a presentation made to the entire community and we were talking about that same week to have this happen because we have to meet but got the deadline of June 30th to deliver to the board into the community.
If we're having a full board meeting that same week, it's going to be a week full of a lot of activity for people, including Election Day, on the 23rd, so we're talking with 22nd 23rd I was like it's going to be so crazy.
The beginning almost July The proposal table is Wednesday the 24th, that's what it is, how many people going to do it on 24, Yes, sure, okay, the board legal would be 225 June 24th at 6 p.m. my virtual meeting, God helpless.
That was the issue at the bylaws meeting You can't have a fair election process, so it takes it's.
Think it's not a fair election, but you can't meet two people.
So, we'll discuss what we want, but I, think the full board left has to vote on the recommendations.
It's outlined in the letter that I wrote , I think it's easier for people to see it, but it's an alternative proposal that allows us to vote remotely once obviously not at the June meeting.
