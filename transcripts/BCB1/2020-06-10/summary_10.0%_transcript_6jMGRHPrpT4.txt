Meeting important might be good for board members to see the president I spoke to Mary South they're gonna, put a we anybody who wants to look at it before the name can look at it and review it before the board meeting, because we are going to make a vote on it.
We have no way of people showing their hand on whatever, thereby redneck There was an article in the newspaper that said that we were having voting on suspending election until next year.
Let us do an election mailing out ballots and all that stuff They wouldn't do it requests to the bylaws committee The committee come to us with a recommendation, but no we vote on it.
We can't do a ballot vote, so you know I, don't have any problem by changing the board, but I think what I think what the budget look The bylaws committee is trying to do is come up with some come up with something that's best at these times that we're living in exactly you know So I can see, with this executive board meeting that we are going off on somebody else's committee who hasn't even given a report.
That's what it is, how many people gonna do it on 24, Yes, sure, okay, the board legal would be 225 June 24th at 6 pm, my virtual meeting This decided at the full board meeting that the board wants to proceed with an election Is that election gonna happen before can 30 know it can happen before which is gonna require yet another amendment of the bylaws, because it's going to June 30th date and again I'm be pre-emptive, because I think it requires a what the second The second proposal includes extending the officers terms on a month-to-month basis until the election cursed n't , you can't have a fair election process, so it takes.
And perhaps the borough president could advise us as to how you can help people are doing elections on WebEx The change in the bylaw would get rid of the need for a paper ballot which would be impossible and whether WebEx right now, the only recommendations from the Barlow committee was a girl of the year and the other things as well.
This is not gum, and hopefully we can get this information out and the board can read it like I just heard the bylaws committee have a recommendation board has to vote on it.
