Marie Jer is there any way we can put everybody on the screen going to good he'll, go to grid view. I. Did it's on okay, hey Tom, how you doing Tom they make third zoom meeting of the day. That's how we're living now my eyes are getting cross- eyed, that's how we're living two teams? Okay! So it's all good exactly somebody might be having too many devices near the computer about it phone. If somebody happens on the phone and they got a lot of devices by the phone. The property I need to know to come at the who cell from the Executive Board on the call party Needleman Simon so he's on, but he can't he can't go live I do not think I'm signed in yet I'm in we have a corn- Fed, Executive Board. The only person missing is how we do not communicate with the silent. His microphone is on. He says he's got it he's got in the chat. He has a problem with his computer Simon. You should be Simon, you should you should profit. Is their diet? Is their dialing number you call in yeah, so the only person missing from the Executive Board is Steve Weisberg Simon wagon, okay Simon, you came in by phone right. You're on the phone has joined the meeting I'm going to you on the phone. It's got announcement assignments on the meter. Let's get started, look like the only person. That's our Aslam on that's on I Steve is not on assignment. They announced that he was on. So we need to go over our gender. The items that we want to put on the agenda and how are we going to set up the agenda? Us7 stop. So everybody gives an outline of what the gender might look like. We got the meeting we got the moment of silence, got a roll call got approval of the Bennet. We got our gender, we got committee reports, we've asked them, we banks committees, they want to give a report to. Let us know if they want to give a report, then what we'll do as they come in? We will list the names on the committee that way because more have a seat sign- in as they send in the name, or they said in every point. We will list them on the community committee reports. There will be one two three, whatever your number is, if you're number one you'll be the first one to speak and the committee reports and then we'd have the parks minute, which is going to be as written Mary's going to send in your report and then we're going to send out. Then we do not do the public session and we won't that way. We'll have a list of people that want to speak and we will call out their names, though, because this is going to be totally different for everybody. It's going to be different on me and we're trying to lay out of we're trying to lay out where it will go as smooth as possible. So this is one of the reasons we laid out yet the like it is, and with the elect, expects them to write their lightly, submit their names whoever's going to speak, they will be listed. His name number one know what number they are. What the reports and speakers are we prepared to be able to do a full board meeting like this, or do we want to ask? Are we ready to do this? That is red is really going to be. Unless you have any other suggestions. I'm just wondering is the president have any people that they can do it do it? Does the city agents set up this site for us to do it? They keep telling us that another board meeting the other boys are meeting I do not know how they are running their meetings, but we tried the structured in a way where we could run the meeting as smoothly as possible, not any other any other suggestion. I just have a question. Yes, the Thanks yeah will the potential for any presentations, for instance, parks apartment, the you know they presented a new design for them for Bushwick in the park. It's something I think essentially voting on the floor. Board meeting important might be good for board members to see the President yeah. Let's wait a minute feel. Okay, feel your the parks go ahead. Yeah I want to respond to that. I spoke to Mary South they're, going to put a we're going to put the presentation on the board's website. So anybody who wants to look at it before the name can look at it and review it before the board meeting, because we are going to make a vote on it. But Mary has the capacity to put it to put it on to our website. People could stand into it and they could they could check the presentation out. So when we do vote on it, the regular board meeting you'll understand what's wrong. Well, if somebody's giving a presentation, they should be able to split their screen with us and show us the presentation as they're doing it. Okay, you want to do it on there later data, meaning you can do that. Oh my gosh I'm, just saying, if somebody, if somebody wants to give a presentation, they should be able to split their screen with us, but I can show it to us also, but a bit more be even more beneficial for them to get it to the point that Emma. So they can see it before just in case they can't do it. That's what I just said: that's what they want to do, but I'm saying they should be able to split the screen with us and show us during the meeting. Okay I do not see when I'll be a problem for that. Well, it'll be on the website for people to be with before the meeting, and she could have a presentation. It could be there during the meeting before we vote on it, not a problem. Okay and another bangles. The votes use that we have to vote on. We have no way of people showing their hand on whatever, thereby redneck. All the votes are going to be by roll call, and that's going to take a lot of time so prepare yourself. Gosselaar did I answer your question. Yes, thank you tell. Your pardon me looks like tails trying to talk when she's, muted I can't see they all on my screen. Yeah. You went away. Okay, so I have a question about that. There was an article in the newspaper that said that we were having voting on suspending election until next year. Is that that's something that the bylaws can both have a meeting about? You thought so my thought was I did not know. Rather than have you know, because we do not, we do not have the boat. No, we tried to work about he's, trying to get a burl Lourd. Let us do an election mailing out ballots and all that stuff. They would not do it requests to the bylaws Committee and they met on it. I do not know what they came up with, but they it's Marty. We recommended that in fact that we amend the bylaws to postpone the elections for a year. Okay got too much[ _ _], going on in the background yep. We would do what we always do. The committee come to us with a recommendation. The full board votes on it or they do not, but no we vote on it. That's what happened. So that's the way this will be handled so if they made that they made a recommendation that the boater should be suspended by a year it comes before the board. It has to be voted on yeah, actually it's more complicated than that, because it's actually effectively okay virus and then climate that we're in and we can't hold normal elections like we normally do. Oh yeah I see you shaking your head dude. We can not Balboa's called for us to have a paper ballot, but we can we. You know we vote on it. You got to have it roll call. We got to have everything because we can't duh, you know we could not do it by it like we always do it by paper ballot. So sleeve you saying there was two recommendations, but just a note there just a note that the postpone it for a year we require a recommendation or a vote. It's a hole through the bylaw change. Let's go through the whole bar law process. Do we vote on an amendment to the bylaws and suspend the voting for a year? That's the recommendation mark. Thank you. I was going to say yeah. There are two sets of amendments, one is for suspending the elections for a year and extending the offices forms and the other one is allowing for virtual elections and extending the official terms on a month- to- month basis into all the elections are held, they're both being presented by the bylaws, have any report no to recommend. No, when somebody said no nobody what I said. No, it was no Han seong, there's Marty there'll MIT, explain it. That's not what I heard. No, that's that I think these guys were right. It was fun after the co vs., given the time sensitivity of what is going on. We had agreed dad after that. We would add Trina's recommendations indicating that, if anything should have, because we still looking at maybe a year and a half of possibly coming up with a vaccination whatever that in the event that we could not have the elections whatever was going on, then we would look at him once a month Steve, that's what I understood from the meeting I think we voted to recommend, putting it off for a year right exactly and then with some more stuff that we said we were going up I like moving forward in the event that there was not a resolution to this Kovach. We would look at him I'm the month. We agree, but it was. It was voted on. That's right that we would okay, so my understanding is that the boat is to suspend the elections for a year, but you monitor month to month in case we have to go back. We can go back and have a full board vote in person. So some to side effect on Marty can I say something. Please I want it to be known. As a member of the Executive Board I will not system, I will not support suspending the elections for a year. I think the board has a right to have elections, whether they want to change the executive board. They want to keep it whatever. It is, and I feel very well you're, going to tell your entitled I have no horse in this race. I have no influence on this is in on this, but that you know this is what the Executive Board study budget, the Bylaws committee came up with. I have no opinion one way or the other I just know that the bylaws call for us to have a ballot vote in person. We can't do a ballot vote, so you know I do not have any problem by changing the board, but I think what I think what the budget look. The bylaws Committee is trying to do is come up with some come up with something that's best at these times that we're living in exactly you know, we do not have a hard enough time trying to have virtual meetings, so I can see, with this executive board meeting that we are going off on somebody else's committee. Who has not even given a report yet like yeah I did not. Even yes can I. Ask you a question. Yes, did you read the letter that I sent with them? The proposal that I sent to you, deployers I, read and that's of course, I read it and I sent it to the exactly our Budget Committee violence. I mean about us. I got me had it I sent it to the dialogue Committee. But what happened at the Bylaws Committee meeting is that they considered they did not Mike. My recommendation, I do not think any members, as the committee had read prior to the meeting and the recommendation by Jan to put the voting off for a year was considered first and there so Jan's things were voted on and then mine were considered. What I said had nothing to do with can't deport off her year and was the way of starting the two things were completed and they were to separate and the bylaws committee I think it makes sense. Excuse me we need to pick a date for the meeting before you know who the world is discussion. So let's do that we go through the agenda. You can take a vote on the agenda and we need a date. So I can do that meeting notice. We do not have a date. So let's choose a date for the executive for me and make it available for the board meeting. Yes, we talked about a full board meeting by virtual full virtual board meeting and I got an idea. Can you hear me why you Simon sorry y' all good, okay, Simon, yes assignment? Thank you. Did you want to say something Simon, oh yeah does concern, but I do feel that you can't do the other say an election and I understand I do I my right position. I understand the position of postponing I. Do full board vote on it at all. Can we take? Can we pick a date? Can we do that? First? What about the 16th have left the meeting? 16 June 16th, it's not enough time bad days. Oh yes, 5/3 answer! There have to be the eighties or we'll have to go into the week out of 22nd. The 18th is open 18th. Why do not we go to the 23rd I? Think? That's a good idea! Yeah! Yes, ok! Everybody Bebo! Did you get that 23rd? Yes, we all have to agree or disagree all right. The 23rd, it's Election, Day, 24, okay, Wednesday, that'll, work, yeah 24th is the day after the election yeah. Anyone here, hello, I'm idea, ok, I've been trying to I did not you did that I do not know what happened and I could not unyuu. Oh I was not able to understand the last part of what was said back in the B. I mean it's too far too long to go back now, because I've been trained of it. I was asking about this second option that I did not understand. I did not understand the whole thing, because I do not know anything about this right now. So is it that we're agreeing to have the whole board meeting down the day after election day? Yes, go born on June 24th, it's going to be a very interesting week because we are bringing to the table that the board Budget Committee has been meaning to discuss that Mr., Street presentation to the full board and the community we're thinking it's going to have to happen that week as well, Wow well, I think you had picked the 22nd and a 25th for those items. Yes right, Maria expert video, yes, my main thing with the Hester Street presentation, I think we should have a separate meeting for that and want to propose. We need to have them come present to the Land Use Committee to the executive committee, so that you all can see what they have come up with and with presentation. And then we are going to have a presentation made to the entire community and we were talking about that same week to have this happen because we have to meet but got the deadline of June 30th to deliver to the board into the community. So, if we're having a full board meeting that same week, it's going to be a week full of a lot of activity for people, including Election Day, on the 23rd, so we're talking with 22nd 23rd 24th 25th I just want to raise that. That's a good point and I'm sorry different, ask but I was trying to unmute it. I was like it's going to be so crazy. I see 3 ality is that Wednesday a 20 foot, maybe a peaceful day. Do it the following week is crazy. The beginning almost July yeah the proposal table is Wednesday the 24th, that's what it is, how many people going to do it on 24 I know couple: yes, all right, okay! Well, let's do it on 24th and Maria, maybe she's trying to set up your arm setup. You know sometime next week, well Hester Street. We tried to do it quicker, but then he kind of said that they would prefer to do it. That week we tried all ready for the meeting with them and those beats were the dates that we were given as potential dates. That's right! What time do we want to do the board? Do we still want six? Yes, sure, okay, the board legal would be 225 June 24th at 6 p.m. my virtual meeting God helpless. So let me ask a question and I'm sorry I'm, just trying to be preempted so I fit. This decided at the full board meeting that the board wants to proceed with an election. Is that election going to happen before can 30 know it can happen before which is going to require yet another amendment of the bylaws, because it's going to June 30th date and again I'm be pre- emptive, because I think it requires a what the second. The second proposal includes extending the officers terms on a month- to- month basis until the election cursed. Why months of this thing was the month? Why might the month? Oh well, it's just allowing for extra time to have the elections if it goes beyond June 30, so that could mean potentially that it would be September October when the board hopefully resumes and we're back to normalcy. Is that no I have no idea when we'll get back to normal? Absolutely that was the issue at the bylaws meeting it just so no feeling was. There was no heart, no terrible thing to keep the board as is, and had the elections in the normal ordinary course a year from now otherwise would have it. That was the feeling right. Simon wrote in the chat. I feel that you can't you can't have a fair election process, so it takes it's. Okay, let's postpone for you anyway. The issue will be voted upon on a full board. I do not know yeah, that's gotten the Chaton yeah I got it. Yes, we can't hear and talk for you over forever. Would you'd like to speak to what to just talk about climbing. Well I just said that I. Can you hear me? Yes, yeah. No IIIi heard what Dallas the Ellis said before I'm. Sorry, I'm, sorry, what the issue was brought up before about it's, not fair about postponing I, do understand it, but this I think it's not a fair election, but you can't meet two people. You know anybody any office whatever it is, but basically the full board will vote on it. So we'll discuss what we want, but I think the full board left has to vote on the recommendations. So it's up to the four board right yeah, yes, plus, we must keep in mind that we can't do our vote according to our bylaws. Our bylaws does not call for a virtual vote. Club elected office because we call for balance is that in order to amend the bylaws, you need to have a meeting of the ordinary course. The bylaws need to be amended either way, yeah Trina's recommendation, which would allow the voting I'm. Sorry as I understand it. The committee, the Bylaws Committee, did train a recommendation and that would allow for the rule, but that's what 2021? No. My recommendation was not 22, because the weeks recommendation Gina because we I did not I was not privy to the I- did not see the meeting. What was the recommendation? She, the first John Peterson, had written a letter recommending the election he put off Til 2021 postponed. She must follow strain of postponed and she presented what could be changed. His bylaws as a counterproposal I wrote a sip letter with the recommendation. Three different things allow us virtually if the next time we're able it's worked out and how it gets done, it may be the borough president recommend you can hold a virtual election, but the changes in the bylaws that I recommended I do I'm. Sorry do I have an echo. Yes, you do. Yes, you do have an echo okay, I apologize for my echo I. Do not I do not know, but then you might have a device. You might have a cell phone to stop. Next to your computer, know myself: okay, Audrina! Okay, maybe my letter could be shared. Maybe my letter in Jan's letter should be shared with the whole born and then that people could see the to recommending two different proposals. The modifications to the bylaws that were voted on in response to my proposal were voted as to be recommended that we get rid of that. We get rid of the need for paper ballot and that, secondly, that the terms that he often Thurs be extended on a month- to- month basis until elections can be held and then to allow for elections to happen. It's about the Stowe elections and get me up the bird in dealing with the vacancy rate so allowing basically allowing for a special election to take place when we're ready. It's all. It's outlined in the letter that I wrote, I think it's easier for people to see it, but it's an alternative proposal that allows us to vote remotely once obviously not at the June meeting. Maybe at the June meeting there can be nominations and maybe no one will be nominated, but then the next time we meet be that if we were meet remotely in July or August or in September, we could then hold the elections. And perhaps the borough president could advise us as to how you can help people are doing elections on WebEx, but the change in the bylaw would get rid of the need for a paper ballot which would be impossible and whether WebEx right now, the only recommendations from the Barlow committee was a girl of the year and the other things as well. But it still all has to go through the whole process of Bylaw amendment. So it's just a recommendation from the community and then even the executive committee can't rule on it completely. That has to go through the whole process for fire. Emblem was in a vote on what on the recommendations of the Bible, yes and the pilots, many recommend will read that's why so? Why? So? Why we? Why we going over the snow is this was a recommendation, was voted on and move on. Why we go back what I want to eyes Tina? Why you discussing this issue now it was voted. A mystery, not asked Simon I asked what were the two options, because I did not hear what was going on by the bylaws Committee and I guess she was answering okay. Thank you. Trina welcome and also the bylaws committee did vote on my recommendations and voted to recommend each of the three different changes. Modifications to the bylaws. Those should be part of the recommendation to the only question would be, and we can always if we adopt and it's through a whole process anyhow to adapt. These bylaw amendment meant to do a subsequent one. If we want to have a election prior to the next June, is there the statute on this matter? I just know anything again. I think it would be very good for the full board to see copies of the two proposals so that they can understand when the Bylaws Committee gives it recommendation. What the two proposals are, rather than mckitten, that do the do letters, the letter from Jan and the letter for me to be part of the committee report, so that people understand exactly what the two proposals are I agree with that with the report right now. Is he still teaching about wicked? What thank you is there any other discussion on this matter? Do we do we approve of their gender? Yes, okay. The agenda has been said. Nobody has everybody satisfied with the way we go, try to transition virtually with this, but this agenda this is not gum. This is not going to be easy and I see that from this meeting it's going to be some long discussions and hopefully we can get this information out and the board can read it. So they do not come to the meeting and do not know what we're talking about so you're, like I, just heard the bylaws Committee have a recommendation board has to vote on it. Is there anything else? No any other questions. Nope yeah a question: will the perks committee every well that will Arps be presenting the motiva? I came a little late to the meeting trailers Phillip, yes yeah, so God will do a priest. A college I do not want to keep someone's up, but also Mary's, going to put it on our website who can view it even before the meeting and then we'll present it at the meet because I know when we had a meeting there was. There were comments that were made in the shop that were not addressed and so I think it's important, no motive. Let you try an ample time to look at it at their own leisure, not just at the board meeting. I'm going to work that out with Mary tomorrow, if Committee, if the committee's got stopped and that they anything that you got in your report, that the board need to look at I would advise you to get it to the office as soon as possible. So people can't come to the meet and say I did not look at my computer. I did not look at my emails, so I would advise everybody to get their reports to the office as soon as we can get them out, so that people can have time to look at because you know I do not know how this meeting this do not go. You know we're not it, but not achromat. Experts at this will be our first food to our full meeting. I do not know how it's going to go, but I'm, hoping that it will go as soon as seamless as possible and I asked everybody. I asked everybody bring their patience that is needed. Yeah. Have a motion to adjourn second motion to adjourn thanks: everybody good night, good night, safe everybody, aye.
