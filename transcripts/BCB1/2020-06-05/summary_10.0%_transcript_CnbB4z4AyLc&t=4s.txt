Okay, reason for our meeting is changes to our bylaws and regards to the election, see so And we're not able to vote, and these procedures need to be changed in these bylaws.
The, if other major situations like a hurricane or power failure or something we're not able to meet when we're supposed to have nominations or elections having this ability having this all this alternative having this tax gives the board the flexibility to adjust to those events.
Why is a second aboard not in place they're still in place You know what I'm saying is to have a vote and we have to meet month by month.
What his letter stating to do it in a timely matter, considering your bylaws, a Bible or state, we were supposed to have our nomination committee in May. The election should have took place.
We need to keep my executive board in place for the time being, while we're in the midst of this pandemic, and this is Julia forces speaking I'm, not speaking for anybody else and then have all these bylaws change, and, let me just say another thing: If I may David, neither man I'm.
Trying to miss a vote, that's all I see Trina submitted the other amendment proposal for having virtual elections and extending month officer Keats until the elections, America.
Let's go to this one, going to the next one's to you, know, vote.
The same thing: Well Jan had made a motion that we would continue on with the Executive Board, the way it was, and we still would have to vote on the other issues.
The election will be held at the regular meeting of the board in June and then the amended text.
It says the terms of all elected officers of the board meeting shall commence on July 1st.
The nominations and the voting this month, and if we did not, we potentially extend maybe one month It's just going to take too much time of this executive board when we're only supposed to meet exact and like I said in July and August But in September, we still might have to have physical, distancing here Yes, so we stop jumping around from people to people, and we just have use what we got until this.
Please I want to move the agenda to the second arm, reading, all right vote on the first one, but Let you go ahead on to the second, the other five changes at one time we were trying to vote individually, be sure and be clear.
Three time should be set aside at the June meeting, and the new text is, with the exception of June 2020 and then going back to the existing tax prior to the election for candidates who choose to address the board.
Okay item three times should be set aside at the June meeting prior to the election, but we're not having elections as we did not have nominations.
Okay, 2020 There, should be time set aside at the June meeting prior to the election for candidates who choose to address the board.
You know at the beginning said where it says: aside at the June meeting, it says we're proposing, with the exception of 2020 , that's the proposed change, okay, so in other words, in this month of June 2020 the side until later in the years that would you St. in yes Julie eating that we should set residing store the exception, except for June 2020.
Do we have to make the other changes right now when we already voted to set it aside until next year, so we're not having an election?
The Elections Committee shall prepare the official ballot for use at the June meeting.
Nine number: nine under C terms of all officers elected at the board, so election meeting shall commence on July 1st of the year and expire in June 30th of the found year and the new text, with the exception of the year 2020.
The bylaws need to be changed from paper ballot to us being able to vote remotely and y' all hear me, everybody I'm, so down Trina that in order to allow what we could do is make the executive extend the term of the Executive Board month to month, so that people until we have a mechanism in place where we can vote yeah remotely to connect nomination.
You do not change the paper ballot into a remotely vote, and then we do not have to extend the terms for a year.
Do we need to call a vote on the ballot as it was plotted about whether we want to change it or not?
You know you Marty stated he wanted to stay with paper ballot, and that means not changing the bylaws right.
Make, a motion on what I just read, Section, C or nine, and what's the motion to prove the proposed tax change to that amendment, The terms of all officers elected at the board's election meeting shall commence on July 1st of the year expire in June 30th of the following year.
