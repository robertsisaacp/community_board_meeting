The election will be held at the regular meeting of the board in June, and the proposed connect these with the exception of June 2020, where the elections would not be held but postponed until June 2021 This modification is because of the impacts experienced by the co vid 19 pandemic, implementation of NYC II NY, yes and US guidelines requiring communities to pause and shelter sheltering in place mandates.
We don't know what life is gonna be like in a year the if other major situations like you know like a hurricane or power failure, or something we're not able to meet when we're supposed to have nominations or elections having this ability having this all this alternative having this tax gives the board the flexibility to adjust to those events and I.
We need to be able to change our bylaws correctly to have the remote thing in place into the Bible Without that just do our nomination in the month of June, the month of June should have been the election, so we are already behind that's what his letter stating to do it in a timely matter.
So baby's gonna, try and call okay , The bylaws say the terms end on June, 30th, Nena by law, say the terms and June 30th, but we can extend it Yes. Mr Tolar, mr wonderful nomination, which was last month an election Let's take a vote, so I made so I vote for the emotion who made the mouse in you First, one is the extension of the executive board for another till June to read it next year and so texted I read At a time we weren't gonna vote on all of them as a whole.
The same thing: well Jan had made a motion that we would continue on with the Executive Board the way it was, and we still would have to vote on the other issues so I, okay, without we have no basis to vote on that It's just to state that generally, we have to go through each proposed amendment.
Whoever is elected, carry on We need to keep these people in office until we get ourselves together with this weapon right It addresses the nomination, the miss nomination date and in voting in the election it just allow allows to do both virtually and, if necessary, and the officer terms you know, and what the month basis If we act now, it would just second, we won't even have to extend if we do the nominations and the voting this month, and if we didn't, we potentially extend maybe one month Jumping around from people to people- We will be in place totally in place to vote correctly and have our bylaws changed correctly, and everything would be done correctly.
Reading all right vote on the first one, but Let you go ahead on to the second, the other five changes at one time we were trying to vote individually, be sure and be clear Let me just read: This is season section, C elections.
Part three time should be set aside at the June meeting, and the new text is, with the exception of June 2020 and then going back to the existing tax prior to the election for candidates who choose to address the board remarks.
I just read the second one This is the one he's saying it's still the first one to put the election off until six one of twenty these all five of these are related to that we have to vote for, and we agree to that.
I can't make the motion The bylaws need to be changed from paper ballot to us being able to vote remotely and y'all Trina that in order to allow what we could do is make the executive extend the term of the Executive Board month to month, so that people until we have a mechanism in place where we can vote yeah remotely to connect nomination What we I am I, can agree with you.
that I think we're talking about a new norm and I get what she's saying, but what I wanted kind of solution to month to month do all these changes we gotta get my green people Now. We don't even know, what's gonna happen in here from now, what we're voting on so if it is whether we're gonna vote virtually for now on, is making the recommendation whether gonna go with that and Marty put it out there that he votes for paper, ballots and I think we should vote on Trina's most arm suggestion Let me read to you what it was What.
Second, a second all right So when you make the motion Jay a second Marty, the noise, okay, abstain and it's the terms of all officers elected at the board's election meeting However, in the event that elections cannot be held according to the schedule outlined in the buffaloes and in order to provide continuity or to officer and attendance committee terms, Steve do you have you can read it because I all right, yes, section c9, the terms of all officers elected at the board's election, meaning shall commence on July 1st of that year and expire in June 30th of the following year, and the new tax is whether, in the event that elections cannot be held according to the schedule outlined in the bylaws and in order to provide continuity board officer attendance committee terms may be extended month to month until elections can be held.
