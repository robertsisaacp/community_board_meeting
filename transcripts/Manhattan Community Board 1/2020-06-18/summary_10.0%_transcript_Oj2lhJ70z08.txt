Tonight we have some young people who live in our community with everything that's going on in a country and the world right now, we'd like to have a discussion about it might take many directions: I'm, not even sure what direction it will take.
We know, what's going on I'm, going to turn over the discussion right now to two young people who brought it to our committee.
Yes, I, think you do Katie yeah, so Taylor has the presentation I'm waiting for her to pull that up and get that started.
Sorry I just want to say Juana we're moving up to number one and I got a few calls about the title of this agenda, which is addressing systemic racism and white supremacy and Battery Park City, and a request was made that we changed this white supremacy, because that sounds like it's a neo-nazi group and so maybe just addressing systemic racism and what changes we might like to see take place and take out the terminology.
I did bring the topic, admittedly I'm, not very well versed in it, which is why it was you know really wanting to have representation from DEP, so I think so greatly for coming.
My concern in having received some information through other committees with related to our 911 health, was that we there are some concerns with sewer overruns, and you know our Beach water, our swimming water, our rivers and just you know inviting umberto to help us to understand what that's about so I'm going to find an Bert, oh he's on the phone.
Rainwater collection system, if you will, is combined, meaning that there is one sewer pipe right which carries the sewage from the from all the properties, whether it's businesses or residential units, and it also carries the stormwater runoff rainwater to one of our 14 wastewater treatment facilities that we have in New York City.
As we know, we don't want this wastewater going on to the receiving bodies of water, because it can create a bad situation for recreational use and I'm sure.
But, like I, said before, we continue operations in terms of installing new sewer mains, making sure that we review operations in the in the wastewater treatment plans, in addition to long-term control plans that we have agreed to with the state, as I mentioned before, those could be either as we call grey infrastructure or green infrastructure, gray infrastructure, meaning more pipes, more filtration plants and whereas the green infrastructure meaning more green rain gardens as we like to call it where, as we plant more trees and more plants and more green catch basins, if you will, instead of catch basins that you see in the street corners, basically just as a sponge to absorb the rainwater as it is raining, the basic idea of that is to contain the rainwater, as is raining.
So that's one way that we are basically helping improving the waterways within these New York City areas be just a couple of and I don't want to take too long.
I know you have other agenda items and I know you have questions, but now that I hear that there's other you know, there's obviously committee members just a couple of simple things that I think are very helpful, especially and what we are all going through right now, but I'll start with one.
Basically, it means that when we have a heavy rainstorm, I would suggest and hope that everyone can participate, whereas if you are listening to the news- and you hear that in the weather- news that there's going to be a rain storm, what I suggest is when it is occurring that you all wait in terms of using a large amounts of water.
The second thing, which is important right now and we obviously are all dealing with kovat and we as DEP the agency, ensures that we make sure that actually we make sure that we provide you with clean and safe drinking water, but at the same time we're all using disinfectant wipes.
Lastly, I'm sorry, I do ramble, but I opened myself up to questions, but lastly, in terms of swimming and beach season, I did include that in the email that I sent to Lucian, basically the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene also does their own testing of the waterways of beaches.
Even you know bovid and this everything that happening right now, okay, in terms of recreational use or talking about summer being upon us and you can't go in the water yet in New, York City right, but so we're still, you know being near the water.
I was trying to give some general information, but I can definitely answer your question so and I'll start off by one other note in terms of New York, City drinking, you know drinking water supply, it is safe to drink.
Regarding recreational activities, I understand everybody wants to go outside and obviously we're moving into Phase two in New York City in terms of DEP.
But the water quality is done by the Department of Health, but, as I said before, the waterways, around New York City, is cleaner than it's ever been before, and I urge everyone to take a look at our DP website.
But that is not for us to you, know, determine or advise people that they can or cannot go up on that so I think I saw stirring on New York one and maybe I'm mistaken and maybe I'm correct that they were mistaken.
Did you see that story on New York, one or anyone else did see the same story and I also shared I, initially learned of this topic, I shared an article in Chicago yeah and can I add something Pat and Mariana that I just shared in the chat that there's a webinar tomorrow on this very topic on Cobin 19 to tection and wastewater streams, as it was a way of an advance warning, so I would love it if that could be addressed here.
Yes thank you and if I could just finish by saying that you're referring to wastewater, not waterways, where we've had conversations with Manhattan borough president's office where we are gearing up to test for the kovat in our wastewater and that would be able to help us to track and trace, but in terms of the waterways that is not I, believe what you are referring to.
We know what areas are have or can be, are likely to be in danger of kovat, or we can tell the a trace the high volumes of cases of kovat so I'm, sorry, if it's in the waste water and it goes to the treatment plan in the treatment plant, can the kovat didn't see removes of the water killed.
If you know you have, it is likely traces in the sewage, yes in terms of treatment and or how should I say didn't make right contain containing the kovat.
That's something we're gonna have to work with the University I'm, not sure, if that's something that I can discuss now or something possible again, the agreement or the or where we're trying to go to in terms of this new process is just basically to trace it.
You, though, is how dangerous the safest place to be right now, rather than being on you know, on the street there sharing the street with a bunch of other people and an airborne virus I mean I, could put you guys on the harbor and kayaks I'd love to I, can't because I don't have a beach.
Obviously, as I stated before, we are working with several universities, including NYU Stanford University, and we're trying to come up with a testing technology here that is best suited for this type of virus, and we want to analyze the data and assess it and to use that data to help us with these health issues in the future.
Waterways might actually be open this year, or should we be looking to 2021 before we you know can expect that the coh would say there might be open like do you guys have an inclination as to whether or not that time may come this summer right?
Two in terms of the beach season from what I'm hearing yes, they do want to open it right now.
I just was identifying this panel tomorrow on this topic, making sure everyone was aware of it and which I've shared in the chat and to just thank you very much for taking this up Mariana and Pat. We will certainly follow up in the Environmental Protection Committee and jointly look at this on the specifics of the waste water question in Copa, 19, pretty fascinating stuff, thanks very much okay, so I'm gonna.
One thing I don't want to you know talk for too long, but one thing I'll say is that we have a funding plan that we have in a yearly basis and a 10 year, capital plan, where we always invest in installing new water mains and new sewer mains.
That's done on the ability for the infrastructure to handle those kinds of things before developer is given approval to build a new high-rise building and I'm, focusing on 250 Water Street in the fact that they're trying to make that happen, which means that a lot of our pipes and stuff, you know or I mean I'm gonna have to be done or extended or something.
You have to allow it some time, but very simply, if there's flooding street flooding means that the city sewer can't handle the rainfall you can follow through on one service request, let Lucien know or myself know, number two.
But again, yes, you have to allow some time for rainfall after a couple of days, if you have a bad street where it's still a lot of stagnant water ponding, you know that's something that we can take a look at and it can be filed it in 301.
If that's what it's been determined to do, but with regard to not only the committee but globally and this issue I think we have to be very careful and walk the line of what proper terms are as deemed by the government what words they're using and the black community yeah very careful about trying to protect the feelings of either people sometimes are guilty.
By far too many families like mine, Beverly Allen, our other mother I, do make an American, wife and mother of three who built her life for her kids in Brooklyn, New York in part by commuting to this neighborhood to work a job taking care of my sister and I, our parents and our grandparents.
Again, we watched as protests against structural racism, white supremacy, violence on black lives, especially by the police, pick up after years of black organizers, protesting for the same thing, equality and justice and end to police violence that has killed two disparate disproportionate number of black people in this country.
Basically, the answer seems pretty obvious to me is something we want to talk about tonight, but it feels like it's white people's lives that are being protected at the expense of black people's, and this is relevant to this community board because it happened right here in our community.
Let's talk about this, you know: where can we offer something better, something loving and something just, and we also hear a lot and we ask our sweet we're asking it ourselves, you know what can we do as like people to make a difference right, but so many answers have actually been given to us by people of color they've been in many ways, and this is something that I wanted to consolidate for us.
I will defer judgment on whether or not this is going to be the moment that, finally, everyone will understand exactly what's happening in the black communities around this country with regards to policing and over policing and militarized policing I after Ferguson, it's hard to hold your breath, it's hard to hold your breath when you know a 12 year old kid gets gunned down with a toy gun and the city that you grew up in, as was the case for me with Tamir rice and the city kind of just kind of shrugs.
We talk LGBTQ issues, we talked about gender class, a it give me a space to continue this long overdue conversation and then also a place where this committee can continue to talk about the reforms that we are seeing passed in our state and our city I'm, really glad that they passed its thanks to all the organizers and our elected officials.
It could be a place where, in host town hall, town halls with experts, I think we are in duper one very soon and the fourth one is request that we provide a space for a memorial in Battery Park City, with names of unarmed black Americans killed by the police.
There was one of the things about no like I agree with no arrests for the protesters and peaceful protesters, maybe just because, unfortunately, there were people on the extreme right and the extreme left that we're trying to hijack this righteous movement.
You know a distinction, yeah and I agree with you, I like yeah, okay, so I think that the point is, you might want to put peaceful protesters inside of it.
What some of the programs that I listen to on how black people deal with white aggression and race relations and things that have been happening are, is the fact that America is American.
The other side of that is in terms of policing over a period of time, and in that whole scenario, policing has been used as a force to control, whoever you know, and so here we are, and police have been given the right away for many years and the establishment has looked the other way and we are where we are so I think that education, starting from the root of the roots of American history, would be a very good thing.
I think you might want to consider maybe just narrowing the focus to New York City black people who have been killed and look at like Abner, Louima, Eric garner.
My point is to keep it local and I'm sure you're, probably you might get a better response, not to say that I think all the names should be listed, but that's happening in other parts of New, York, City and then coordinating with the first precinct would be a good idea in terms of the protesting issues that you want to you know and that you want to have happen in this area.
I think that if you reached out to them and say we have this idea, you know in terms of the protesters down here this and that any other whatever so I think you guys are great for starting the conversation, and you have a lot of wonderful idea and I am happy that you will keep hope alive and that something will happen in terms of the beginnings of talking about race relations in the United States, the well, a community board gwon the United States, and it is just not here it's all over.
Thank you in having this conversation, and so there may be a way that we can organize, and maybe we show the borough president and see if we can organize a Manhattan I mean it's happening all over the city, but you know one step at a time that maybe there's a way we can organize meeting with Manhattan community boards and any you know and the public to continue the conversation.
So can I add something to what my what Francis said that okay I was just doing some research while she was talking and I mean I couldn't agree more, but even though it's in Brooklyn, but not in Manhattan, the last fort in the city, Fort Hamilton, the government denied the like the city councils are some people of our year too.
I! Do I just want to thank both Katie and Taylor for the great presentation and the hard work that went into doing this I also would recognize their cousin Claire, who was behind the scenes and a lot of the stuff that they've been doing I think she's a that she's on the attendee list.
But if that's the case, I support those as a favor framework and because I just want to say to that conversation, it's personal to us here in Battery, Park City, because that's where we live and that's what my girls grow up and that's what talking about.
I think it was you Pat about making this to the other community boards and bringing it larger, because the conversation has to start and the Jen sees and the Millennials need to step up and take over the reins and a lot of them are doing it and a lot of them aren't and I just love the fact that they're coming forward and I want to see their friends and their colleagues and their classmates and their whatever getting more involved, because it's not gonna change unless everybody gets involved, and that means voting - I'm done.
The with the Indian Wars I, think that we need to you know just look at our monuments and question them and look into that so but think about general Worth's like opal ask, is that there's I think he's buried underneath it, but that's also not in our district, but we should definitely look at what is in our district and meaning that you're worth three.
If I could, if I couldn't do shit, if I could just say for me, I just want people I'm not advocating tearing these things that on what they shouldn't be glorified I'm, advocating having them in a museum just like when I'd like you go to the Holocaust Museum, and you see these terrible atrocities on display so that you don't forget or the Peace Museum in Japan, and you see these like melted bicycles and little kids of you know so: I'm not advocating having them disappear, but not being glorified.
There are other things to really think about, because your thinking is amazing, but we have such a cultural history in lower Manhattan that we can actually be a part of a future dialogue that African burial grounds in lower Manhattan show, from the very beginning, stages of what happened to the African experience in New, York City and in America.
Think outside your neighborhood, because we've got lots of really great things, east and west to take a look at make sure that when you're thinking and proposing you do it someplace that you feel will have not only the greatest impact for the people themselves, but that more people will see it right.
Clearly it was important to this committee and to the board that you have an opportunity to speak, but I just want you to know how important it was to me as an individual that we hear not only from you specifically, although that was super important to me, but that we hear from young people I think we have to face facts again.
We have people, colleagues, friends, family members who unfortunately, are passing away from you know this is a 911 affected community and we're losing a lot of our historians on a personal level right the people who knew these stories and who had this information, and that means that we have no choice but to hand the baton to the Millennials to Dinsey.
So that said, there are avenues that we can look into, maybe are not from our community, but I've seen some things in the larger community, for example, Yale is offering a free class I, don't know if it's already begun, if it's too late to get into, but with American history and specific -, as it relates to African Americans from the Emancipation Proclamation.
Think that speaks to some of the proposal that you were making yeah I had clarified earlier that, with regard to the arrests and everything, arrests had been made to my knowledge as well, but I did see the New York State District Attorney sign banks say that he was not going to prosecute any protesters.
You know I am the South Street Seaport I receive you know the people I think that we should have some sort of plaque or some educational information at all of these places.
Okay, we won't like further prosecute you, but that by no means should they have been celebrated, I mean that's, it's outrageous and you know Mariana could turning the flag stuff after World War, two Germany didn't just say: okay with it's part of our history, they, but they ban Nazi flag, which was the I'm an enemy combatant, and it should be this.
It just slap in the face so anyway reading something when you hear me: yes, I want people, because many people don't know that a lot of those thanked the Jim Crow South because of the they were afraid of losing power after the you're right, so we'll leave it at Tim Crowe.
Yes, I'm sorry wanted to converse with questions and come back to you, okay, so what I wanted to say is what happened.
So. I really think that what I would like to offer here is that all of us should really come together in some way that allows us to move our whole culture in our whole world for the best and to open everyone's heart in this and to find some kind of purpose that humanizes everyone and so I.
And so our opportunity is to end, ask and answer the question: how to be a human being and for all of us to be the best human beings we can possibly be so that's my comment and I want to thank Katie Ann Taylor for the presentation, because I was really touched by the effort.
However, those things don't happen a lot, so education is something that does evolve and that perhaps we can impact and that should be brought up to the state, also Sarah, because unfortunates, that's, like I, think the New York stated Jeanette were under one umbrella.
I know my dad was in the State Education Department 20 years, so fighting in the 70s I agree with what you said, though, all right so I don't see any more hands up.
I. Just kind of wanted to respond because I saw in the chat that there was concern about the word white supremacy and what it means and I know that for most people, what comes to mind when you think when you hear the word white supremacy is like the KKK and like more violent individuals, but also that what that it is a person who genuinely believes that white people are superior and I just want to echo what black activists have been saying and also I noticed that there were some other people who are commenting as well like Maruyama and Pat mentioned in the comments too, and in there with their voices too, that it is referring not solely to violent individuals and a personal philosophy, but to a structural issue that goes to the foundation of the country.
Absolutely redlining is the practice in which, so it's actually I think going with a more visual explanation helps because it was done visually, so they would take a map of the city and they really draw a red line around certain neighborhoods or down a street and say on this side on this side of the red line in the red area.
Can anybody come right here me know you can hear you tisha see you yes, I first want to say thank you also to Taylor and Katie and Claire what an amazing presentation it took a lot I have so much respect for you, I'm really excited to that you'll be working on this I hope to get my girls involved too.
We are going to be working in conjunction with other community boards, so it has more impact I want to just to let you know that, for all that would be interested in attending.
I'm going to be announcing about some of the things that they're advocating for comment and then I think about okay, yes, so first two to Sarah and Trish's comments and points.
Maryana I want to ask you a question because I actually like I agree with couldn't, did that been like, since they were basing it on the majority of people immigration stories.
In my opinion, and now more than ever, you need to give these kids the information so that they can say I had no idea that that's helped my black classmates, some of them got here and I didn't know about the islands and the culture and the slavery that happened in other places where people came from and I did not know about the civil war, which is absolutely appalling.
I think it goes definitely to character, and when and what kind of places we you know who we feel we can trust with a license and who we can but there's been issues basically is what I wanted to get to where LGBTQ issues have come up and I'm a straight woman but I dressed them to the extent that I'm able but I, think that we need to do more.
You know, if you would have me the especially like you know, moving on, but with that sort of topic and the larger issues and educating people as to what's really going on I think we should spend the next 15 minutes talking about how we would like to go.
We want to approach borrow board so that we could end and approach our president and see if we could organize a town hold together, a convention of some sort for Manhattan, where we can talk and possibly put forth a resolution that comes from our entire borough and all someone give me how about the points that the young, the two young women, are like.
Those four points how about if we just like, if everybody agrees that we just support that you know the points that they think we're done, I would second what Mitch said.
I think we need to do something, and if everything you said yes, but I, don't think we should let a minute go by without having this board speak.
So we need to sweetie to speak from this committee to bring it to the full board and especially that the least less controversial parts and what I'm looking at is controversial might be the memorial and Battery Park City everything that they said and at the memorial I.
You know the word just Edward peaceful before the word protest is and then I think everything clicks in every box they brought up agreed yeah I mean that I would say, I agree with you and even then I like the idea rail I just would hold off on where we said to place.
I, don't know that we actually need to useful I agree with Mitch cuz people are gonna, push back and say well the looters that are datsuk.
I'm sorry I, don't know if it's out of turn for me to speak just in reference to this I know that I know that the way that people code- something that comes up a lot and regardless of my own opinions, I mean personally I- would like everybody to be released, but the question that I have that, regardless of how we personally feel about how people should protest or how we choose to respond to the way people choose to protest is a isn't.
So speaking of black people, men, whatever how you want to classify it, who've been murdered in this city right.
What y'all say do like do a quick vote and then we, you know, do a quick, raise your hand or say something: I want to say that if there is anyone who objects to leaving it as protesters, you got.
Okay, Danny ham, right I still would like to know so.
If they need to also be stated in resolutions, then yeah we stand with the two meetings were the memorials and then starting a committee specifically talking about race and justice.
We include that in this reso, or is that a separate asks that we send out a letter and possibly again I think that we need to use our boroughs president, who is extremely helpful in many cases and I'm sure that if we presented this to her, she would be equally interested in pursuing it.
In with this thing it doesn't does it doesn't preclude us from then doing something more specific after that, does it no because I think you ones you'll keep the momentum going by every month revisiting the subject, instead of you know, kind of getting it all out and then not having anything else to talk about here, but also there's some other committees that you might want to work with on this okay I.
This is how it should be supplemented, and this is what it doesn't look at, and you know I think there's a way to really have them understand.
We might want to reach out once again I said to these unity boards and see if they work with us and we have, we might have streets around in Manhattan, I'm, not sure Pat I just sent you the I sent you the email with that information in Fort Hamilton Brooklyn.
You have your hand up yes, I'm a hand up before, because I just wanted to ask how we could start a working group that maybe could turn into a committee to continue this conversation or would that happen in this committee?
I definitely am going to introduce your topic tomorrow at the executive committee meeting and you might want to be there to say a few words and possibly ask that question there right now.
Yes, like I, said we could either decide that that's something we want to take up and have our own form a task force to pursue that topic.
That sounds great with that for the names the names is that what you just said, Lucien have a question before, on gender number, five has state of policing in New, York, City, discussion and possible resolution.
You know the city level, the state level, the federal level so I think next month, we'll still have a huge topic to discuss specific to policing right, okay, so yeah, because this is this- is a little light on the state of policing.
You could say that support of police reform at all levels of government and just because you're kind of leaving it vague, and then you can be more specific next month when you look at these tactics under a microscope, sounded that because I like I'd like us at some point, if the Senate doesn't, you know, make a change on their own to call upon the Senate I mean we have representatives of the Senate here to call upon the Senate to pass the house is bill agreed again, it's a quarter to nine.
Sam. You said every time you do the presentation you'll get a little more comfortable and if you'd like to all night, you have the executive committee meeting and you might just want to tune in, and you know, depending on how the meeting is going, I may ask they awarded two okay.
Well, so we have this thing's decided so I think that yeah there's one thing, and that is not a resolution, but just to get your comments together for tomorrow's meeting on the open, dining on the sidewalk they've already started by me, like one of the items that came before licensing impairments that we actually denied at 77, Fulton Street, four test a wall street they've started I.
So I don't know if they got permission or not, but on Gold Street today I saw several tables having been built where the licensing and permits committee had said they could not be that we were not allowing a sidewalk cafe for that restaurant, so I think we should take that just use the number, but before anything else, I wanted to say Lucia.
Try to ask how about places that are restricted, like don't even think about it, which you know do you have already have those information?
So then we don't have to waste time trying to think that maybe City Hall Park can work.
They came to us transportation because they wanted to know the community boards input and it's going to be discussed tomorrow, an executive committee.
So, for example, you know Frances said the community board should be including the approval and an oversight and I think that you know you can either dig into what oversight looks like.
You know I think that people are open to maybe a little bit of leeway for their business neighbors and so like.
At the same time, most people are home, and so, even though I you know, I fully agree that somehow businesses have to open again a lot.
Is these fireworks, though we didn't, you know, come under any committee, but it's four thousand five illegal fireworks sales are up four thousand percent according to the governor and like in everywhere we're hearing them all the time.
If you have any other topics that you want to bring to quality of life, as they always say this, you know you are the committee members I mean you might want to put fireworks on for next month.
