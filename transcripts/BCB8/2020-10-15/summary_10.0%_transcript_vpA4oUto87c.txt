Oh hi, Miss Tiath, so the the tax lien sale is something that usually happens every year for properties that are either have property tax arrears or they have unpaid water bills or it could be because of unpaid charges or fines related to HPD violations or the Enforcement program, and people have talked about asking the city to continue to po, to postpone this tax lien sale, because there's a fear that it could lead to people losing their homes through foreclosure because of the crisis.
First, tax, lien sales for class 1 residential buildings 1 to 3 units on the current tls list, especially if owner occupied, should be suspended until the end of the Covid-19 related state of emergency.
We do understand that the city is going through a budget crisis receiving far less from the state and federal governments than needed, and the revenue brought in by property.
We want to copy the independent budget office and ask them to go over the numbers for the past few years and tell us if the city only adds to which shelter costs burden by forcing evictions through this tax, lien sale, process.
I. This is something that I do not know that this is going to be a separate issue, but we as a garden are trying to think about what to do about retrieving our land from someone who has been delinquent, Mr side, I'm, not sure that your headphones are working.
My knowledge case in point: we acquired a property on sterling place, bec, new communities and local non- profit, housing developer and the family complained to then a state assembly member clarence, Norman.
So an analogy directly here: If the state or the city were the owner of that middle lot, they could, at their discretion, give it back to the community, but with tax liens.
This idea of the city losing control of its own properties and being held by rich people who live outside the city, and this is this is a real problem that we need to address, and you know until we can figure that out we're just going to be kind of spinning.
So I can be one of those people where all taxes and a multitude of Things, and not because I do not want to pay, because my tenants are not paying and those are things I think need to be addressed because we are lumped into with all these multi multi- apartments landlords and we are not, and we I lived in this community as everybody knows.
So I want to hear what it is that you would like for the committee to work on during this coming.
And I feel like there's a lot of confusion everywhere about you know the state of the eviction moratorium.
You know the various different protections that are available to people and it just seems like every I tried to send it to the land, use and housing committees, just filling in some details about the state of the eviction moratorium and the very next day there was.
There's, a new development, and I do not know if it feels like part of what the community board is best able to do- Is, to communicate things and to answer people's questions.
You know, I mean everyone needs some remedies and we need clarity, so I think we kind of have an emergency meeting as soon as possible to get people sorted out on this thing.
And, one of the things that need to be addressed because they're saying oh moratorium are not paying around and people who can afford to pay their rent are not paying their rent, because I know people who work for transit people who walks to the city And they are not paying their rent, and Who are the people who I can see?
And if she would make sure that Ms Neil has that on maybe on a weekly basis, we could consider doing an email blast to update people on what the new status is for the various programs that the city and the state are offering and where they can go to get help.
If he's interested in doing something like that, if he would be interested, you may not have heard it, but I was suggesting that possibly a wider survey might make more sense to include other parts of central Brooklyn, not just community board eight, but I was saying I do not know.
But one of the things we want to ask and follow up on what has been James is going through, is to ask for carb out of from the eviction moratorium with those tenants who still have their jobs.
If the tenant can't show that they were financially impacted, so okay Well, if I may, if I may, have want to bring up another thing- Now, the Borah President's land, Use, director, Richard Barack, has brought it to my attention again that a lot of the folks who live in this community district are being ejected from the housing lotteries, because they're asking for affordable apartments and as we all know, affordability is described as you're, paying 30 of your income in rent.
I'm asking you all to support a letter to go to DCP and to the mayor to reduce the affordability marker to 25 of income, to get priority for a set aside for a community district when a zoning of zoning is done and the developer comes in and they get into zoning The affordability is described usually at 30 percent of income.
You did not know, I, actually work for the independent budget, office, If you ever want our housing person to come in and speak to the board.
But we have some people who are quite good on housing and can come in and talk to the board.
, there's association of neighborhood for neighborhood housing, development, They have courses, I, think they charge for most of those, and I am working with George to use the land use committee meetings for December and January for DCP to come in and do a piece on zoning without 20 minutes, they're still trying to gather information for the in- ground.
Last winter, I think it was, or the winter before, where the bro president of Manhattan actually had classes on everything that community board members deal with, And she did not say you could not come because you did not work in Manhattan or did not live.
