If, you did not hear him say something in the chat or by mutant talk to me at the end, Mr Witherwax, if I may, before you get started, I'm, getting a text message from a fellow colleague on the board who's saying that by calling in he's not allowed to engage with audio So, his roll call or his attendance vote would not be able to be heard, not good.
Thank you for allowing me to speak with the Community Board tonight, I'm here to talk about the interfaith medical center and our plans of around our pediatric inpatient, services.
All right in response to tonight's budget, request, keep in mind that starting in May and ending through the end and extending through the end of July, the district office sends mailings emails and surveys to residents requesting assistance in discovering what is needed in the community.
We are in the process of scheduling land use, training for community body, work, you'll be getting information over the next week for city planning to come in and do a webinar during our regular meeting.
I want to remind our attendees and our participants that these materials are available on the Towns City Council website, by community district and by category expense, budget and capital budget items for fiscal 22., also for fiscal 21, where we are now, and so please take a look at that.
We taking any proposals or funding requests from any non- profit organizations that can provide those services, because I know just by Broward Park This week there were two shootings You know the issue is: What are we going to do about this?
Keep in mind that starting in May and extending through the end of July, the district office sends mailings emails and surveys, residents requesting assistance and discovering what is needed in the community.
We submit our items to the community for review during this public hearing in this time of the year.
Therefore, our budget items are a compilation of what is submitted to the district office and what the office staff recognizes is needed in the community based on questions and complaints fielded throughout the course of the year.

We understand these different demographics need different things, and that is why we continue to reach out for your community input, but at this time, I'd like to make a motion that the full board vote on the final submission of the budget document and give the district office the authority to use this information gathered at tonight's hearing and by email submission to prioritize the top 40 capital expenses, our top 40 capital items in the top 25 expense.
The committee voted to support this application, as presented by a final vote of 12 in favor, zero opposed and zero abstentions, and hopes that the full board support its recommendation.
They, can acknowledge themselves in the chat or via other methods, seeing or hearing no other indications of a question or comment about this new application presented.
If you come acrosss any issues and operations, we ask that you know contact the Community Board office are trying to reach out and speak directly with the pr, the proprietors and the principals as they're all going through a learning experience and trying to be compliant with these rules and regulations that are being updated on a regular basis.
We have a new secretary for the land, Use Committee The the report for the October first meeting that was prepared in the office, and I will ask her to read that What's recorded there and then hear the motion that was made at the October 1st meeting Ms Daniel.
Oh basically, here is that on Thursday October 1st We had a presentation from a representative of the Hope Street Capital 959 Sterling Partnership, Tiffany Raspberry and her team regarding a proposed new building on the campus of the Hebron school at 920 park.
The building as presented, is institutional, looking and not becoming of the area and small apartments are not designed for long- term stay and growth in the community, but are designed for transients or Short- term Stays parishioners state that hope, Street Capital's presentation was misleading and confusing, as many Congress did not speak English and the presentation was entirely in English.
As presented a committee member offered an amendment to the motion for the committee not to support the application unless developers had a setback at the fourth floor and starting place on the sterling place side of the building to reduce the mass and scale and allow it to better match the shorter row houses and for the developer to commit to affordable, New York option.
The committee voted to withhold support for the applications presented with a vote, a final vote of 14 in favor to oppose the Dr abstentions and hopes the full board will support its recommendation to not support Hebron project as presented.
For over 15 years, local community members, including members of the Crown Heights North Association, have offered to meet with the church's leadership in order to share grant opportunities that would fund the restoration of this building.
We urge Community board 8 to vote against this project.
This greedy developer shows no regard for community concerns, is willing to desecrate a landmark building for his own profit, has no real intention of offering affordable housing and makes corrupt backdoor deals behind the backs of her bronze members.
Dr Daniel Honore, the president of the Northeast conference of seven day, adventist churches sent a statement dated October 7 yesterday to Community Board 8, addressing many of the issues that were raised in the previous statement.
This board meeting was chaired by pastor John Philippe, then pastor of the Hebron church, pastor, Philippe invited me to make a presentation to the church explaining the details of the proposal on Saturday October, 14, 2017.
These include 21.5 million dollars in cash to the Hebron church, a regulation size gymnasium for the Hebron school in the new building at Hope, Street's expense.
We seek the same rights as the yeshivas and catholic schools to educate our children according to our faith, and if anybody needs a copy of this letter, if you put in the chat your email, address, I can send it to you so that you can review it.
I just want to, I guess, address the Community board and especially members that may have not attended October.
Am a member of Hope Street capital, not the sda , so Is that the reputations themselves, that the crucial repairs necessary for the existing structure are well in excess of 10 million dollars, and we actually have a letter that I can send over to right now from the church stating that they intend to spend as much money as necessary to make the repairs And they're sure that the repairs are in absence of 10 million dollars, but it could obviously exceed that.
You all right, while we like, just in response to Ms Tyus's, request to wrap this up, I'd like to ask the board office to unmute when you want, and while I do that, I just want to do some clarifications- that the concern for the deletion of green space was not directly responded to by Leed certification.
I wanted to follow up to what fiore had spoken about earlier when she was speaking about affordable housing and friends of 920 park, for the record is a diverse intergenerational coalition of neighbors united in our firm opposition to hope, Street capitals, project at 9:20 park place to date.
Number one: The project goes against landmarks, law, the partial demolition of the historic structure, its inappropriate scale and style, the obscured sight, lines, the significant adverse impact on the old homes, visual entity and the character altering changes to the open space are all in direct violation of the city's environmental quality review.
This is cultural erasure and it begs the question: Whose monuments does the city protect, whose history matters the proposed project will be the first building of such magnitude, built in our historic district, since it was given landmark structure status by the LPC less than 10 years ago, and would set a dangerous precedent for preservation standards in this new historic district number.
I'm looking and the only final comments that I'm seeing that are speaking in response to the green space they wanted to community members wanted to acknowledge.
I want I'm asking now for comments from the community board members on this project.
There's really no opportunity to argue that in the scope of a certificate of appropriateness application, so the community board could potentially take a position against this project.
And, I'm speaking to the Community board, members now, if for no other reason than we've, given some guidance to the commissioners when they review this project that they at least will discuss in the meeting.
There was mention of a scope, but a scope is very tenuous, especially with historic properties that the cost could easily go way beyond What preliminary estimates and those of us who live in the community know that the top two floors have never been used by the school, and we wonder if in fact, they're, sincere and actually wanting to renovate the entire property, seeing that they're only using half of it would be a great tragedy if they only renovated part of the building and left the rest of it to decay.
Use Committee was insufficient to answer the needs of both the full board and the committee, and although I've heard Miss Rasberry expressed that she has no desire to do, so, I would say that she could take the temperature in the room and if she were to receive a no vote on behalf of her.
They we wanted to make sure that all of our concerns were heard, including the lack of affordable housing for this community.
Well before I make my motion, I also want to share with the full committee that Crown Heights North Association submitted a lengthy letter about his position, as did not friends of 9:20, which outlays numerous reasons why this project should be posed.
However, my motion, I, move that the committee withhold support for the new building proposed for the campus of Hebron school at 9:20 park.
And I have to ask you to please either put your statement in the chat and or send it by email to the board office with a copy to me.
So at this at this point we have foreclosed our opportunity to have any further engagement with the project sponsors on this level and would look at working with them as we move towards the October 20th LPC hearing.
As with many people in the community, they're, the first to be aware of news aside from our school's public safety, officers.
We will be meeting virtually on the 27th of October to sort of discuss a wrap up of the liverpool streets project going on in our district all summer, and we welcome those who want to discuss sanitation, environmental and transportation issues, some of which have been already percolated here tonight in the chat and elsewhere, and the budget discussions come out, join the committee I hope that will be on the agenda.
The next committee to report housing- Let you all know that we will be having our first virtual meeting this coming, Wednesday October 14th, and we will start at six o'clock.
I, look forward to working with everyone and I understand that we have a group that will be coming that is concerned about security in buildings within New York City.
Everyone I want to make sure that everyone knows that early voting is going to be taking place.
It will provide 436 billion in much needed support for state and local governments, as you know that we're having an issue with a deficit with the city, and we want to make sure that everyone is funded, but that would have to mean that the Senate would have to vote on it, but it has been passed by the house.
If anyone has any questions, concern issue, you can either email And I'll, put that information in the chat and again the censors, get out and want to vote to encourage someone.
We want to start that at our next land Use committee meeting, which is always the first Thursday.
So we will be also asking city planning to do a presentation on zoning, about 20 minutes and they're prepared to answer questions from you as community board.
It does not have to be a land use committee meeting we can set another date now work with Ms George to identify a date they're willing to do that.
If you have questions about zoning as it relates to our district in particular, M crown, please submit them to me and the Community Board office.
The land use director for the Brooklyn borough president is willing to do a follow- up webinar on euler, so that when we meet as a committee, we understand what those processes and constructs are, and we can ask the correct questions.
Hpd's announcement asks for community participation regarding the development of new, affordable housing and neighborhood amenities and prospect.
