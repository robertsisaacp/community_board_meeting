I'm, the chair of the community board, 8 liquor license and Sidewalk Cafe Review Committee as we're just starting to prepare and other people are joining us.
All right, we're still waiting on one other committee member to meet quorum, but I will go ahead and check in with some of our other guests to see who we have here.
Some of these great restaurants and licensed establishments that we have all right, I apologize again for the delay still waiting to meet a quorum.
I can only suggest that the committee has the discussions on the three applicants right now for expediency and time purposes, and then the full board would just have to ratify the discussions on Thursday.
All right, okay, as suggested by our district office, We'll go ahead and move forward with our items and agenda matters, As mentioned before.
And I'm, acknowledging Mr Weatherspoon, who is one of our vice chairs, Helping support with meeting minutes and voting counts as well as being verified by Ms Julia Neil of the Community Board eight District office.
And we've also identified Miss Bun street from 689 Washington Avenue at Muse, I'll, first ask to unmute Miss Deborah Williamson from James, as me will review her application.
All right, so Miss Williams here presenting a renewal application for James Restaurant Corp Group LLC at 605 Carlton been in business operating as James for 12 years as a restaurant bar application presents indoor seating area of 10 tables with 30 seats.
Permitted outdoor spacing is not included on this application, but an amendment is made stating that, due to Covid-19 restrictions and allowances that they have activated outdoor patios and slightly temporary shorter hours of operations, There are six residences in the building, 10 residences, left right and rear, and eight service employees, no live, Entertainment.
The applicant has presented reads that Mr Max Colson is presenting a renewal from Brooklyn parliament LLC doing business as catfish at 1433, Bedford Avenue in business since January of 2013 as a restaurant bar 15 tables with 32 seats, one bar with 11 seats, maximum indoor capacity at 74 hours of operation proposed 11 A.M to 2 a.m. Seven days.
That's 15 by 15 seats, three tables with 16 to 20 patrons maximum outdoor capacity is 20 with noise, with hours of operation until 9 pm nightly and moving along sound system behind the bar, with six speakers of below 50 watts, per speaker, 31 service employees, with a manager on duty at all hours and closed caption, TV, security, 15 residents left right and rear, and existing operational chips include Covid-19 operations, restrictions and allowances.
Okay, all right so looking at the application, it might be better.
So Ms Bunsfree is here representing good luck, 689, doing business as muse at 689 Washington Avenue at the corner of prospect place in operation for four years as a restaurant bar with the liquor wine beer insider license currently programmed with 11 tables, with 22 seats, 74 indoor capacity, the hours of operation with slight changes.
The building two one is the applicant and then other residents include one left right and rear, and this is to allow for outdoor seating permit permitted during the pandemic.
I. Think this to the committee that this is a renew an application for alteration for the license to include this sidewalk cafe: space.
Yes, so you know, I'm, not sure I mean open restaurants kind of throws everything into a slightly different perspective, but this is an application for a sidewalk cafe with I.
It's fine to obviously have the background music inside the restaurant, but I don't know of any applications where we've allowed it outside.
Somebody else wants to message her and help coach her through that I have a kind of a different tact that I'd, maybe look at suggesting I mean currently the city's guidelines and opportunities are allow for all types of setups and activities and with that it's within the jurisdictions of the SLA operations, to also allow for that.
I. Think it's hard to understand the current circumstances of memorializing, as Mr Verconi pointed out, 24 seats, which is an excess of their interior capacity, as well as potentially memorializing amplified outdoor music, which certainly would be helpful to some businesses, but might also cause conflict for communities and neighbor community members and neighbors.
If there's a reason, Why she's doing this now, because I think the things that she's showing in her application are things that would be allowed under the open restaurants.
I. You, know from our experience on Vanderbilt Avenue, I'm, not positive, I'm, convinced that restaurants need amplified music outdoors.
I think we should go with open restaurants, which is really flexible and let lets operators you know, take advantage of the sidewalk without going through the community board for a permit, in fact, I think even way.
I mean I, think it's the police would be the people who would be enforcing it right now, as Wayne pointed out.
If I might I think the question here is whether this application, if she really needs an application for a sidewalk, cafe to do this now, because I think it looks like she can do this all with through the open restaurant program, And I share, similar sentiments, I.
I think she might join us, but I share similar sentiments in this, because with the city's regulations and the allowances by the state SLA to allow for these this interstitial period to be serviced with by the special regulations of open, streets, restaurants, It might be in the better interest for the applicant to can you continue moving forward as they are and then when they want to memorialize the permanence make the alteration as necessary.
The motion was to table this item until we have a better communication with the applicant to understand the intention of her sidewalk cafe alteration with also understanding that the current city, program, open streets could potentially service her request at this time without having to make a formal, application.
Yes, I would like to make a motion that any time that there is a conflict of what the community board would normally do and what open streets allows them to do.
