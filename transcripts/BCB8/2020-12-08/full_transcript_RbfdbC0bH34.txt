Oh hello, hi, hello- this is from the 77 here for the SLA meeting. Hi hello is this for the SLA meeting, I, think so infections. Now, compared to a week ago, 14 states holding steady, somewhat deceptive, holding steady at very high levels that six states trending down again. That could be somewhat deceptive, too trending down from very high points, but this is where we look today. If you look at it one month ago, the map looks a lot worse right good evening, everyone. This is Julia with Community board eight. The meeting will be starting in a few minutes. I. Thank you for your patience and I apologize for my news. In the background, as I tried to figure out which tab had the news open hello. Did you hear me? Yes, we can hear you none. Okay! Thank you. Thank I'm doing well! Thank you. How are you today Miss Williamson? You need okay, how's, that okay, now I can hear you, okay, great hi and anonymous. Is that catfish, okay, foreign bye? Okay, thank you! Miss Ellis I just want to update the you that catfish did send their materials. It's now in the dropbox link, were you able to? Can you send over our voting roster that we can use? Are you able to do that from your seat? Give me one. Second, let me see if I have it on this computer I hope I can check the email. Give me one. Second, it's going to be the same. One I said in September: I, don't think anyone dropped off via committee. If you need me to I, can do the role for you for the three votes. It's not a problem. Okay, I had Miss Weatherspin was willing to do so. I just wanted to give her the tools, not a problem. Just give me two minutes to find the voting the most up to the most recent voting roster for slack and I'll. Send it out to both of you too. Just give me two minutes good evening. My name is James Ellis, I'm the chair of the community board, 8 liquor license and Sidewalk Cafe Review Committee as we're just starting to prepare and other people are joining us just need to clear up some recording information. We have one. Member of this call who's identified as Anonymous. Can you unmute and let us know who you are or change your sign on tag on the screen. James 201 numbers is me: you're up, Mr Picca I see you're labeled, there's just one there's one camera, that's labeled anonymous being this is an open meetings, they're subject to open meetings. Laws want to just make sure we're identifying who's all here, asking one more time if the anonymous person can identify themselves. Okay, I'm hoping someone just changed their name or they left all right. Well, let's I appreciate everyone's patience, as we still continue to wait to get committee members. Mr Ellis I just sent the voting roster to both you and Ms Westbound. Thank you so much I received it we're just waiting on a few others of our committee to join to reach a quorum. So I appreciate your patience and FYI. The voting roster has been updated. You've lost three members since September, sir. Are we still at 19? As our committee number, you are at oh I, just closed it whoopsies and you are at 16 members now. Oh, so I don't have a new one: oh no I just sent it I just sent it about two minutes ago. Gotcha. So Quorum equals nine. Okay Julia. Can you update or apprise us of in the situation of unidentified people in the meeting I wish I could I? Actually it comes up in the participant list. Also, as anonymous are we beholden to allow people to maintain in the room if they won't identify themselves? I, don't know that we have the ability to kick them out in meetings versus events. I have to look at terms and conditions of Webex. Give me a moment, I'm only asking, because it's just in a better public interest for transparency to know who all the participants are totally understandable, I get it I would think it would be very similar to a person coming to an in-person meeting and not signing the sign-in sheet, but I don't know state new guidelines. Give me one second, just let me check terms and conditions of Webex and compare it to the open meetings mandate. All right we're still waiting on one other committee member to meet quorum, but I will go ahead and check in with some of our other guests to see who we have here today, I recognize Miss Bunstree from muse great to see you now and Miss William. Is it Miss Williamson? Are you a neighbor or part of an applicant? You can mute yourself, please hi yeah, I'm with James. Oh great, sorry, it's okay, I, don't know how I keep getting muted the district office puts everybody on auto mute it just you have to unmute. Okay, sorry, I didn't recognize you Deborah from the small screen format. It's okay, sorry, hi! Devon! Hey! How are you great? Thank you. Are you a member of our community or with one of our applicants, I'm with catfish? Oh wonderful, all right! Great thanks, Devin I see Mr Baracovoli hello. This is officer Vidal representing service Center in precinct. Oh wonderful, thank you for joining us officer. We appreciate your presence all right and we'll check back with you in just a second on any applicants: Mr Pally Joseph Pally. If you'd like to unmute yourself, can you hear me yes, Sir, sorry about that yeah, I'm just I'm here potential future applicant, just wanting to observe, if that's okay, absolutely you're welcome. Thank you for doing so. We appreciate your due diligence. Absolutely thank you, and you can also refer to the information available on the community board 8 website for applicants both new and renewal. There should be a list of items as a checklist to help you get started in your process. Excellent. Thank you. Awesome all right, we're still waiting for a quorum but I guess in the meantime, just as a reminder as we head into the holiday season, and this committee's oversight typically refers to restaurants and bars and eating and drinking establishments within our neighborhood I would encourage our members, as well as other community participants, to consider gift certificates and restaurant credits as potential gift ideas from your neighborhood to help kind of keep and support our neighborhood businesses, as they make it through this tough winter period. Share. That idea out certainly subscribe to it. If you can, and it makes sense for you and try to help showcase. Some of these great restaurants and licensed establishments that we have all right, I apologize again for the delay still waiting to meet a quorum. So we can manage any actionable items tonight. Once we hit quorum, we should be able to move through our items pretty quickly. James is Wait is Wayne, I'm going to try to text Wayne. Is he on this eight hmm Mr Ellis? It appears that the committee on open government states that people can participate anonymously and in webcast meetings so long as they are not official counts for quorum and also so long as they don't interrupt the meeting it's akin to just sitting, silently in the back of a meeting an open meeting, in-person meeting all right. Well, thank you so much for that clarification. I appreciate knowing that nuance to this virtual world of conducting business, not a fraud, still waiting one more one, two, three, four: five, six, seven eight we need nine I can only suggest that the committee has the discussions on the three applicants right now for expediency and time purposes, and then the full board would just have to ratify the discussions on Thursday. All right, okay, as suggested by our district office, we'll go ahead and move forward with our items and agenda matters, as mentioned before. My name is James Ellis, I'm the chair of the community board, eight SLA and Sidewalk Cafe Review Committee, I'm supported this evening and I'm acknowledging Mr Weatherspoon, who is one of our vice chairs, helping support with meeting minutes and voting counts as well as being verified by Ms Julia Neil of the Community Board eight District office. We have a few items, two of which are renewals in earlier introductions. We acknowledge Miss Devil from James of 605 Carlton, he acknowledged Devon, Bedford and sorry. We have additional voices all right and we've also identified Miss Bun street from 689 Washington Avenue at Muse. So let us get started with our renewals. I'll first ask to unmute Miss Deborah Williamson from James, as me will review her application. Now. Let me just pull up my reference. All right so Miss Williams here presenting a renewal application for James Restaurant Corp Group LLC at 605 Carlton been in business operating as James for 12 years as a restaurant bar application presents indoor seating area of 10 tables with 30 seats. One bar area with 10 seats for a total indoor capacity of 40. hours of operation is presented, is Sunday, 11 A.M to 11 P.M, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, 5:30 p.m, to midnight and Saturday 11 A.M to midnight. It doesn't appear to be any changes in hours requested with this application and they have installed noise. Attenuation measures permitted outdoor spacing is not included on this application, but an amendment is made stating that, due to Covid-19 restrictions and allowances that they have activated outdoor patios and slightly temporary shorter hours of operations, there are six residences in the building, 10 residences left right and rear, and eight service employees no live. Entertainment. Sound system includes a two speakers of low wattage and that concludes the presented application. Miss Williamson. Is there anything that you'd like to add to your renewal application? No, not really I mean you know. Yeah I mean it is different because we're you know in the middle of it. So all right, but yeah, no everything, that's accurate. Our hours are shorter right. Now, we're actually only six days instead of seven, but hopefully, when everything you know comes back to life, we'll be seven days again so and we certainly hope so yeah. Okay, are there any questions or comments about this renewal application from any committee members or community members I make a motion that we accept the renewal okay I feel like we might have to award it differently, since we don't have quorum. That we could just make a motion just to suggest to the full board to support. Is that maybe a better, more accurate, perfect, okay, James do a head count, one more time, I think we may have reached the number five. There are only 14 participants on the call yep we're still at number eight. We still need a ninth okay. Well, I is there a second to I mean? Is there a support for Wayne's suggestion I'll? Second, it this is years of Weatherspoon Hi Irisa. Thank you Julia is it suggested? Do we still need to do a roll call voila, or can we just do a you can do a shorter site vote? You don't have to do a roll call. If anyone disagrees they can just voice their opinion. Now, if there are any proposed stipulations, they can do that now as well. This is a discussion, so it's not official record, so you don't have to go the official route. Thank you for that clarity. Ms Neil. Are there any objections to Mr Bailey's suggestion? Are there any comments or amendments to Mr Bailey's suggestion I'm hearing or none of these, and it would be upon me to suggest Mr Bailey's suggestion be moved forward to the full board. All right? Well, thanks, miss Williamson, I hope everything goes well for you for the season. As mentioned, we will be presenting this to the full board due to a lack of quorum, that our conversation and suggestions are such as that and the full board would take up the opportunity to move this forward in an official capacity. Okay, the meeting is I believe next is this Thursday and we appreciate your attendance in case there's any outstanding questions from any major any members at large from the border community as to this application. Great okay, thank you so much. Thank you and good luck. Thank you all right. Moving to our next renewal application is catfish at 1433, Bedford Avenue. We receive materials late today in the dropbox, for so those of our committee members that have not taken a look at that they are now available there. So I am pulling that up and Devin is here. Devin just remind us. Your last name aired by ers a white rs, okay, great so Mr Ayers is here representing catfish. The applicant has presented reads that Mr Max Colson is presenting a renewal from Brooklyn parliament LLC doing business as catfish at 1433, Bedford Avenue in business since January of 2013 as a restaurant bar 15 tables with 32 seats, one bar with 11 seats, maximum indoor capacity at 74 hours of operation proposed 11 A.M to 2 a.m. Seven days a week, noise attenuation measures were extensive. You can. We can refer back to 2016 reference documents. Oh I'd like to take a pause now because it looks like we might have hit quorum, so we might move over to official business one two, three, four: five: six, seven, eight nine officially we're at Quorum, so Miss Weatherspoon. Can we just take a roll call sure move these items into actual sure good evening. Everyone Hermione Allison, mute yourself, sir present thank you. Wayne Bailey President Gail Branch, Muhammad, James, Ellis, President, Janet, Collins, Oliver, Hart, Present, Roger, Myers, Robert, Puka, Brian, Saunders, Meredith, Staton, Mark Thurton. Here myself, here's a weather, spoon Robert with a wax Deborah young nine people, as confirmed. Thank you, miss Weatherspoon and sorry for that interruption. I just wanted to move this into official business, so thank you. Mr bears for your patience there. As mentioned before, as we were moving through this document, the applicant is proposing 11, as is presenting 11 a.m to 2 a.m. As their hours of operation with extensive noise attenuation measures, a outdoor service area includes a patio or deck. That's 15 by 15 seats, three tables with 16 to 20 patrons maximum outdoor capacity is 20 with noise, with hours of operation until 9 pm nightly and moving along sound system behind the bar, with six speakers of below 50 watts per speaker, 31 service employees, with a manager on duty at all hours and closed caption, TV security, 15 residents left right and rear, and existing operational chips include Covid-19 operations, restrictions and allowances. Mr Colson's application is also accompanied by a letter and I'll be happy to read that in for the record, it says fine, please find our renewal application attached. We are complying with all Covid-19 city state requirements and most of these requirements have been and will continue to be subject to change. The information provided in this application is consistent with our pre-pandemic operations. Like many restaurants, we've closed temporarily in March, we decided to reopen in October and are currently utilizing our existing patio space. In addition to the 25 allowed use of indoor occupancy that we're using exclusively to accommodate indoor dining as Presidio state rules, we have not applied for any sidewalk seating. We have concluded such additional seating measures would be difficult for us to diligently manage. We have had not. We have not had any complaints, nor do we have pending issues with our neighbors. At the moment we are focused on doing our best to survive without compromising the welfare and safety of our staff and patrons. We look forward to a future that is more predictable and that our shared reality and that we thank you for consideration and support through these times. Thank you for that additional letter. Are there any questions or comments for Devon and his team at catfish on the renewal of their application, see no indications of questions or comments. I see that Miss Muhammad has joined us. Thank you. Okay. Is anyone willing to make a motion to make a motion that we support the renewal application? Second excellent Mr Bailey has made a motion Mr Cacone, a second in said motion. Are there any comments or questions on the motion hearing or seeing no indicators of any questions? I'll ask Miss Weatherspoon to call the vote: okay, Kim, Kar Minnie? Ah, I'm sorry, Kermany Allison!

I'm sorry, okay, no problem all right, so we have one two, three, four: five: six: seven, eight nine in favor and one abstain of this application of catfish moving forward. Wonderful, thank you! Miss weatherstone and thank you to the committee Mr Ayers. We, as mentioned before the previous applicant, will be presenting this to the full board on Thursday evening. Details to log in can be obtained from the district office, but some representative president would be appreciated in case there's any outstanding questions from the larger body. Okay, thank you. Mr Ayers all right. There were a couple of new applications on the agenda that was circulated. However, no participant has joined us nor any paperwork received. So we will move on to the section c of our agenda, which is for alterations and 689 Washington Avenue with Mu's Thai restaurant Mrs Bunstri. How are you today? Can you please unmute yourself? Let me know yes ma'am great all right, so just for clarity, I'm checking the only reason you're here is to change your application to include a sidewalk cafe. Yes, I can close the sidewalk cafe for the future, and now are you filing with the city DCA to legalize the sidewalk cafe? Yes, we do. Okay, all right so looking at the application, it might be better I. Might I'm trying to share my screens, so we can do this in real time, one second to get it up on screen. All right is Miss Bunstree's application visible to the remainder of the group. All right can someone anyone else acknowledge. If you can see the application, I can see the application all right great. So this is an application for a alteration to an existing license. So Ms Bunsfree is here representing good luck, 689 doing business as muse at 689 Washington Avenue at the corner of prospect place in operation for four years as a restaurant bar with the liquor wine beer insider license currently programmed with 11 tables, with 22 seats, 74 indoor capacity, the hours of operation with slight changes. It includes 10 a.m, to 12:30 on Sunday, 1, P.M to 12:30, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, 10 A.M to 12:30, Friday and Saturday, and then, which is a slight change from their original operations. Here you can see they were opening later in the day and closing a little later on. The weekends noise includes background music. This outdoor seating area that they're proposing is described here on the sidewalk cafe on the prospect place front of 29.6 feet by 7.9 feet on Washington and 25.8, and six feet on prospect with six tables to see 24 patrons their proposed hours requested until 11:30 p.m nightly and, let's see, I think if I scroll down further, you guys can see oh yeah some staff and security with five employees. The building two one is the applicant and then other residents include one left right and rear, and this is to allow for outdoor seating permit permitted during the pandemic. Edition of the sidewalk cafe so I think I can alright so trying to fit this into the screen. This is what it appears to be presented here. So what Miss man? Will you just remind us? What sides what's going on here on this is the this side. Here is the Washington Avenue side, the Washington side, what you're, proposing as part of your application, I guess, help us understand what we're looking at this is the Washington Avenue side. So you look like to enclose two table. Is that two seats all right? So this is a table here and then this? What part is the enclosed area this over here in there man? Can you tell us, it's part, explain what part is enclosed. All right, maybe there's difficulties all right. Mr Ellis I was just around there. Yesterday. The Washington Avenue side has six tables three single seats, three single cedar tables with two seats. Each and the prospect place side is enclosed in the removable plexiglas tent. Okay, all right well does any of our committee members have any questions about this application. I guess I can go that route. Okay. Are there any community members here with any questions, any neighbors, all right? Well, no yeah! So just a reminder. I think this to the committee that this is a renew an application for alteration for the license to include this sidewalk cafe space. If anybody has any questions or would be willing to move this or dispose of this, I'm open to hearing hi James, this is Kim. Can you hear me? Yes, sir? So I'm assuming this is a this is not open. Restaurants. This is a application for a permanent sidewalk cafe right. That is my understanding. Yes, so you know, I'm not sure I mean open restaurants kind of throws everything into a slightly different perspective, but this is an application for a sidewalk cafe with I. Think a larger number of seats than we had in the restaurant is that right, yes, I mean that so in normal times, that probably would not be something we would look for. We look. We generally look for, like around a 50 ratio, I, I'm unsure how to handle that question here. Whether you know on a permanent basis, I mean if we're proving this on a permanent basis. I think what we would kind of be saying is. We might have a lot of restaurants that are looking to permanently enlarge the size of their sidewalk cafes. That might be an okay thing. We might be fine with that right now or we might not be, but that does seem to at least warrant some kind of a discussion. The second question that I have on this is: there's a discussion about piping music to this outdoor cafe, but I. Don't believe that that's something that we typically allow. So I would like to ask the applicant if they are willing to remove that from the application. It's fine to obviously have the background music inside the restaurant, but I don't know of any applications where we've allowed it outside. Well, especially nothing memorialized outside of pandemic or Covid-19 Restrictions Ms Palm Street. Did you hear Mr Vakoni's comment, so Nan he's Mr Viconia is suggesting that to move forward on this that the removing of any outdoor speakers would be contingent. So no speakers outside she's having technical, audio issues. Don't you have her call in James? Yes, it's yourself Deborah Young has something to say: can we use this moment to say have her say something while you sure I just sent a message to miss Bun street that asked if she might want to call in for a better connection, so miss young. Please go ahead. Okay, yeah! This is in line with what I get just mentioned, and I'm I'd like us to take into account what's going on, and certainly I'm not suggesting that we have any loud outdoor amplified music, but given that we may find ourselves having this request come before us in other instances, maybe we could put some structure around allowing soft low-volume music, because these businesses are hurting and if this might be something that would allow them to have more customers. I'd like to see if we can explore be creative, with some semblance of consideration for some mild soft music outside for a limited period of time. Thank you. Miss young I certainly understand what you're presenting and if I may I have a different tact. I'm thinking yeah, Nan I. Think it's better. If you call can you hang up and call so, she just needs to call all right, I texted her. Somebody else wants to message her and help coach her through that I have a kind of a different tact that I'd, maybe look at suggesting I mean currently the city's guidelines and opportunities are allow for all types of setups and activities and with that it's within the jurisdictions of the SLA operations, to also allow for that. Due to these Covid-19 times, where the special permitting that Miss, Bunsari I believe is looking for to memorialize her outdoor cafe, it's not necessary at this time. So my thoughts are that we can. They can continue to operate with under the guidance and guidelines of what New, York, City and New York state has allowed for without needing to make a formal alteration to their application and then in the due and appropriate time in the future when things such as this might want to be memorialized more permanently moving forward. The suggestion, then, would be to make income towards come for an alteration against her application. I think it's hard to understand the current circumstances of memorializing, as Mr Verconi pointed out 24 seats, which is an excess of their interior capacity, as well as potentially memorializing amplified outdoor music, which certainly would be helpful to some businesses, but might also cause conflict for communities and neighbor community members and neighbors. So memorializing such of those activities might be something that might it might be a little too much at this point, but that's my offering to this discussion at this point we're waiting to see if this bunserie can dial in to mixed responses. I see Gibb has a response. Yeah I just wanted to say: I am supportive of those comments. I think that, given right now, I think it's very it's a little strange making approving sidewalk cafes right now, since the city's created all sorts of latitude for sidewalk, cafes and I think it would be better to have operators take advantage of that right now, rather than looking to amend their licenses, and we get back to that once you know the pandemic is over I mean as long as the city is continuing to allow flexibility for restaurants to serve outdoors under open restaurants. I think they should have ended and not go through this process now. I would I'd be curious to know from Ms Bunserie's point of view, if there's a reason, why she's doing this now, because I think the things that she's showing in her application are things that would be allowed under the open restaurants program. I'll also say that I, I'm not sure I mean I. You know from our experience on Vanderbilt Avenue, I'm not positive. I'm convinced that restaurants need amplified music outdoors. We generally didn't have it for the restaurants on Vanderbilt who didn't suffer for the lack of it. Some of them, you know, are playing music with open windows and people are listening outside and that that's okay, that's allowed anyway, so I I'd also be I'd, be reticent to document approving, amplified music for a sidewalk, cafe, I, don't without taking stock of the bigger situation, but mostly I just agree with James I think we should go with open restaurants, which is really flexible and let lets operators you know, take advantage of the sidewalk without going through the community board for a permit, in fact, I think even way. Back at the beginning of the lockdown, this committee voted to this committee voted to automatically approve sidewalk cafes in order to be in sympathy with the business conditions before the city did open restaurants. That is correct. We did talk about that early on and we did mention a resolution that would, during this period, wave our review process for outdoor spaces. Miss Bunstree. Are you able to hear us? Well, he has sent two messages that she's not able to hear. Okay. Do we have a phone number for? Can we call her and tell her to dial in I'm trying I? Don't have a number, maybe it's on her application right, I've texted her the login stuff and she isn't responding hi Ms Collins good evening. Please excuse my tardiness. I had a little bit of an emergency here, no problem thanks for joining James, while we're waiting I want to make one comment that the police are very reticent on doing anything about it enforcing much in the way of noise, complaints and the rest of it. So once we get into a situation where somebody's got noise complaints, it's really going to be tough to have the police enforce it or to do anything about it. Thank you. Yeah I can, second that, based on our experience on Vanderbilt Avenue, because I think I've sent that article around again, where the mayor has told the police that they are not to be bothering with noise complaints. Very much that's been in the New York Post and I can send it out again. Well, we do have Mr Butter cavoli from the 77th. If he would like to address any updates on how noise complaints are being handled from the 77th precinct hello. This is we presented this 77 precinct. Yes, as far as noise complaints for 689 Washington Avenue I was reviewing the three-on-one jobs. We have not any noise complaints for that location in this past year. Great thank you are there? Is there any additional supporting information that you're willing to share with our committee about how noise complaints are being handled from the 77th precinct? Well, they all addressed any 311 Corp. There is a sector, that's since response to each and every three-on-one call that's in regards to noise, so the officers are responding. Thank you for that. You're welcome. James. The question is just because they respond so did the seven eight they didn't do anything they I mean literally they're, not enforcing it. Go ahead. I see a hand raised by Mr Thurton to comment on continue, commenting on Deborah's Young's statement about the light music is. Are we accepting that or is that acceptable by this by the city now for the outdoor areas? Well, I think Wayne's, right, I, think what he's just explained is that by Fiat it is now acceptable during the lockdown and I can say from our experience. He's right, that is in practice, how it's working and I don't know if it's the best way for it to work or not, but it is what's happening and I think I, don't so I, don't think we have a need right now to authorize it as the community board and I request. We don't because, once the genie is out of the bottle from our perspective, it might be hard to put it back in again. I think that I think we need to just have the city treat the lockdown like the lockdown and not start to legislate it from the perspective of the community board, but is the city? Are they okay with it, I mean, although they're saying not police not to act on it? Are they accepting it? Is it acceptable? Well, the question: is it acceptable to who I mean I, think it's the police would be the people who would be enforcing it right now, as Wayne pointed out and I can confirm we're not enforcing it. Okay, so it's not even enforcing it. On right, okay, I have my hand up. Hi sorry miss young, I'm trying to get a yes go ahead. Please problem no problem. If that's the case and I accept the feedback, is this something that we would be then voting on? Would that be a part of the vote that she not have outdoor music or are we going to just leave it to this remain silent on it, I mean how would we be handling that, if that's the case, given this discussion about what's being allowed by the city? Well, if I might I think the question here is whether this application, if she really needs an application for a sidewalk, cafe to do this now, because I think it looks like she can do this all with through the open restaurant program. Okay and I share similar sentiments, I think it's. Oh look: I think she might join us, but I share similar sentiments in this, because with the city's regulations and the allowances by the state SLA to allow for these this interstitial period to be serviced with by the special regulations of open streets, restaurants, it might be in the better interest for the applicant to can you continue moving forward as they are and then when they want to memorialize the permanence make the alteration as necessary, yeah and just to expand for a minute. The there are a whole there's a whole set of guidelines around open restaurants that DOT enforces that are completely outside the scope of the community board and they're outside the scope of the DCA as well. You know the kinds of structures that you build, the house, the tables and the heating and all of that lives I think that lives with Dod right now. So we can't really. We don't really pass on any of that yeah Miss Bunstree. Are you able to hear us now I see that you've dialed in by phone- and it looks like that? Tom is also here, which might be your other establishment. You can unmute yourself on one of those items. Oh we lost the phone. Well, my hesitance right now is without being able to effectively communicate with the applicants. It makes us difficult to confirm with them their preference in moving this through has kind of been presented. If we were to move this alteration request through, it would require a more significant debate around some of the details, that's being presented, especially with amplified music and potentially even the structure itself, as an enclosed sidewalk, cafe, I think what Mr Mccartney has mentioned, and what I was kind of sharing was that under the current climate that there's not a need for that to happen at this point, Miss bunstri, are you available the world of virtual meetings? I think she's logged on from another source, but any success yet miss man well an effort to try to really just kind of move. This and Miss sponsoring can't communicate with us at this time. Maybe it's in the best interest of this application and our committee's efforts to table this to the next meeting, so we can confirm the applicant's desires and opportunities and options and so as to not make any decisions that might have long-term impacts that are unnecessary. Does anyone else want to can share that or feel similarly or have any other alternative options as to dispose of this right now, I I'll put it in the form of the emotion that we table this application until we're able to clarify the intentions of the applicant and with the understanding that it looks like it's possible for her to accomplish what she wants through the open restaurants program. Thank you, Mr Viconi. Is anyone willing to support that motion? Second I support. The motion. Mr Bailey has made a second to Mr Peconi's motion to table this item until the time we can speak with and understand the applicant's intentions. If there's no questions on this motion, please let me know if there are and if not then I'll have this Weatherspoon take a vote on tabling this item. Okay, so we are starting the voting Kimani Allison, yes, Wayne Bailey, yes, help Rancho vomit yeah, Exalus Danny, yes, Oliver Hart, yes, Robert Puka, yes, Roger, Myers, Ryan Saunders, yes, Meredith, Staton, Mark, Thurman, Third, Mark, 13, Mark, I, didn't hear you, okay, we have 12 in support cabling this application until we have some clear communication of the intentions of the applicant- and this is for muse- and this is from you- did everyone hear that District office meet everybody and we can start fresh all right? So that's Collins. The motion was to table this item until we have a better communication with the applicant to understand the intention of her sidewalk cafe alteration with also understanding that the current city program, open streets could potentially service her request at this time without having to make a formal application. Yes, I heard that I just didn't hear the name I think of the wrestler. It was from muse, Music, 89 Washington right a happy access. Thank you. You're welcome, James I just wanted to make a correction of some of my apologies beforehand for catfish I had said that it was nine. Yes, one abstain. Abstentions! Excuse me, but I forgot to include Oliver Hart's vote, so instead of nine. Yes, it's 10. Yes, one abstention. My apologies! Thank you for that clarity. Okay! Well, that I believe is all of our business. That was on our agenda that we received paper for work for I, want to acknowledge and thank everybody for joining us. I'll be a little late start. The first item was moved in an unofficial capacity to the board to make the recommendation that other items were done in committee business. I've said it before I'll say it again for some newcomers try to seize this opportunity, this holiday season for gifts and potentially tapping into some of our neighborhood's favorite restaurants, and using that as items to help support these businesses. During this rough time, Mr Bailey I saw that you had a hand. Did you have a final comment? Yes, I would like to make a motion that any time that there is a conflict of what the community board would normally do and what open streets allows them to do that. We do not act upon that in some precious manner. That causes us a problem later on down the line. I appreciate the spirit of that motion. Mr Bailey, I'm wondering if the previous resolution that we made out of this committee, waiving our committee's rights during Covid-19 for sidewalk review space would carry that particular spirit of what you're suggesting just FYI all applicants that apply for sidewalk, cafe or legalization of Outspace. As soon as I get there notice that they do intend to do exactly that. I. Let them know that it's been waived and they do not have to appear before us for those purposes. Doran Covid-19 and advise that they come back and Covid-19 is over. A lot of them would prefer to just get it done now, so that by the time Covid-19 ends they'll be set and ready to go with all of their legalization with SLA and DCA, okay, Mr Bailey. Does that satisfy the spirit of your motion? Do you want us to move through? Okay? Thank you. Mister! I'm good! No I just wanted us to be clear about not having to rehash this with people over and over again about what we want and our desires that the community's desire is and what needs to be done for the businesses to survive. Thank you all right and in efforts to close out I want to just offer any opportunity for any of our committee members for any questions or old business or new business. Otherwise, I will entertain a motion to adjourn motion thanks Ms Weatherspoon, Thanks Mr Bailey. Thank you all for participating tonight. Thank you to our applicants that are still here and we'll see you all on Thursday. Bye, thanks, Julia have a good night. Everyone good evening, good night. Everyone.
