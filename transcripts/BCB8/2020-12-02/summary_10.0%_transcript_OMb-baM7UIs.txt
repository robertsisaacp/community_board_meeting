Obviously, it's epidemic is going on and a lot of kids are doing remote learning, but we know that there's been an issue with internet access, particularly within NYCHA, developments, and so chair tires.
That's happened recently and, as we know, as we've all seen, The mayor announced that elementary school kids will be going to going back to in-person learning on December 7th, but I wanted to find out.
I was thinking that maybe we could attend some of our local cc meetings and see what they're talking about and see what it seems like the students within the confines of community board.
I'm thinking a lot of the students, a lot of the students that a lot of students that don't have the computers or not able to access the classroom platform I had suggested on one of the local meetings that you just mentioned, that what happened to sending home the homework packets that they used to send home over the summer.
I was just gonna say that I mean I, have a child that goes to new bridges and for like the last three days that they were in school.
He was carrying home every single book, all of his packets and like kind of just waiting until they officially closed the school.
You know: teachers at the school waiting to hand out devices to people who didn't have devices at home, so, like I know he does have paper packets and things like that.
One thing that I heard at the Cec meeting for 17 was that you know parents, even if they don't feel safe with their kids going into the school.
We still do warm coat exchanges, and things like that, so the community does want to still have the schools, as an access point, for you.
I do like that they're saying they're going to be doing more Covid-19 testing in the school, because that was always the argument you know in the city itself was above three percent for infection rates, so they made the decision to close the schools, but infection rates within the schools themselves were very low.
In comparison, And, so I think the idea that you know they're going to bring the kids back next week and just test more often in the schools, The teachers and the students should hopefully add some level of comfort to families.
Right I mean if anything the numbers going up across the city mean that they probably don't want their kids in school.
And like if you're, a working parent and you need to get a place for your child to go if school is not open.
Everyone keeps their masks on the kids, are getting meals and hopefully again not bringing something home to grandma, Just because she can't work the iPad, so I feel like they didn't advertise those Learning Bridges sites enough right.
That was our issue just the fact that after school was not available, but the Learning Bridges sites were operating while the kids were in person.
Oh I was asking my husband because he has a lot of people in education that he knows and stuff like that, and.
Like I, don't know, Julia said easier for people to use the actual remote learning that they're, providing because either way it seems like the issues would remain like if you're having a hard time doing remote learning it doesn't seem like homeschooling would necessarily be easier.
Don't know that would really solve the problem of people who need home school or would think homeschooling would be a better option for them, and.
Then you know, as Julia said, like still meeting the benchmarks that are required and things like that because in New York like you mess around and don't send your kids to school, you'll have ACS knocking at your door and stuff, and it's.
I. Think it's next week, one of the Education Committee Council meetings to see more of what the needs are, because even just sitting at this in at the Cec 17 meeting, I really didn't hear people complaining so much about the school.
This is how we prepared for in-person learning, but from you know my recollection other than like, How can my child stay a part of the community.
And, you want like a good home learning environment, but lack of devices.
We've heard that, through you, know, like legal aid and stuff, like that, The people who defend parents and kind of issues.
I want to be fair when it comes to those households that may not have internet service or that they have a guardian or an elder as the child's guardian of what happened, What you're saying is exactly what the district's office criticism was about the NYCHA letter, because that was the assumption that it's only Nycha's students and residents that don't have access to internet and Wi-Fi. You know that was the letter that went out for the most part.
I, don't know if that is still current, I think if the board of education, if you have the choice between remote and in class or in school, it should be the option when they started talking about these devices, It should have been a choice.
Like I said he was coming home with a book bag full of stuff, every single day, and it's not just what he's learning on a laptop.
Right they're, saying like this pandemic is showing how poorly schools are doing for the students and I, don't necessarily and the solution.
I think we need to like figure out how we can bridge this communication divide, because it's showing some kids are getting good.
That's why they should have the devices so that they can learn from their teachers, whether it's at home or at school, or at one of these Learning Bridges, sites.
I can try to get some like the teachers that I know they range from kindergarten, all the way through high school.
You know the needs of your students, because I know sometimes there's like eight kids.
Think one thing we want to know is: What are the.
These are things I mean if, but, If you're, not in the meeting, you're, not going to know about that, but these are things that the DOE is providing like.
And I wonder, At least they had school, it's a few, You know what I mean, and even people who are speaking.
