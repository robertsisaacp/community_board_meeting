Then, you know we and for the most part, those that we are rounds will continue to be safe, and that's all that we can really advocate for at this point in time that the individual will do what the individual can do instead of looking to outside courses, for you know to tell us that people's not only afraid of Aids or.
You know I kind of feel like the laws around these masks and Covid-19 and individual responsibility.
Is my redundancy to make sure that the meeting is actually being recorded and Miss Henry, Youth and education starts at in one hour, so, hopefully, parks wraps up, I know.
Well, Miss Dorothy is on friends of Brower Park as well: Miss Dorothy she's on Nicole, but, Like I'm gonna, be doing a lot of the administrative stuff.
You can just give us a summary of what you guys are doing and if you need support from the committee, let us know what you're doing so.
You need flyers for your event, we'll try to get that, go, get it to the community board and then print it up for you, okay.
Somebody's at the home, going here, I, don't know who it is.
There was a problem with a lot of people hanging out in the front and doing things in front of the garden so, and they said, and Miss tires was saying that the gate was open and they were doing all you know some things that you know playing cards a lot of things that you know that needs to be changed.
I mean the garden the garden's going to be kind of closed for most of the winter to let them know that they can't be going into the property.
You, know playing cards and doing other things and fixing their cars in front of the building in front of the garden.
They do have a few people that are planted a few things in the garden, but I don't know if I sent you guys a picture.
There make sure they have proper lighting, you know, and so I'm going to reach out to them and see if they can send me a summary of that meeting.
You know to play with in the playground, so they're going to make sure that the equipments are age appropriate as they get older that they can.
But I think one of the they have a very strong community there, because there was one guy who was very concerned about what they actually put there and they want to make sure that it's appropriate.
Because the buildings to the right of the park there's a lot of craziness going on there.
Yes, You can sit there and then all of a sudden, You start running you know, but then what they were trying to do when they went there to do some renovation they had to paint.
I, don't know and more meetings with the community, So we can kind of break the ice.
So I think it's just going to take a little time because it's been like this for years.
I think there were at the meeting, but they were like I said there was one particular guy.
You know I want to because, Just like we say we're going to spend all this money they're going to spend all this money.
Well, you know, I'm retired, now from work and from the school I used to wait for the bus right in front of that building there on the corner and one time I was waiting for the bus and the people started, shooting each other across the street, And. This is why I keep asking about the security of the place, Because to me it's like cancer.
Actually, there's a big emailing and phone calling campaign right now, because the parks department is not renewing the leases or three big composting facilities which handle most of the food scraps that we pick up at the Monte and other gardens.
They're going to have to haul these food scraps probably to fresh, kills in Staten Island, oh wow, and the thing is that there's the parks doesn't seem to have any particular reason to close them.
You talked to partnerships for parts about this because I know they work closely with the parks.
You know his legacies are going to be shut down the composting center, not a great legacy.
After, a big fight, They put back 2.8 million dollars, It used to be about I, don't know five times that so they have begun picking up again at drop-off sites like the garden like Amani and dozens of other places, but they've relied on these composting.
You know it's not really conducive to the park setting because then the animals get in there and things like that, because it's just an open, bin.
So we know members of the organization have, in the last couple of weeks, cleaned out most of the food scraps, and so now we're going to do this leaf breaking event on the 12th to kind of fill up.
Still like you got a lot of things planned anything okay, So moving forward to kind of prepare the park for winter.
Going on and things like that, I'd, say: I, Don't have a green thumb, I'm just kind of more to do administrative work for the organization.
I, don't know if I'm regarding or anything like that.
You know a time where the park gardener can be on hand to direct and guide us to teach us how to properly prune, okay, good.
Okay, all right, so I'll send out we'll send out another link for that it'll be, for you know the same time on the 5th
