Negative mm-hmm They should have a site up here on eastern parkway and ocean avenue, , there's Brooklyn hospital 35th street, and what first avenue remember I was in and out of there in 15 minutes, 20 minutes He was able to register those documents with acres, automated county registration information system, the county clerk's office, where all the deeds have to be registered, he's a reporter for the Brooklyn paper, The marks a successful completion of a effort to get community planning into a neighborhood rezoning So, as ms tyus pointed out, with the city council's approval of the grand Pacific rezoning, the agreements that the community board reached with the developer, emp capital became effective and the restricted declaration was registered with the the governor finance and and, as you saw that's now available on acres.
We made public all the terms of that agreement related to its various enforcement provisions, Given the fact that we've heard of the last land use meeting that the department of city planning now does not foresee being able to complete the euler process for the impromptu zoning during the course of this administration.
Should we be presented with other private uloc applications, and- I, think we've already kind of been through with the general structure of the community benefit agreement and the nature of the the controls and enforcement that are in place with respect to grand Pacific Trying to accomplish I think was important, and the unique thing here is This is an avenue site where the crown from the community board wasn't asking for industrial type of artisanal type uses, but the developer put that out there and it gave the community an opportunity to leverage a little bit of additional community value, bringing something that was meant more for the mid blocks on an avenue site.
Looking at bringing people in from the american planning association to give people training in land use planning in new york city, if you're interested on your own, we're starting to turn towards equity, racial equity and social equity and planning and environmental equity and economic equity and planning, and all the things that we have in the backs of our minds, for what we want to see in our community district It is available on the automated county registration information system, acres, which all which covers four counties of new york city registration purposes, Four times in addition to the emails that he sent earlier, we don't want to circulate the cba now, because dcp is not able within their budget We expect to see a lot of private applications coming through all right so and the more people get a chance to study what we did with the first of its kind So another thing that folks on the land use committee need to know is that property owners come to the land use committee and then to the full board based on what they told the land use committee as an application.
We would want to be able to start at a higher level, and you know seek terms that were as favorable to the community board, given whatever future circumstances exist as they possibly can So. By releasing the specific terms, we would just be undercutting ourselves, we would be giving future participants the benefit of the legal advice that emp got, and it's not There's no problem with reviewing the whole structure of the way the cba works, but when we get down to the to the nitty-gritty and the very specific provisions of enforcement, again, we'll always want to seek the best The best terms we can possibly get for the community board.
They chose a zone that was in scope that was generally consistent with some of the m crown maps between the community board and city planning, so the other lots could have been totally cut out or it's because this whole process of getting a community benefits agreement- That being said, my question is so when we voted on, you know to approve the well, and it was this very complicated, like conditional sort of approval that we did for this.
Sarah, the at the time that the board took its vote, which I think was in november, I think it was the november general meeting we had We had no text of an agreement, only the desire to have something that had that could be enforced as opposed to simply having a letter saying a developer has an intent to do something and in fact we do have something that has relatively strong enforcement provisions through the department of buildings and also through also through specific money remedies that the community board Yes mr crassus is asking the resolution was for r7a.
This is something that directly flowed out of the experience with 1010 Pacific street was actually what we distributed earlier today to the committee, so the property title as maintained by the city of new york, provides for the restricted use and that provision will be binding upon any future owner of the property, and likewise the community benefit So. All of the again, both in terms of monitoring through the DOB enforcement through money damages that are collectible by the community board and also a restricted declaration that runs with the land.
