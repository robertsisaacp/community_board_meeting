So, as ms tyus pointed out with the city council's approval of the grand Pacific rezoning, the agreements that the community board reached with the developer, emp capital became effective and the restricted declaration was registered with the the governor, finance and and.
Should we be presented with other private uloc, applications, and- I think we've already kind of been through with the general structure of the community benefit agreement and the nature of the the controls and enforcement that are in place with respect to grand Pacific.
We would want to be able to start at a higher level, and you know seek terms that were as favorable to the community board, given whatever future circumstances exist as they possibly can.
We would be giving future participants the benefit of the legal advice that emp got, and it's not There's, no problem with reviewing the whole structure of the way the cba works, but when we get down to the to the nitty-gritty and the very specific provisions of enforcement, again, we'll always want to seek the best.
Probably the committee members remember there was a suggestion that owners of a couple of those other lots be given an opportunity to accept the same terms that emp did for the in exchange for the same community benefit.
I put it in for a up zoning city planning in their quest for harmony on the skyline, will stick in other neighboring plots and lots to give a structure to what their visual image is for that Coming in this, one that gibb was just referencing was, is across the street from the main applicant's property.
So we will continue to work with city planning towards the m crown neighborhood rezoning, especially because a number of private applications coming through and new and larger buildings going up will put so much pressure on the existing infrastructure that we're just asking for problems.
They chose a zone that was in scope that was generally consistent with some of the m crown maps between the community board and city planning.
It's because this whole process of getting a community benefits, agreement- My question is so when we voted on, you know to approve the well, and it was this very complicated, like conditional sort of approval that we did for this.
We also discovered that the developers who had done the rezoning for a 1010 Pacific street and had made similar commitments, but had done so only through a letter of intent with the city council, member, had sold their lot and those commitments were no longer enforceable.
We had no text of an agreement, only the desire to have something that had that could be enforced as opposed to simply having a letter saying a developer has an intent to do something and in fact we do have something that has relatively strong enforcement provisions through the department of buildings and also through also through specific money, remedies that The community board.
Second point in the resolution was that the applicant make a binding commitment to allocate at least 0.25, far of the commercial ground floor to m crown uses and that the commitment takes a form that provides for monitoring and enforcement and survives transfer of ownership of the project of the subject.
There's no question about that, and if this ties will allow I'm happy to talk about how the community benefit agreement specifically addressed, monitoring and enforcement and and transferability, I think you need to do that.
Actually, what we distributed earlier today to the committee, so the property title as maintained by the city of new york, provides for the restricted use and that provision will be binding upon any future owner of the property, and likewise the community benefit.
Things satisfy all of the requirements of the second provision of the board's resolution from the november 2019 general meeting.
You know, as they did with atlantic yards, which we could have had more enforceability of the community benefits agreement if they had something called a bond covenant which would have tied them to what they promised and given that this has come coming from the community and coming from the community board per se, we have a limit as what we can do with private property, and this is the best way that we can make sure that some fashion of our vision comes forth.
