The thing that if I was to have a movie, it would be getting parents on track to save our future generation. I'm the wisest person that I know Mrs Sanders is this part of your meeting, or is this someone that needs to be muted, you're, muted, Mr, Saunders yeah, just Allison right now, the only person I see yes, I'm here good afternoon, your YouTube live has started. I, don't know how many people you expect I sent the reminder notice out yesterday to the entire community. So hopefully, in a couple more minutes, there'll be a few more people yeah. How are you doing today? I'm doing well. Thank you. How about yourself, how about you, Mr, Allison, pretty good, just got in from work, but excited to be here. I'm loving that plant behind you. It looks very happy. Thank you, I just watered it. Yesterday, it's the word of mine they're. Looking at me like mommy we're dry, exactly hey Mr Allison. Are you interested in joining the community as well? Yes, that's why I started to attend. I know this is the second one and before it was on a little hiatus, but I'm interested thanks for coming on Board Chris yeah. This is I'm uncharted territory for myself as well one second, some people are asking me some information offline. So we really don't have that much going on right now, but we do have something that has to be done dealt with the bank of popular I, don't know if he was on a previous meeting. Yes, okay, so I'm just trying to get the community committee together. So we can present it in for January and make it happen and see if we can put some stipulations, but can we do stipulations with them? Also as well Juliet sorry I was not paying attention. What was that with the bank popular with it with the proposal that they want to come before the board? Can I put stipulations with them as well? I, don't know I, guess it would be the banking committee that would be regulatory. Is there a student committee with the city? Well, I'll bring you up, they have a program and they need to support the community board, but I just want to make sure that the community board is involved with them as well as far as like as the financial literacy and different programs that they want. Oh yeah I was skimming through. Oh, the birds are joining us today. I was skimming through the proposal earlier today trying to work on the minutes a bit. It seems very theoretical to me just making sure people know about the information I mean if you want to clarify to bunker popular that you definitely want to work hand in hand with them aside from just giving them the support, that's definitely something you can do, but in terms of what that would look like for the board and what the district offices involvement would be, I'm not sure that that's something that could be stipulated because it's not necessarily a city agency, so it's not or even a state agency. So I'm not sure what the regulations would have to be. I would definitely have to check into that further before even the definitive answer. Okay, hey welcome aboard everyone, hey Kim, hey Celine, princess and dad how's your day going so far complain with the uncles. Okay, I guess: I'll give a few more minutes, but basically I was just talking to the office and I know slain. We met before off offline just talking about this whole thing with bank of popular I kind of postponed it until January I, don't know if I could hold I, don't know if I can hold it off another month, but you know for their support and I. Believe economic development is very important. This term of need in the community and I took one has well. I've been asked to share it and I'll definitely the support of fresh eyes and new blood and hope to see what we can do in the community and make it happen as far as the groundwork and moving forward. What we can do is make this a better community. You have anything you want to add in on Kim Miss Robinson Sorry, oh you're, muted. Let's do it is there any way we can Kim you're, muted, oh okay, you guys can hear me now. I'm sorry I said I started off, saying I do apologize, Brian I didn't drop. The ball I spoke to Janiece from me, boys, 16, just briefly, and I wanted I basically asked her. If you mind talking to you and I was just to explain in details like what they did, because they also went through the same thing with banker popular but I dropped the ball with the council members, my passing and just some other family stuff I did drop the ball and I apologize. It's okay, things happen. I, have my hands full right now, also from my family as well, but you know things happen, you could pick the ball up and keep going hey princess. How you doing thank you good evening. Everyone I'm fine! Thank you, don't be forced, but for the economic discomfort of the long-time community, which is primarily like the african-american community and I feel like to do this. We must gain economic power. I believe that you must have more big business owners and more entrepreneurs. We must create a platform that will allow kids to learn this for free and not have to go to seminars or have to learn about the stock market through paid on advertisements or anything like that. Okay, do we know who that number is 917 ending at eight three: hey nine one, seven, five, six number! That's hey mark! How are you doing how's everything, I'm doing good, sorry that I had to call in I was just on another call. I'm gonna know who's, I'm standing and death, and also can you give an introduction from 2 6 number yeah, hello, how you doing I'm good. My name is Sarita Dawson, and this is my first time coming to this committee. Welcome Board. Thank you for your participation. Thank you all right. So, okay, 6:23 I, know we put start at 6:15. So what we were talking about was basically bank of Popular has a program that was involved in operating since 1995 or 1997. They just brought up in our community this year. So there's a little couple questions I was asking as far as about you know the purpose of now bringing it as far as why, when why wasn't it broke before, but I'm not living in the past, so living continuing right now in the future. So there's different things: I just wanted to find out. I, don't know if everyone has a copy of the deck that they had like map. I could put it in the chat or Julia. Can you put it in the chat? Do you have it it's a pdf, so I'd have to share the screen. Give me one. Second, let me pull it up. I, don't know, burn all right. I'll see you, okay, Brian, I'm hanging in there. It's just cold outside. Follow me one more time. Please I said I'm hanging in there. It's just cold outside it is it's here, get some more warm weather, no snow, okay, you're right! So, while Julius brings it up. Okay, here it is. This is the pdf that banker popular basically shared? This is their deck and I. Don't know if everyone got a chance to see it, but we can run through it real quick again, it's a banking district. Let's see, can everyone see it? I spoke a little bit about it before and they did a couple presentations. It's basically the purpose to encourage the establishment or profitability of commercial bank branches in designated locations, known as a banking development, district, otherwise known as Bdd. It is established based upon demonstrating need for banking services in the community and supported via New York state and New York City low cost deposits to those institutions. So basically they start this. They saw a banking district in that community and they did the passage from New York state and New York City and matching from New York, City I believe there's a 10 million from state and then this the city is supposed to match it with another 10 million and with those funds they're supposed to do implement different programs as far as financial literacy, how to fix peop individuals, credits, small business, banking loans and it's supposed to be tracked by the state also and as far as like. What are they doing? These workshops per month and yeah there's supposed to be results for participants gaining better understanding of the basics of banking measures by our internal survey platform and number of new topics. That's the goal, one to go to the boasting on Boister the credit profile consumers within the banking districts within the community development through support of small business development. Let's keep going down, so you could see in our community support in 2019 Banker Park Bank, what's called popular Bank New York Metro region posted in three well 317 events with 420 employees, volunteering in total, 625 hours of service. Basically that's talking about. What's with what they do, the financial education as you can read ongoing pledges to volunteer time in our communities a plan to guide those partnership is without they supposedly partnering with financial literacy workshops, strong company, employee, volunteer participation, various career fairs and stuff. Like that also the deposits, you know hopefully you're going through this while I read, you know, skim over it and read it also. If I'm going too fast, let me know slow down. You know. You'll have a long day and I'm trying to try to do this as best as I can so, as you can see the deposits, the products that they're going to do, there's checking accounts money, markets, savings accounts, deposits, the department's credit builder for business and personal loans, wealth management, cash management, you scroll down and, at the end, is basically their corporate structure. You know, as you know, a popular bank is based out of San Juan Puerto Rico, but they've been at this location for as long as I know, he also has been born and they've always been here and this bank one on Eastern Parkway and no string. Avenue would service the whole community board eight within the confines of community board. Eight, I'm still learning about it. You know over the holiday seasons, everyone that basically is on holiday time, so we're picking back up the ball and asking different questions and also, as Robinson said, that someone from CUNY Board 16 who dealt with it because you know reach out to me- I'll reach out to them and find out more I, had an offline meeting, also with a few individuals and we're just talking about how can the community benefit from this whole banking district? They want and not just get a fluff job. You know just come in and just get out support but just actually work hand in the apartment ship and be able to have a more of a I'll say. So how is directed who it is helping and not just you know, just anyone, basically just helping the people in the community that are not financial literacy, make sure that they're directed into those individuals who really need to help and not just looked over I just hope, they're done for any questions. Anybody any questions they want to ask or any comments, don't be afraid, say something please, I'm sorry go ahead. Yes, sorry Brian, as you, restaurant and barn hurting tremendously right now, organizations I'm a part of is the lack of eligibility for funding due to low credit and credit repair in public and, for example, spanish Mandarin. Is it just me, or does she sound choppy? A little chopped? I was just kind of wondering they had just asked me if they're just an organization, a bank or anything that was doing any funding that didn't rely solely on credit scores, especially in the last I'm hearing that that's been a huge problem to obtaining funding and language barriers as well. I mean that's something we could definitely find out to be honest. Bank of popular is what popular bank is called, is our based of out of Puerto Rico, so I'm sure they have to have some type of, not just you know, English, but Spanish and I, don't know as far as other languages also, but there's something we could definitely find out and what I plan on what I plan on doing? We can also speak to Leo, and we can do another for next month. Do a quote with Leo on the phone and have them speak about everything and find out where I can find out myself and get back to you by the next meeting as far as like is but as far as the communication and reaching out to different the black and brown communities and other cultures also as well. I don't have the specific numbers as far as community board eight, as far as like the breakdown in front of me, but I'm sure I can get to get that from community office and also do maybe neighborhood Advisory board right as well princess, but there's something to look into and I. Don't know. If I can answer your question, but if I didn't, please feel free to ask me just I, guess you can bring it up to the bank or to Leo if it's a that they're considering when it does down to funding and the funding comes down the pipe in January, if they're going to use other measures in how they perceive somebody to be eligible for funding other than credit score of the you know, minorities who don't even know what a credit score is: okay, I guess, I didn't answer your question. I would definitely find out and ask that, as far as what other measures that they use for loans as far as credit scores until it's a good question and I'll find out, you know, actually both of us are going to find out together and we can bring it back to the committee and also with denials of CUNY Board 16 their office would actually don't go into this process with them. I can get more information from them as well, and then we could be guided by them and see what we can improve on so Brian. In the previous meetings, it seems as if Franco Popular wants us to point them to particular organizations. I, don't know if we've readily identified them, but there's some particular populations. That I think we need to carefully look at so I have a few. If you would just bear with me okay, so you know with the pandemic we're having it was having several issues. So Celine is quite right in looking at the access to capital access to credit. But specifically, you know the they use a target phrase which is an and ultimate methods to establish credit worthiness, which is something that Celine was trying to get to so previously, because all of this had originally come by because of Cra, endeavors and I know chase, maybe 20 years ago would take qualifications such that. Are you a good participant in your suit, so that would address you know persons that are traditionally unbanked that are coming from the Caribbean and you know now we have a much larger community, so you would actually have to look at the Crayola speaking community and those that are speaking Urdu, because if you look at the footprint of board, eight, a large percentage of our scholars attend district 17 schools. So one way you could source information is you know partnering with the Cec or they have a group within the Cec coming from the Cec, which is looking at title, one issues and title: one: monies are directed at low income students, so I would imagine that a low income family, particularly with the effects of the pandemic, might be challenged. And if we go further with that premise, then we have to look at how does one become stable after an economic event like the pandemic, which causes understanding? So you know long way to get to there's a need for support there. Also within community we have a high home ownership rate among persons that are considered seniors in the 70s to 80s and 90s. Although many have wills, many don't, but more importantly than having wills is the knowledge and the access to creating trust in the states. So I think that's something. That's going to be particularly valuable. Last thing, if you look at a recent article in eater, was describing all of the restaurants and small businesses that are closing because of the pandemic, and if you look at our commercial corridors that primarily support persons of african descent or from the african or caribbean diaspora, you're. Looking at the time that they've been in the business and the businesses that are closing have been in operation between less than fewer than 10 years, but most critically, the ones that are closing the quickest are the ones that have been established in the last five years. So looking at means possibly accessing funds. Providing business support to those small businesses might be something because there's no organization that I know of within the district. That does that, and maybe that's one way that we can use as a strategy to strengthen our merchants associations, especially along the Utica Schenectady Nostrada and Franklin Avenue corridors right, one. Last group. We also have to look at and it's not strictly board eight. Then the institution is located in board nine, but we have many students that are attending Medgar, Evers College right. So in the many students that attend mega Evers college work to pay their tuition, it's not unreasonable to assume that many have lost their jobs because you know college students tend to be low, wage or retail workers. So how do we help them become more stable? So they continue to stay in school. So you know again an opportunity to partner with new, if not mega, Evers directly, creating a partnership between CUNY and I'm sure mega evers would be looking for a lifeline within their student life, Department Student, Life Office, whatever entity they use that covers that. So that would be important. And then you know not to forget that if we need to incubate an organization, the board does have a friends of organization. So we could incubate an organization for two or three years and spin it out so that we would have that ability on an ongoing basis, particularly for the tenure of this program, to be able to support our community. That way, thank you very much. I actually been thinking about the friends of Community board, eight, as well as how you know. How can we I guess be able to be that point of contact as far as providing the financial literacy and it's a great tool to be an incubator, because, for example, an organization I belong to what we're known for is establishing some social program, for example like something like mentoring, teenage girls in foster care, helping support that program and then turning over to the community. When you turn it over to the community, it has enough it has wheels under it so that it can function as an independent enterprise. So to leave something long standing would be great. That would be the opportunity my feeling about popular is that they want to hurry up and get this done. I want to make sure that we hurry up and get this done correctly. Exactly my exactly that's my accountant like we're on the same page also I want to acknowledge our chairperson. This is chair of the tournament Ethel Titus. Thank you for coming on. I'm glad to see everything is moving along. This is excellent. Thank you all for coming tonight and thank you. Mr Saunders, for picking up the baton and moving this forward. I do want to remind folks that over the early fall, Crown, Heights, North, Association and Milton Avenue, Bar and restaurant group, newly formed would be a good source. I believe that there were lists made and names taken, and they would be a good start for the things that Ms Wetterburn was suggesting in addition to the other commercial corridors in our community district. Thank you well. Thank you very much and we're very lucky and we're fortunate to have one of the members of embar on our committee as well Celine, and we just had someone else a couple. Other people joining drew Gabriel. Thank you for coming in and I have a 757 number I, don't know if you can introduce yourself real, quick and let us know who you are. This is nice, chica handy, I'm not sure. If you can hear me, I'm also on the call to join in with Celine hey how you doing how's everything pleasure to meet you again and I also had a chance to speak to you in your videos. Resources are very valuable and also you know, I don't know if you want to introduce yourself and let the people know who you are in your background. Okay, sneaker. Did you hear us hear me? Okay? So, oh I'm so sorry about that. My apology, so I know we appreciate I personally reached out to you for some of your knowledge but Celine as well from bar I just wanted to know if you just give a brief introduction and tell us a little about yourself as well hi, yes, my name is Nishika handy, I'm by trade, a project manager, a lot of the projects I've worked on have been in finance. I've worked in a few different areas. Some of them have been youth development and community development. I've also had some experience while living in Washington D.C in some government economic development and thank you Brian for inviting me to be on the call for particularly participating and look for working together with the committee and helping this one of our first projects with the popular bank and many more as far as helping and developing with the community, and does anybody else have any comments or statements they want to make. What I'm looking for this is new to me, and you know I'm a former business owner and the community as well, and what I'm looking for is. We have a mixture of people that has been involved with the community as far as being on the community board working city agencies, government, and we have new people also. So we have a big multi, multiple of resources and I want everyone to come together and what we can do in this time of need. As far as helping people in our district survive and make it and I think that you know right now, I feel it because I as I walk and drive down what, whether there's no street Avenue Kingston Avenue Utah Curtin, just seeing the stores closing and speak from different merchants like they don't know how they want to survive, what we can do or whatever we can do to help that's what I'm here, for these are just it's kind of this dear to my heart, you know I, myself, I personally, trust no I cook at home, but I try to go to the restaurants and just go there and support and make sure I support some. You know one restaurant or store a day and just make sure that I show my support and that's just the way, I feel what I personally do you know and I encourage anyone else to do that to this they're struggling out here. This is a time times where I, don't think anyone's really experienced this before and it's uncharted territory and for myself and for all these, the business as well, unless, like whatever we can do to make it happen or make it work or whatever resources we could put together, because everyone right now, as far as from I'm hearing from I, was on the court of the day with the commerce Brooklyn chairman of commerce and I. What I heard is, if this is, if you don't know, you can either miss the date, don't know how to don't know how to be approved for it, your credit score or you have to be in business for what a couple of years since 2008. So there's just these different stipulations in there and then it's you don't know. As far as a community yeah, a lot of us are from a black and brown community where we all we know about, is just working and open a business or just open a business and work for 10 years. I really don't know the background as far as how the business really works. All we know about is just collecting money, making food and surviving hands-on for day-to-day and right now, they're hurting. So whatever we can do to make, you know, make it better or easier, I'm down for it, and, let's just do let's do what we can do. Okay, that's all I have to say right now is anybody else want to say anything you know so about it, but hey why everyone else spoke drew. Did you raise your hand yeah? How are you doing yes, so here's a I mean I was just thinking as I'm hearing you speak. Yes, so there's a lot of business owners that don't know the right questions or how to ask for help, or maybe they may not be comfortable. How about creating I'm gonna use this loosely like a space or something a virtual event where information can be shared, so whether it's you know we can call it especially with what's happening now with the pandemic. Everything is virtual right, so those are the people who may not have access to a computer may not know how to use the computer if we could create some, like a virtual workshop seminar, lack of a better word where they can ask those questions like okay, I have this business. What do I need? How do I move from here to here? What do I need to in order to keep my business going, those type of resources or those type of information session to just really, because I find a lot of the business owners, especially the mama, the small stores, don't know how to ask those big questions. They don't know how to apply for those grants. So those money, that's there because one they didn't have the paperwork or they didn't know how to do it. They're so used to having everything in the bottom drawer that now you're telling them that they need to apply for something. But it's like they need this paper. You need this form. How do I get it? I, don't know how to write this, because I feel like in looking at everyone on the line we're. So everybody has something to offer, but at the same time, if that information is not shared, it's like we're going to be just sitting here. Having this same conversation over and over, what do we do to help small business owners when our business owners don't know the questions to ask because they're so right now them is just trying to keep their dough open is trying to provide for their family, so I think if on this group, if you can, we can put our help together and start saying: okay, we're going to address the business owners. How do we address the owners? How do we express and short of going knocking at the door to do and having that conversation, but when I, walk and I look at the stores, and I'm just in talking to people I can tell you what comes out in what is like I, don't know what paperwork they tell me, I need and by the time I get to have that conversation. It's too late, I, don't know how to do this. I've been doing this for 20 years. This same way, I've been using my 10 fingers. To add I know you're telling me I have to use you know as a card or I have to get this I. Don't know any of this I don't know how to balance my book because it goes in the drawer. It goes under the bed. It goes under the mattress. It goes somewhere like. How do we get to help those business owners to get it to the next level like to help them think outside the box, where it's? Now it's no longer? This is where we do business. You can still have your same business, but then we have to now take that model and bring it into this new virtual world. If that makes sense, actually it does. You know I made a lot of valid points. It's almost you know, like you, said, seniors and the black and brown community. They could go through foreclosure, getting ready to go through foreclosure and not say anything and say anything help or anything like that and just go through the process. Let's get their home for closed on and what, if they would have reached out, we could have got some kind of assistance. Some type of help, so I, don't know if it's I guess that the pride or just the not the knowledge of not I, don't know what it is, but it's not knowing. So it's not no I, always say. If you don't know the right questions to ask, you won't ask, and for you know we have seniors. We have homeowners right now, who just really don't know when their letter comes they're, so afraid they don't even open it by the time they open it. The person is at the door knock and get out so I think somehow we have to try to figure out. How do we get that information to them right without it being that old, now, you're coming to take my home or sorry, it's too late, I think a lot of times is that they don't know what the right question is. So Saunders make a couple of suggestions. True, okay, we have some very sincere people on the line. I think Ms Robinson is making very good points. If we can divide up the work and the work I'm suggesting would be to pick five or a number that you decide on pick a number of merchants and actually call them and ask them to attend the session where we can get a representative from the city's small business services agency to come in on a virtual call and have copies of the forms that they would have to submit. The business would have to submit for any particular grant. So we have a actual working meeting with knowledgeable people from the city agency who's charged with getting these grants out the door, but in order to get the intended recipients to attend, the meeting we'd have to make phone calls so that phone calling would have to be divided up amongst select committee members. That's just a suggestion on my point. All right, then thank you. Mr Peach! This time is up, but this right now is the time more than ever. We as black and brown people need to unite it's the for the business companies I mean for the businesses right now, it's for them to do or die. They need to organize. They need to become merchants associations now more than ever, where that once their emergency association, instead of come instead of knocking in individual doors, which is good, but it's not productive in time. If they're organized as other establishments are organized within, it could be done, it could be presented and shared in a much more efficient manner, and we can put everything together for them, not just us. This, the elected officials, whoever we have go on, where whoever we have involved can do presentations for them as a group to help them out it's similar to what on a smaller concept, is what nbar did when they had. One of the economic presenters come in and speak about what went on what's going on with the funding so right now it's more important! We as black and brown people to from the business aspect to join courses for their survival, so that we can so that it'll make us more efficient or make not just us make all of the elected officials, their services more efficient, to give to get that information out to them, because we it's not productive for us to tap on each one of their doors. If they're structured in a way that that's organized it makes everyone's jobs much better and when they're organized they can ask for things, they could demand for things and they get more information. So what we need to do is I mean is to let them know they need to be organized Nostrand, Avenue, King, Nusten, Avenue and all the side. Streets needs to be organized, Kingston needs to be organized and all the sides, all the side, Street Establishments, Utica Avenue. They need to be organized and all their side streets need to be organized once they're organized. Let them come together as a crown heights merchants and just touch base with each other and get all the information together or their strip could be organized and get information in. As elected officials, it could be more efficient to get that information out to them as your job, and our job is much more efficient for us to get that information out to them if they're organized. So it's critical for them to be organized for their survival in this environment, because we're if every elected official out here is going to say, I have no time to go to knock on everyone's door. If they're, organized and destruction I can come here and I can knock off 50 of them in one shot and give them all the information. Let them bang me out for an hour two hours. They can ask me any questions they want. I could I'll be able to do whatever they want. I'll stay here for hour, two hours, three hours to take all their questions and it's much more efficient than that, and that may cover everybody on the strip. So it's essential that we push them to be organized, so it could be efficient for us and everyone else to get their information out and for them to make it through this winter. But that's my thought on it. Thank you. Mark does anyone else, have any comments or anything about elementary. If hello, Celine I guess she was dropped, hey guys, I'm willing well Notion Avenue of Mbar started something and okay you're back you're, muted right now, you're still muted. You have to mute yourself, okay, it's still muted, but I'm really, you know, I look. I looked at mbar I saw the beginning of it also with your mark every and so what it has become and what it still can become. I'm willing, with a few others, with the assistance of a few others, to hit some of these other streets and see who we can identify as far like as far as doing the groundwork and identifying merchants like Salina and commissioning something on those streets as well. If you get a couple of us to go there and to initiate and try to help them organize, that would be great as well. I, don't know if there aren't organized as far as the merchant Association of Utica, Avenue or Schenectady I know, there's some people in Kingston, but to actually help and organize it, and you know I'll be willing to do that with the synthesis of others. Celine. Are you able to meet yourself now and continue to you he because I think and muted myself? Yes, okay, so what I was saying is knocking on doors and make is making phone calls is laborious and not necessarily realistic across? But if there is a budget to create a postcard, not a not and not anything, people are scared of with you know, with some writing on it. That will grab the eye and say hey for me right now, nbar meets now with Brian's founders is on our call. Brooklyn of small business recovery specialists. There are obstacles on 12:14 we're putting together an in-person merchant's meeting at Jeannette's hair salon at 12 P.M. Anybody who is interested in hearing what's going to be happening at that meeting. Please that information out, we have a flyer I'll, send it to mark or mark might have it already and he can send it out. I spoke to Robert looked at my establishment. He was able to make contact with him and was thinking at the position all of us are in and how left out feel so he'll be at that meeting. I'm trying to get Donald John Eldoras there, which is the commissioner of SBS, but even if he's not there, a representative from his office is most certainly going to be there, but we are getting together and we are having this meeting and we do have to be heard and we do need the information to be out there a lot of the times. Even if you have these people there, nobody even knows what questions to ask but having a safe ally, I think in places where you don't really are, for. You helps as well just creating some like a friends of small businesses, type of mini committee on these merchant organizations, where we can, you know, assign one person per every two or three blocks for these merchants who you know are older or who aren't from here can feel safe, asking what they may feel like it's a dumb question just is websites government websites. This is all of these organizations point you to. They are not the easiest to navigate so again. Maybe if we could get a postcard mailer, how you know they got the sensor information out, they found it in. Maybe this is something we can start pounding into the heads and the homes and the places of business as a resource, but a real resource where people actually answer phones or visit their businesses make an appointment just anything where they can feel included in a way versus virtually because that's just not it's not always tangible for everybody. Although it's a very simple and effective way of getting things done, we're talking about the people who don't trust it or don't know how to do it. I'll actually try to reach out before we have the clinical office, but reach out to him tomorrow, and also the chairperson chairman, Titus, as far as what we could do is doing like the cards and hands outs and trying to do it and with your assistants as well. If we can make this, you know bring into action also with the help of Miss Robertson with anybody else. I'm a little old school, so I mean I'll drop. My phone number in the chat well for those who don't have it, give me a call and see what we can do make it happen for those who do have it I mean what whatever you can do, whatever we can do together to make this happen, I really appreciate it and, like I said this is uncharted territory for myself as well and for me, and for many and hey, we hear the weather. We scroll that making anybody else have any comments or anything they want to add to it or suggestions or anything. How are you doing how you doing Sharon again I just wanted to, because what I think I'm hearing is that they're, you know like because the Economic Development Committee was Miraban. I'm hearing two different needs one. We have this offer coming out for from popular and two. You can hear that. There's the need for general assistance among emergency merchants, or you know what I perceive, because, just as you have I've been walking through the community and seeing open storefronts, I'm even seeing storefronts that replace the former favorite business now going out of business. So I don't know Julia do you know if we have up and running merchants associations which merchant associations are running up and running up or down oftentimes, the only one that's like active is the north Flatbush bid. I know new friend was trying to come up, they've been trying to come up for a while Kingston the same and they'll get some traction, and then it will just stop. Nothing like this hasn't been back there for a vanderbilt hasn't been active for a while Washington hasn't been active in probably four or five years now, but James Ellis. Would be the one to talk to about that he's the one with CBA? That's been spare heading the revitalization of the merchants associations in our district, and that was outside of his membership. It was when he was with the chamber and he continued even after because, rather than reinvent the wheel, because I know old school is good, but part of the problems that are some of our merchants are having? Is that they're not up to they're, not in the 21st cent century? You know, they've got the great business idea. They know what they're doing but part of. What's getting. Everybody caught, especially the businesses that have ten years shorter than five years, is the fact that they're, not using technology or they have the access to information. Much to Celine's point so I. You know I'm just a guest, because I'm not a member of the committee but I. You know I know what it's like to take a large pie and try and chew it. You know. So if we look at what the key issues are and prioritizing well, you know I, you know, as I said so. You know like cutting into too bad, but I think we would be remiss if we don't have the opportunity that popular is offering to us and use it effectively. Julia, yes, Mr, Thor and I know you were working with no string as well recently as of last year. Yes yeah with Kingston and Utica. Do we have a point of contact for those for that association that they started Utica, never Utica hasn't they had zero traction, not much interest for Kingston. It would be James Ellis, I'm not even sure. If the businesses he had been working with are still there I want to say that the North Kingston portion they were trying to start one. There were a couple of businesses that were trying to band together. I want to say the end of last year, maybe the beginning of this year it was oh I know the LLC name is Kingston Public House, it's the bar restaurant, a block away from soul, food kitchen, I, want to say between Dean and Bergen or Dean and Pacific. I'm not sure, don't get me to lying. Don't quote me on that, but he might have the most information, but I do know that James Ellis has been the one that he's been the repository for the merchant's information for us for no strength. I know you were working with them. Jackie and Willa had been trying to step into the position, but she comes and goes like the tide. So I don't know if she's still active, I, don't even know if her business is still there for Washington the last person that was operating it was Brad Nichol, but he let he left the association when he sold his business and Vanderbilt was being run by Ellen Fishman. She was kind of quiet for probably the last eight or nine years, so Brian Saunders might have more information on that, since he just had a business on Vanderbilt, so he might brian. You might be the one to have the most information about Vanderbilt Left, but I'll definitely find out. If anybody I'll, probably reach out to you, know, give the pony you probably know, since he did the whole street. Actually you know thing kind of want to say. I definitely will say that give his mistake and a lot of stepping up a lot on Vanderbilt, so definitely phn DC for Vanderbilt Gibb, especially and I, was I. Just thought of a name and I totally forgot it. Oh well, yeah give has Vanderbilt locked down, I mean they're well organized and they got it going on over. There we have to be Franklin is pretty organized also. They have a lot of stuff going on over there we have to be concerned with Nuston is working on that Kingston, Utica and Going. East is a concern and we have to see how we can get them organized and get that information out to them, and let them know that we're here to support them, but, more importantly, for us to support them is for them to support themselves and for them to work together. As a group because divided you fall and at this time soon come don't go no more, they need to get it together and so that they can survive for through this winter and coming into spring, and hopefully that you know they we they can definitely work on that without support. Definitely I know: I got a list of names from merchants with liquor license so I have that, but definitely gonna get a point of contact. I'll reach out to you Julia tomorrow, see who I can talk to and start from there, so just reach out I mean it's something close to my. You know dead to my heart and I like to see what I can do and make it work and also I mean hey. I know this is trying times and everyone's busy a lot of people have things going on in their lives. I know myself as well and I wanted to say thank you for coming on this call taking the time taking your time to come and assist and help others that that's in me and I appreciate everyone and I want the best for everyone, and you know from about my heart. Thank you for taking your time. I really appreciate it, this one and if I don't mention you buy anyone this one's outside just keep saying. Thank you. You're welcome all right! Everyone. If we don't have anything else, I'm gonna, try I know it's a little long. You know we have everyone have things to do, but if we don't have anything else to say, I put my number in the chat please reach out to me. I'll tell you, I'm old school, hey call me: let's we can hit the ground running whatever wait, don't check it mark. What's that's what I always say and whatever after this my comment, anybody else have anything to say. Then we just call tonight have a good night, God bless or whatever faith you believe in so we're gonna have mark, say what you want to say: we need if we can get on the committee. We need somebody on the on Utica and on Kingston that lives down there. If we can get somebody a part of the committee involved with those areas, I mean that lives in that area or part of the merchants under on our committee would be extremely helpful. So you know we'll I guess if anybody knows you know, we can definitely reach out and see if we can bring them on yeah. We could do like we did that night, where we just walked up and down the street and look at that different story. You can do that again and hey, hopefully it's not too cold, but what whatever is needed? Man, whatever? Let me know, what's up, you know, I'll, be there with you, my brother, okay, I, appreciate it. Hey. Does anyone else, I'm gonna say one more time: hey come on, you be quiet, you gotta say something man I could come along for to walk too. All right. You have my no! You have my number text me call me whatever. Let's make it happen, okay, listen! I, don't know everything, you don't know everything but hold us together. We can make it happen. So that's what we're here for all right. So on that note, I'm gonna do like the Russell Simmons used to say: God Bless have a good night. Thank you. Take care. Okay, good night, everybody.
