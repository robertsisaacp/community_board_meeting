Is this part of your meeting, or is this someone that needs to be muted, you're, muted, Mr, Saunders, Right now, the only person I see, Yes, I'm here, good afternoon, your YouTube live, has started.
One second, Some people are asking me some information, offline, Yes. Okay, so I'm just trying to get the community committee together.
But I just want to make sure that the community board is involved with them, as well as far as like as the financial literacy and different programs that they want.
I mean if you want to clarify to bunker popular that you definitely want to work hand in hand with them aside from just giving them the support, That's definitely something you can do, but in terms of what that would look like for the board and what the district offices involvement would be, I'm, not sure that that's something that could be stipulated because it's not necessarily a city agency.
I, have my hands full right, now, also from my family as well, but you know things happen, You could pick the ball up and keep going hey.
Basically, the purpose to encourage the establishment or profitability of commercial bank branches in designated locations, known as a banking, development, district, otherwise known as Bdd. It is established based upon demonstrating need for banking services in the community and supported via New York state and New York City low cost deposits to those institutions.
Then this the city is supposed to match it with another 10 million and with those funds they're supposed to do implement different programs as far as financial literacy, how to fix peop individuals, credits, small business, banking loans and.
You know over the holiday seasons, everyone that basically is on holiday time, So we're picking back up the ball and asking different questions and also, as Robinson said, that someone from CUNY Board 16 who dealt with it because you know reach out to me.
How is directed who it is helping, and not just you know, just anyone, basically just helping the people in the community that are not financial literacy, make sure that they're directed into those individuals who really need to help and not just looked over.
I, don't have the specific numbers as far as community board eight, As far as like the breakdown in front of me, but I'm sure I can get to get that from community office and also do maybe neighborhood Advisory board right as well princess, but there's something to look into and I.
If I can answer your question, But if I didn't, please feel free to ask me just I, guess you can bring it up to the bank or to Leo. If it's a that they're considering when it does down to funding and the funding, comes down the pipe in January, if they're going to use other measures in how they perceive somebody to be eligible for funding other than credit score of the you know, minorities, who don't even know what a credit score, is.
Until it's a good question and I'll find out, you know, Actually both of us are going to find out together.
Celine is quite right in looking at the access to capital, access to credit, I, know chase, maybe 20 years ago would take qualifications such that.
One way you could source information, is you know partnering with the Cec or they have a group within the Cec coming from the Cec, which is looking at title, one issues and title: one: monies are directed at low income.
I, actually been thinking about the friends of Community board, eight, as well as how you know.
I've also had some experience while living in Washington D.C in some government economic development and thank you Brian for inviting me to be on the call for particularly participating and look for working together with the committee and helping this one of our first projects with the popular bank and many more as far as helping and developing with the community, and does anybody else have any comments or statements.
Looking for this is new to me, and you know I'm, a former business owner and the community as well.
Avenue, Kingston, Avenue, Utah Curtin, Just seeing the stores closing and speak from different merchants like they don't know how they want to survive, what we can do or whatever we can do to help that's what I'm here, for these are just.
You know one restaurant or store a day and just make sure that I show my support and that's just the way, I feel what I personally.
Yes, So there's a lot of business owners that don't know the right questions or how to ask for help, or maybe they may not be comfortable.
So those are the people who may not have access to a computer may not know how to use the computer if we could create some, like a virtual workshop, seminar, lack of a better word where they can ask those questions.
Because I find a lot of the business owners, especially the mama, the small stores, Don't know how to ask those big questions.
I, don't know how to write this, because I feel like in looking at everyone on the line.
Having this same conversation over and over, What do we do to help small business owners when our business owners don't know the questions to ask because they're so right now them is just trying to keep their dough open is trying to provide for their family, So I think if on this group, if you can, we can put our help together and start saying: okay, we're going to address the business owners.
I'm, just in talking to people, I can tell you what comes out in what is like I, don't know what paperwork they tell me, I need and by the time I get to have that conversation.
Almost you know, like you, said, seniors and the black and brown community.
If you have these people there, nobody even knows what questions to ask but having a safe, ally, I think in places where you don't really are, for.
You helps as well just creating some like a friends of small businesses, type of mini committee.
I just wanted to, because what I think I'm hearing is that they're, you know like because the Economic Development Committee was Miraban.
And he continued even after because, rather than reinvent the wheel, because I know old school is good, but part of the problems that are some of our merchants are having.
I know this is trying times and everyone's busy a lot of people have things going on in their lives.
