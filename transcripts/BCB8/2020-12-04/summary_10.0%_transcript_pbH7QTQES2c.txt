We, may have a third item: 294 Albany Avenue, If you can all agree to allow the latecomer who has not submitted his materials for his presentation ahead of time for us to look at, but we can see whether or not that'll work for us, so I just want to see if we have a quorum.
And I will be, depending on Julia Neil from the board office, to help us coordinate, things, Norah Daniel, the land Use Committee secretary and our vice chair.
Who was that hello, okay, moving on with the rope who's speaking well, This is Mississippi Mrs Ida Ramos at 859 Pacific street, I'm, on the line for a building of 840 Atlantic Avenue.
All right, 14, All right, moving right along first item on the agenda is 875 San, Francisco, Avenue, Crown, Heights, North historic district, and this is a second presentation by the architect for the project which is to legalize the work referenced in the LPC landmarks.
As I was saying, You may remember: I presented this project at the last White News Committee Meeting right, here.
I'm, hoping that everyone had a chance to see the documentation and some of the materials that we had sent to the community board in support of the situation with the developer of Boaz Gillard and how he left the building pretty much in the lurch and a little later on after my presentation, One of the owners of the building will also would also like to speak and discuss some of the information that they've researched regarding grants and tax credits that might be available for historic, properties.
The only remaining items left are the side bays on the building and the reason that those items have to go to public hearing is because the material that was removed during the first when the developer worked on the building was historic.
Like prior to the renovation, but we're able to find these two pictures, If you look on that screen, one and two one is the building before is renovated and two is a detail of what we could see of the bays and.
At one point we really didn't know what was there, because we don't have any good photographs of what that actually looked like you can see if I go back to that.
Up, Originally I was able to use my microscope and just determine that this is actually what was there, except now we're proposing and based on our presentation with you and landmarks.
You look over into this picture, so some of it's still a little bit undecided, So we're having these discussions with landmarks as to what the final color is going to be.
They don't seem to mind the color of the stucco because it blends in with the brick, but ultimately, when we present to landmarks and in our discussions with the deputy commissioner and the staff member we'll touch on that, I think it has to be clarified what they would actually like to see.
I think it kind of blends in nicely with the building, although I think I might tint the roofs a lighter gray, to match the stone color of the front, and the other question had to do with what was the design elements.
It sounds like a lot of things have been resolved with landmarks, which is great, but since you're going to public hearing, I want to understand what specific things are.
Why we postponed it initially, because we weren't had things to work out still at staff level with LPC, so that the community board would have a say and also have some input into the process.
That's actually been realized that we can look at and see what it looks like I think I understand all of the other elements that you're proposing, but that one is throwing me a little bit.
And, if we can move the mailbox away from the building, Landmarks is okay with us, putting it closer to the sidewalk at the front entrance, So it doesn't interfere with the look of the building and the light posts they're fine with that being where it is in the fence, The rear, yard, they're.
I just wanted to share some of my past experience with similar issues from other projects that have come before the committee on the stucco.
So I implore you to look for the historic composite, stucco that'll last longer or use the wooden fish scale that could be available from a supplier like diced lumber here in Brooklyn.
All that said what we'd like to do is once we get a full approved scope of work from landmarks.
We would then like to go out to see what types of credits or federal grants that we might be afforded, but unfortunately we can't do that until we have the work ready to go and a budget approved.
I just want to suggest to you that you not wait until you have a signed contract for every specialty that you're going to use to do the work that you're planning, estimates, Will, work.
I just want to mention one thing: We've already started sending this out to various contractors to get pricing, but it probably will take a couple weeks before we get comprehensive pricing on this, but we hope to have something at least for the landmarks public hearing, which is on December 15th, okay.
I'm, asking the committee members to come forward with the motion on what you've heard this evening on this project at 875, Saint Mark's avenue to legalize things that the fire owner did outside of Lpc's approvals committee, members.
This is James Ellis Committee member I would like to just add into some language about what the understanding that the other violations have been rectified at LPC, that the presentation at the base, be it just be more explicit saying that the other items we are not making the most.
We have a motion on the floor to support the legalization of the work on the bays at 875, Saint, Mark's avenue, using historic, composite stucco, and we recognize that LPC has removed violations numbered in the original presentation ending in 1025, 1027, 1032 and 1033.
Okay, I just want to mention that there are a number of different composite stucco mixes out, there.
It's for everything proposed for the bays and there's an agreement there with Miss Iceland, there's wood framing for the Windows and Mr Ellis believes that we still need miss young to officially accept, which is true, the second, the friendly amendment.
Okay, Can you please read the motion again in its entirety, we're supporting the recreation of the Bay Windows using drawings, lpc005 and 006 of December 1st 2020, okay, Miss Collins, but Mr Christie Ellis made an amendment to add.
This sounds like conjunct, yes, okay, I believe also princess.
You want to share your email, address, Mr, Ellis, sure I'll put it in the chat.
This is an application for a new stair bulkhead and Roof Terrace mechanical equipment to be located and roof adjacent to the new bulkhead, and this is in the prospect, historic, district, And I'm, not sure who's.
Okay, so give moving to support with the second from this Weatherspoon all right, any other questions.
Yes, I, don't know if Mr Ripple has left, but is this going to be presented at the board.
Okay, and you want to talk about the composition of the door or anything like that.
Okay, and so this door opens out onto a rear deck, yes, rear deck, It looks like there's.
Okay, I have a question a lot of the time in these presentations.
Okay, This is an entree to ask you to return to the land use committee in January.
We need to ask you to come back in January and give us the details on what you're proposing, because right now we're not sure so we're looking at January 7th.
I. Think she's, asking about be notifying the neighbors is that the process there will be an updated form with the land, use, Committee infant meeting information that will be sent out to Alexander and anyone else.
Okay, so that we have a more comprehensive understanding of the proposal other than the pictures with a door.
It is that we're looking to review the applicant is proposing a rear, yard, a window, a change, That's already been installed for a sliding door.
That's, going to go over to a deck with a new railing, but comprehensive review of the plans being presented also shows the front door is being switched that there's a new painting, color scheme.
So, all the other elements of this presentation, the pdf version, the paint color the front door, the rear yard extension elements, That's already been approved at staff level, so is it am I to understand that you're only seeking approval from this community board for the rear yard new window edition in the railing.
That was the only issue with landmark she wanted to present.
Okay, so I think that's where we're asking for you to articulate what it is that we're looking to approve on in this application.
My recommendation is to ask for a fulsome presentation at our next land use committee meeting and I'd like to know if anyone else on the how many of you on the committee agree with me.
No, just I, think I don't have enough information on the table that okay Committee here Mr Satan, yes, I, did hear him.
That's, not clear to me right now, because in looking at the designs, I thought there was also a part where they wanted to build another level.
This is from second floor, and this is only extension, and all of this is metal deck at the top of extension and more this space, and this sliding door goes on this metal deck, but we want to get a pro from here, and this is how it looks like on elevation, and this is side elevation.
So again, I would like a motion from the committee on this item before I asked the mo yes for the motion.
It looks to me like we're being asked to legalize work.
Tyus, hello, Ms, Tyus, I'm, here, yes, I just want to bring to your attention that we have a chat box full of our members who are asking for this application to be tabled.
My motion is to my motion is with the thing that no violations that we would like to table this until our next committee meeting more developed presentation of application.
I think it's about a more comprehensive presentation on item proposed.
Lpc will get a letter explaining that we've asked them to come back to the land use committee meeting and then to the full board meeting for January.
Okay, so we have a presentation, but first I want to thank the land, Use Committee and the community board for hosting us.
This is an application to rezone the aforementioned property, from m11 to c63x and with that establish an MIH area and also amend the zoning resolution to allow wider more pedestrian friendly sidewalks when the new building is constructed, which you'll see later in the presentation, As some members of the community board I mentioned, earlier.
So we're excited to be here tonight and to show you what we've been working on as a lot of people know this site in that it's adjacent to the Pacific park.
Just so, You can see what the current lot configuration is in kind of in a an actual, understandable context of what the project site is bring us down to down street level.
Now on the hundred foot wide Vanderbilt, with the 20 foot wide sidewalk, the Mcdonald's immediately to our right in the open rail yards to the left to the west, bringing in a little closer for everyone to see the project site has a handful of residential buildings in the middle of the Mcdonald's.
The rezoning, If approved, would facilitate development of a new 18-story building with approximately 316 units, of which 30 would be earmarked for affordable, housing, The building would also include a non-residential uses on the ground and on the second story, back to up above.
But, then the most recent development of node in the area is what's being developed at 809 Atlantic across the street, a roof height identical to that which will come with Pacific park's, partial 10, a 312 foot, roof height, and this development will include 206, total residential units with 86 units of affordable housing, and this the city planning and the city council and others have deemed it appropriate, given the very wide nature of Atlantic Avenue and the exceptional access to not just local public transportation, but regional public transportation.
And this is the stack of what this mass looks like in its effort to try to work with the surroundings around it and provide that transition that we discussed to the lower densities to the east.
It matches the l-shape of the development site itself and the building, like we had said, includes over 300 units of housing, of which 30 would be earmarked as affordable housing units, and at this time the development team has proposed to use option two for its MIH compliance, where the weighted average of the income bands will not exceed eighty percent of AMI a way to kind of think about.
A number of discussions with city planning, we've proposed an amendment to the zoning test to facilitate much wider sidewalks, which we think is appropriate for such a wide street, where pedestrians are often quite close to traffic.
How many lots are like that on occupy presidential, we'll provide the community board with a better synopsis of the you know, the number of residential units that are within the development site and what their status are.
This building is asking for two to three far more than what we have proposed along Atlantic, Avenue I haven't heard any talk about what would justify that other than zoning context, and I'm.
If we were to go along with something like that, it would absolutely have the effect of creating tremendous development pressure on the lots to the east and would be very difficult in my view, for the community board to ever get back to the six to seven far that has been outlined for Atlantic Avenue in the imprompt zone.
That has come to us with a proposal for development, and if we start this way, it's going to be very difficult to keep the density on Atlantic Avenue, to where the community board and the elected officials that have partnered with us on the crown vision, have pegged it.
And yes, that is beyond this, the six to seven, that it sounds like your that the community has identified for Atlantic Avenue.
Don't think that the community is going to lose its opportunity to maintain that six to seven far grasp on Atlantic Avenue.
In fact, we think, like we had shown some of the prior images that stepping down to an 8.8 here from the more dense developments to the west is going to set up future land use actions moving east on it on Atlantic, Avenue.
We, think you know we're land use attorneys, we represent property, and this property is, in our view, uniquely positioned to be part.
You know the city's effort to develop housing, including a very notable chunk of affordable housing within proximity of public transit, on concrete on streets that maybe aren't at least at this time, particularly pedestrian friendly, and that these improvements will better the quality of life and will not put the community in a position to you're not going to be in a position to have R9X flying on inhibited east.
I'm, also a member of the Kronaites Tenant Union, and you can be sure that affordability is a serious concern in this neighborhood and all around it, and you know proposing something like 80.
I mean I know that many of the members of the landings committee are familiar with what's permitted in those districts, and so at least at this time the owner is exploring any of a number of them.
And I want you to know that community board 8 is continuing to work with city planning is looking at this community board as a partner, and we've been very clear with them that we are standing Pat and what we feel we need for this community to be healthy and economically sound.
We will be working with city planning to try to get pole position on moving M Crown neighborhood rezoning ahead, so it will be like two cars racing.
