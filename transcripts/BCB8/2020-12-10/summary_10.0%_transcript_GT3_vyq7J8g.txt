Okay, So now, I know that there was a letter that was going out regarding the privatization of NYCHA through a section changing it from section nine to section eight, which would allow for eventual privatization, I'm, hoping that someone can bring me up to date on that anybody care to speak to that issue.
I think that the comment period for the hearing on transferring NYCHA from section nine section, eight is still open, I'm, not sure I, hope Ms Granville will be able to confirm Lomas Granville back to you, okay.
Anyone wanted to comment on that letter that went out, I'm, not sure if it was shared to the committee, The housing advocacy committee on the transfer of NYCHA from section 9 to section 8.
Yes, All right, I get to mention that to you, because the state people had their from what I understand they had a hearing at 5:30 yesterday and the one for the City Council Committee was held at 11 in the morning.
If, like, for example, is City Council going to get to actually vote on this, or is this just something where we want them to express an opinion one way or the other, but I figure.
If you're going to use the dilapidated condition of the buildings to try to qualify for section 8 in order to finance the bond issues that you're going to need, It makes me wonder if there was a plan all along to let things just fall apart and then propose this, because you know the city has a way of letting things go when they really don't want to be bothered, and then, at the last minute.
And I want to let my committee know that I'm going to write, but if you feel compelled to write something to put your feelings on paper, please do so as well, because I'm sure they had a lot of people who knew before we did that the hearing was going to take place.
And I wouldn't want these folks to think that, Oh, they netted Albany houses, but they were impressed how things were because we were not Sarah.
Okay, I will tell you what I have, which is based on I, think what you probably have sent Ethel and Elsa sent it to me and what I'm going to try to do when we finish is send a copy around to make sure everybody gets one so that you'll see it.
Nycha has told us that this is like the school construction authority, but, Unlike to see the SCA, there is no option to approach City Council for money if private investment fails or the trust is unable to make a debt payment.
It's exactly what's wrong with this whole private public partnership quote-unquote, because we have no control at all over the wages the workers are making it just left up to the marketplace, and this is you know why this is such a bad.
It's nice to see Weeksville garden, getting completely made over God. But when this day is done, all the money ends up outside the city, the real money you know, and so this is the model, that's happening with the tax lien sale, exactly where these private developers are buying up these tax, foreclosed properties and a fraction of their value, The city's getting no money.
All the money's flowing out of the city into these wealthy people's pockets, it's upside down and backwards, and you know it needs to stop I.
So a lot of the things that we are seeing right now when it comes to public housing, it was in the works long before Bill Blazer take over, because Bloomberg had sold a lot of city buildings and in privatizing a lot of public housing.
It, into a co-op, because a lot of people in public housing are paying rent, And I, think that is something we need to work.
It wasn't that, like a program way back in the 60s and 70s, which is how New York City Housing.
Actually nationwide public housing became the derelict thing that it is right now, like didn't.
Because things change in New, York City, The next thing they're gonna go after is these big public housing and a lot there would be more displacement.
We need to get on board and meet with the people who live in public housing and see how we can help them to become homeowners and to become owners of these apartments, because some of them have been living there for years and people is under the impression because you live in public housing, you don't pay rent, and that is not true.
I. Something people need to get away from because you live in public housing.
Some people are educated because I know somebody who had two masters that were living in public housing.
So doing it in businesses, as Ms Callahan, just said, I think we need to work for them to do it in housing, and you are right.
I think that there's definitely movements at the city level for abolishing the tax, Lien, trust, Classic, De, Blasio, stuff, It's, De Blasio doesn't want to continue or wants to continue doing things business as usual, because it's easier than making hard decisions.
So the tax, a tax, lien trusts, say I'm making numbers up but say they say that they're going to sell 175 million dollars worth of debt for that year, And what happens is that a private company sells 75 million dollars worth of bonds and they give that money to the city.
It makes me think again about what I had just read, to you, guys about the trust that they want to set up with the unit housing.
I think Cambridge model, because I guess the CEO of NYCHA used to be in Cambridge Massachusetts and dealing with their public housing.
You know it's so funny that people want to latch onto things that were done in other places, but is Cambridge comparable to New York city I.
One of the things I think they came up before was the fact that if you had a contractor, who was doing that and the contractor changed for the job, are they legally bound to continue to train the young people or the NYCHA residents, as they once did.
Would I don't want to use the word educate but help them to fight and as residents of those building their rights and help them to work, to become owners of those apartments and become stakeholders, because I think when you're a stakeholder in a place, you put more interest in it and if they become stakeholders, it's a better chance of they keeping the place up the standard than just being a tenant.
I agree with Ms Benjamin, It turns it seems like we are going to turn into a bunch of lobbyists for the public good and as part of our job as members of this community board.
I want to mention the fact that when we did meet at Albany we did have a couple of meetings where a lot of the residents came to the meeting, and they spoke about the fact that, yes, there have been times when they have gone to Albany the lobby for certain things, for housing.
We should ask someone from the appropriate section of HUD to come in and talk to these issues appear at one of these meetings and tell us what they see from the inside and hopefully give them some recommendations that we think will go a long way towards solving these problems, and we also need to have people come in from the different night to tenant groups to lock arms with us, so that we can hear from people with a boot on the ground to tell us how we can help and put that in writing.
You know the housing organizations together and trying our meeting to bring more.
The ones who were there to speak, But you get the impression that when certain groups decide that they're going to make changes, that's going to affect a lot of people, they purposely downplay it and don't give it any press, because when you oppress people to a certain extent it is a form of abuse and abuse is very easily done when nobody knows that, it's being done, So it's purposely kept under the radar and purposely not spoken about, because it's something like the NYCHA people are totally mystified.
And I'll say this to you years ago, when the public housing in this city was planned, it was planned in areas that nobody else wanted to live.
So I agree with you that there has been limited press, and that has been intentional and with all the people who live in public housing, Would say more than a hundred thousand, with all the different developments we have as far as I know, I, don't think they even have any type of a newsletter or newspaper or anything like that where one group communicates.
The media, like Kathy Island, is suggesting I know with a ongoing issue near where I live on sterling place between New York and North Street, where a giant housing development is being planned for a sterling place between New York and Brooklyn avenues.
All you hear about in our city is how we not taking care of our homeless, But if we let NYCHA go to the point where people don't have a right to the apartments to the point where private developers take over, can you imagine what the city would look like as far as homeless people concerned.
We got a lot of flack when we had that joint meeting with HPD about those two sites, because a lot of you all said, especially people who are new to the community board, see some of us have gotten kind of used to the way the city slowly does things in a way they don't make sense when they do stuff.
And you know, and also they've, been waiting to take action on a lot of different things until everybody was waiting to see what is the federal government going to give us in terms of Covid-19 relief.
Okay, So we we'd have to use a succinct, pointed snippets and say who we are and speaking for, the housing advocacy committee for Brooklyn community board, eight.
You know: this: the candidates for City Council, on where what they're thinking is about this.
And apparently we have had a mayor who did not believe that at all, when people pulled his coattail about certain things that went on in the city, nursing homes that were changed over and sold and then raised to the ground and stuff like that, So I, think that's a very good idea.
You get the impression that a lot of the people who are in the churches who live in the neighborhood, don't really know.
What's going on and the people who informed the neighborhood about the Hebron school project, They did a terrific job, because I had a neighbor who never comes out to a meeting, and she told me she knew about it, because somebody approached her in the grocery store and told her about it and gave her a flyer.
That's the type of outreach that you need, because the precinct council people are home owners, but most of them don't come out to the community board.
We know a witch housing committee, the City Council, the council, yeah Carnegie.
Okay, I want you all to realize that, as part of the land, Use Committee, I've added our elected reps to the Google group and they're working representatives.
I, don't know how you all think, but I have tried to tell people, especially new board, members, that as far as I'm concerned, housing is never boring and land use is never boring.
And, you don't come away with something that you didn't know when you came when you sat down, please let me know, because I think it's very important, that you learn something that you didn't learn before, that you possibly make a contact that you didn't make before, because if not, then I don't want you to feel like you wasted your time, because everybody has other things to do and as far as I'm concerned community board the most democratic form of government that we have.
I'm getting intonations from both DCP and HPD, that they don't want to be bombed with accusations and being cursed at God. Knows what else during the first round of discussions that were had on the proposed projects for Dean and Bergen, because they asked them, did they really feel like they were.
Kathy and I see your hand also Robert, all right, so we're going to try to keep it organized and I recognize that HPD said they were had met with the community when the community board had not had any meeting with them, nor had North Prospect County's Forehead Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Council, so they put a lie out, there.
If there's anything that can be done in order to not exactly to I, feel like people will be more respectful in their participation, if they're sure that they're going to get a chance to say what they want to say, either.
Dcp will be in the background, because when we're not around you're talking to each other, because I was just thinking of these previous meetings and the thing that everybody had wanted to know.
I think we should prepare that it's community board who needs to be advocating for the community, and so you know, as well as the developer.
Think if we do that I think we would see a lot of changes because they would realize you know what, but eight people who live in this community mean business in a way that you know what I need a votes and if I want their votes, because other communities hold his elected official fee to the fire.
