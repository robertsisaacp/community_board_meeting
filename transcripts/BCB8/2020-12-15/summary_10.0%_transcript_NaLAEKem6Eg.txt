So we've come up with kind of three broad topic is starting with population demographic trends and also housing, and then we hope to come back to present on capital planning and infrastructure planning, as well as information about land use and zoning and massing, since in particular, so we'll be setting aside dates in the upcoming months.
So, Let's get started so, as Jonah said, we're first going to take a look at the citywide trends, so that consists of population growth.
And, then we're going to look at job growth and then looking at housing, affordability and then moving on to racial composition and the changes action of the city and.
We recognize that New York, City's population employment, has been greatly impacted by the pandemic, and we expect to see that reflected in future data.
So we're going to look at population growth over the last 100 years, so pre-pandemic New York City's population, was at a historic high.
So, As I said, There has been slowdown in recent years of population, growth, Recent and future federal immigration, policies, of course, impact that growth and what we're seeing right now with the pandemic, that's obviously going to impact growth as well, so we're going to take a look at what makes population growth.
The take home from this presentation here up from this slide here is that New York City's population depends on natural increase and net international migration to sustain its population.
There were about 10.4 million jobs in the region in 2017, and a population and jobs were the densest at the center, which is New, York City job growth drives in migration and keeps the population from leaving, and so the workforce in the region, which is about 12 million pre-pandemic, is larger than that of Boston San Francisco and Seattle Metro regions combined, and we can see here on the like country map on the right.
A lot of people have lost their jobs, which has exacerbated rent burden issues, and we know that the ratio is high in some of the poorest areas of the city.
People in those areas are severely rent burdened, So we looked at this very quickly earlier, so I want to come back to this New York City's population has grown and changed a lot, and it's become more diverse over the last 50 years and in the 2012 2016 ACS, the American Community Survey New York City's population is comprised of 32 white non-hispanic, 29 hispanic, 22 percent, black non-hispanic 14 asian Pacific islander and 3 percent other.
Over, the last 50 years, The hispanic and asian populations have increased significantly, while the black population has remained largely stable, and so here this is the citywide change in share of the white population.
You look at planning and regional planning, There are two reports on job growth in New, York, City and in the metropolitan region, and I think the compensation data would probably be in ACS as well, although trying to get average across everything, Maybe a little bit challenging I put a link to the geography of jobs report that Winston's referencing in the chat.
So moving on to the neighborhood trends, agenda, we're gonna be looking at population growth, age, household composition, race, income, education and industry of our data is sourced from the decennial census and the ACS.
Looking at the last 50 years, the context area's population has was the highest in 1970, at around 130,000 and in the 1970 following city-wide trends.
This was due to city-wide economic downturn and the flight of the middle class that we talked about in the first half of this presentation in 1980s in the 1980s there was a 12 increase in population, and a lot of that can be attributed to immigration from the Caribbean and Latin America, in particular, between 1980 and 86.
Those two districts grew at about three times faster than our context area here, and then we can see here also that cd9 prospect left, roads, gardens, didn't have any growth and actually I decreased, had a very slight decrease of 0.1 percent, and then so we wanted to look at age distribution in the area.
Here, I want to remind everyone that citywide trends point to a population in the city that is aging median age is increasing every year and more people are staying in the city than before.
So, In the context area, there are about 26,000 non-family households, and that was a four percent increase from previous estimates, So here we're comparing 2006 2010 ACS data to 2014 2018, data.
Only Cd2 has a comparable 54 percent share of non-f of non-family households, So we also wanted to look at demographic change in race and, as we see here from this graph as the population grew, the demographics of the context area have changed significantly since 1990.
In 1990 the context area population was over three-quarters, black, which is represented in green here and under 12 white non-hispanic.
Since 1990, the black non-hispanic population, has decreased by 43 percent and now comprised of just over 40 percent of the overall context, area, and during that same period, the white population went from 12 of the share of the population to just under 40 percent.
So, the share of the context areas- population, that is black non-hispanic-- is a third less than that of cd8, which is about 58 percent.
Area's white non-hispanic population is nearly double that of cd8 and follows Brooklyn and city-wide trends and the context area has a smaller proportion of hispanic and asian populations compared to Brooklyn and New York City.
With that graph that we saw earlier, We wanted to take a closer look at the change in the black population here and in the neighboring districts.
The share of the black non-hispanic population has decreased in the context area at a higher rate than that of Cd8 9 and 3.
This ties back to city-wide trends, there's no conclusive single cause for this decline, but we do see a lot of movement of different groups city-wide, As we saw in the slides before, and we've seen a decline in natural increase in the black populations, citywide.
Charts, you can see that so median household income has increased from 62 thousand 000 to 81,000 in the context area and that median household income of 81,000 is higher than that of Brooklyn and of New York and households.
We, also looked at percent of households living under the poverty line, comparing that change from 2006 2010 to 2014 2018, So 11 of the households in the context area live under the poverty line, and this is half as many households living in poverty as cd8 and a lower rate than that of Brooklyn and New York City.
These are the two industries that grew that saw rapid growth and then so that consists of about 45 percent 46 percent of the overall population in the context area, while the other half of the population work in these.
New York City, especially Brooklyn and Manhattan, had gained a significant number of jobs since 2010, as we saw in this presentation, citywide housing production has not kept up with the significant job growth in the area, leading to increased demand and rising housing.
May I, miss Thomas, may I just point something out if I could about what Gibbs just said, which is that, if you recall the math of that Amy showed in the beginning the first half of city-wide trends in terms of where the share the different population types had increased and decreased, there is an overall.
Have any comment on the other, because I think it's an excellent question, So Gabe you're, absolutely right a lot of clearly that's going to be a huge increase in population for those new developments.
Some of the data that Amy showed was that those areas experienced similar trends that even the tracks that included Pacific park experienced so a change in black and hispanic populations, rising incomes, rising educational attainment and rising housing costs, and so we can get back to you on what we have for that specific census, tracts that pick up Pacific park.
A lot of agencies like DEP or Con Edison are closely looking at you, know: DOB department, buildings, data and permits that are being pulled and changes in population.
