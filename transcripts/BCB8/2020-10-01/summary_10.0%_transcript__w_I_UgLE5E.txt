We support the projects based on the benefits that it will bring to the hebron church and to the hebron school currently unable to use the building too, due to unsafe conditions resulting from years of deferred.
It will also allow a new gymnasium to be built in the new building and 25 underground parking spaces for school and church use.
We think that the building that hope street has designed is a good component and a good complement to our building and the blending of the elements of the current building with the new building, and I just want to say here that we respect the rights of all individuals to express their opinions on the matter.
, I'm, the senior conservator for jablonski building conservation 920 park place is formerly the Brooklyn methodist church home for the aged and infirm and is currently the hebron seventh-day adventist bilingual school.
We feel very strongly that the preservation research effort helped to inform the design process for this project and we endeavored to have the historic building speak with the proposed new building, both within a campus setting, as well as to have the new building respond to the neighborhood context in terms of height and massing and materials, and a variety of planes.
The team's due diligence efforts included looking at the LPC designation report, going to the site, carefully studying character, defining features of the historic building and reinterpreting these cues in a contemporary design.
We also carefully reviewed historic maps looking at the development of the hebron school over time, historic photographs and studying the context of the site and the neighborhood, and identifying local building typologies and building heights and massing.
Neighborhood of Brooklyn, which includes three historic districts that have been designated by the new york city: Landmarks, preservation.
In, her statement, the former Brooklyn methodist episcopal church home for the age of an infirm and now known as the hebron school is an eclectic brick and brownstone institutional building.
The easternmost edition along park place and the chapel connected to the 1889 building, either with a small scale link such as the chapel or a change in planes such as the easternmost edition, which allowed both the original building and the additions to read legibly the southernmost low-pitched roof extension at the rear of the 1889 building that is proposed to be demolished abruptly abuts and encapsulates the 1889 gable ended facade the fourth floor of the southernmost extension in particular exhibits an uncomfortable relationship with the original gabled roof, which is blocked from public view.
The southernmost extension does not rise to the level of architectural merit of the other, well-designed 1911-13 editions, and we feel strongly that the proposed demolition of this extension would not detract from the special architectural character of the building or the crown heights north historic district, 2.
Next, please, the team also looked at recurring patterns within the neighborhood, particularly the pattern of low-rise buildings located adjacent to larger scale buildings, as well as the pattern of green spaces located between the sidewalk and the street walls of the apartment buildings behind please.
Gable ends a play of planes, animating, the facades, brick cladding and landscape clothes that help to inform the design of the new building at sterling, place, and I would also reinforce that.
This entire project does include extensive restoration of the existing building complex at 920, park, and I'd like to talk to you about what we're proposing.
Our current massing does not use all of the far or floor error that is permitted on the site, and we feel that what we've done in the next slide, you can see that we've carved the mass of the zoning envelope to address the historic building at 920 park, the school to the north of us, as well as the other buildings you see in the neighborhood next slide, please.
As misha mentioned earlier, we looked at the school building and took cues from that in terms of the gables, the dormers, the variety of heights and the setbacks, as identified in the color-coded in yellow purple, pink and gray, on both the existing structure and our proposed design with bubbles showing those areas of inspiration.
We have the proposed masonry rear facade the courtyard space that lies between the two buildings, the existing historic structure to the left here And then, a small minimized, ramp automobile ramp that takes you down to the parking below the gymnasium is actually can be accessed from right around here, And, so that's accessible to the community.
This is the proposed view, looking north from new york, avenue, So again, we're seeing that gable, ended, facade on the corner and then the window dormers themselves with the building somewhat visible.
This is a view taken a little further up sterling place, again, showing that gable ended facade with the window dormers and then the the rhythm that's created as we go down the street with these varying roof heights and alternating materials.
The background finally, landmarks had asked us to show the impact of the existing or of the new proposed design on the existing building.
The new york avenue elevation as it currently is, and then the park place elevation Then this is showing that same drawing with the proposed design in it.
We can see some of the heights where we are at a 60-foot street wall on the on the second place, facade 72 feet with the setback penthouse and The building across the street from us Is. Actually, a 69-foot street wall, similar as true on new york, avenue.
The park, place elevation, showing the existing building in front Then the impact of the proposed design, beyond.
This point, I want to hear for two from two or three members of the congregation who have asked to speak on this issue of how the project was approved.
As you all know, from the presentation, hebron, school and church, has been in the community since 1960.
You aware if there has been any discussion about insuring that revenue for the sale will be going to the congregation community and the renovation of this historic building, because this is what happened from what we know?
We know that they want to sell the bill, the land, but how much money is it going to cost to renovate the building the carbon present building right, now?
The resident of the apartment building legally have the right to use all the church ground and keep in mind that it's going to be a school there.
My name is at the top of the deal with the recent conference and hope capital, and we all we all know for a long time to keep people's school, and we have tried for many years to find ways and the norfolk has come out with a plan, and that was a lot of qualities and one of which was the one that we have now that we picked at the time that the church voted Was about 101 to 16 for the project and at least one there.
You know there was just a lack of transparency even on our level of people who could understand a lot of the information, so let alone We don't do this, we're going to lose the school I mean we need money.
The project goes against landmarks, law, the partial demolition of the historic structure, its inappropriate scale and style, the obscured sight, lines, the significant adverse impact on the old homes, visual entity and the character altering changes to the open space are all in direct violation of the city's environmental quality review.
At best hope, street capital will participate in the affordable new york housing program and offer 30 percent of apartments under this program, but the program's name is misleading by design.
For over 15 years, local community members, including members of the crown heights north association, have offered to meet with the church's leadership in order to share grant opportunities that would fund the restoration of this building.
This greedy developer shows no regard for community concerns, is willing to desecrate a landmark institution for its own profit, has no real intention of offering affordable housing and makes corrupt, backdoor deals behind the backs of hebron's members for the sake of our community.
The entire former methodist home site is part of a new york city, historic district, the crown heights north 2 district, both the building and the entire grounds.
Your proposal does not take into consideration the needs of crown heights north community members in need of housing, many of whom have already been displaced by gentrification.
I live at 11 2 park place And I'm just wondering about the consideration of the height, because it's so in striking contrast to the neighborhood, despite the architectural renderings that are trying to prove otherwise, and I, think that the regulator monolithic masking of it and the lack of like any sort of considerable setback from the actual street are particularly jarring, and I.
Understand that there's going to be tremendous pressure on the community board to come to terms, and I know that projects that go to LPC usually end up getting built in some fashion, and You know if, for those people on the community board, who are interested in negotiating with the developers, what the markers might be for a project that actually benefits the people in the neighborhood, and I I'm, really just talking about affordable housing, as many people have pointed out, here.
You know the median income for black families here is probably 40 to 60 percent of the AMI, and so I think that if this is going to proceed in any fashion, the developers really have to choose the option under the affordable new york.
A, where you know where most of the housing is most of the units are available at 40 to 60 percent of AMI, and they have to build units that are consistent with what people actually need here and not sort of warehousing for freelance graphic, designers, and I.
There's going to be a building built here, it's really got to be much smaller and much more consistent with the neighborhood and really preserve the green space on the sterling place.
My, question is: Why was hope street capital placing flyers in the neighborhood advertising the development as a in quotes new rent stable as residential building with affordable housing units distributed throughout the community?
A building that first violates the landmark guidelines or whatever the laws are, but then also go about and not actually give what the community need, which is true, affordable, housing, we've seen it time and time again, Y'all profits before people profits before people.
Don't think development should have a negative impact on communities, but you know the church who has a solid stake in how this happened.
I've heard from them as well, and the church leadership And I'd, like to, as the council member, be given an opportunity to think this through have more dialogue and conversations with the community and not make a decision based on this particular call.
I personally have to say that for the number of very educated people who are members of the hebron congregation- architects, engineers, accountants, lawyers, that there is funding for building schools on private property under charter school laws and rules through new york state department of education, so that money's been there.
A lot of my neighbors, I have no problem with building new housing in the neighborhood, but it needs to be for the existing community, both in family sizes and rent, and that this building includes so many small units, like some of my neighbors have already mentioned, means that it's not built for families.
It will rob the neighborhood of space for buildings that do support families and schools.
I, don't believe that personally, but what I do know is that a developer, like hope, street, I, think you all would have given the amount of experience that you have quite a bit of knowledge about just how many of the units might qualify for affordable housing and what that might be set.
But what I want to make sure you understand is that your here and asking for the land use committee to recommend to the full board that they support this project and you're, holding back on information about a very important aspect of the project.
It includes housing, it's in a different census tract, so it would be informative and enlightening to the land use committee members who have to vote and that's a mix of appointed and community members.
I, have seen project proposers come before this committee and be bombarded with questions like you faced this evening and though that proposer said look you know, I had so many questions.
We were told that we were that the community board wanted to not only have us present to the land use committee, but also to the full board, and that, because the full court was not meeting over the summer that we needed to postpone until after the summer.
We didn't appear in the summer because it was not meeting and LPC said that it was the community board's preference that we make a presentation because of the scope and scale of this project to both the land use committee and the full board.
Beyond that, I would like to address the far-reaching financial impact on the community, though this building will offer the city mandated rent stabilized units.
The impacts go beyond this to the community members living outside of this one particular proposed building.
The project that was seeking approval was building a garden in the backyard and when the discussion was being had, they talked about how the Weeksville houses these amazing historic sites that exist in our district.
Obviously, the garden, won't look exactly the way that the gardens looked when the when people actually lived in the Weeksville houses, but it's of a You know this building that the school is in.
I live directly across the street from this project on new york, avenue between park place and sterling.
And I, see this beautiful property across the street, and this proposed project that they want to build here will totally destroy the neighborhood that I'm so used that I've grown up here.
Housing further I'd like to propose to hope street that they take a look at alternate: sites.
We can vote on whether or not to recommend to the full board to support this project committee.
Any project comes before the community, board, I, don't think it's.
Presenting here that a community board is expecting is expecting to see affordability at the median income that meets the neighborhoods needs and it's not affordable new york option c.
, I think that the significant issues have been presented by everyone on this call, those in support and those are posed, I'm in a unique position, because I'm wearing I'm on this call with three hats on one as a community board member one as the president of the crown heights, north association and co-founder and as a person, who's directly impacted by this project.
That said, I propose that community board aid that this land use committee not support this project as presented.
I. Second, that motion who was the second sharon wetterburn I, would like to, and this is give I, would like to make an amendment to the motion that and that amendment is that the committee not support this project as presented unless the developers reduce this, make a setback on the sterling place.
