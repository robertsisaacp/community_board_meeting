We recognize that there's been a lot going on in your neighborhood and and that we're coming in after a lot of things have happened around what we're asking you to do, but I'm here to tell you that you, many of you know me for two decades and David is a different type of developer than most.
And he's been in the neighborhood for years decades, as a business person, So he's coming to you right, now, recognizing that there are very specific desires and goals and asks that people may want to see and that there's a history that we're in the middle of- We do not need to be disrespectful of that by asking you we're hoping actually that we could take it to the next step and to create what you've already done, because I met ethel just before I've known her for years, but we met just before the pandemic, and she introduced me to what you've been doing with your restrictive decorations and the Rfa, and I found that to be very creative, because it's a problem.
You all know the neighborhood better than I Zoning district and right across the street, to the north of the south of us on Bergen is, of course, a residential district, and you can see that there's a school in the yard in the residential buildings, and Give the computer, a second.
Plate gives a nice big, open area for people to work and get things done, and I think achieve a lot of the uses that you're trying to see attracted, I think, could fit nicely in a space like this 23 foot, high ceiling heights and then above it.
We have the requested residential if it were to be approved,, 69 of which would be affordable, and I have not even explored with David who's, the owner working, maybe with different programs at HPD, because everybody in the city, who's in housing, should be thrilled.
You would even let us build it up, but that's basically the overview to what we're asking you for the rest of the presentation takes you through the neighborhood, which you probably know better than I do, but I'll give you just two minutes of the maps, so you can see the maps at least and understand what we're asking you for Can you can you just repeat the proposed number of affordable, units?
Mr Palatnik and you've mentioned a couple of times that you're aware of the Community board's request to city planning for neighborhood rezoning.
All were my first Community board meeting ever You know And we we'd be happy to support an area- wide rezoning and be the impetus for it in one way, shape or form.
So we're on block 1141 and here hold on You do not have to just give me a second I'm just going to read these off So. The total lot area is like about almost 80,000 feet.
Think that that's something we want to start to talk to you about and see what you're seeing in the neighborhood David has been working very closely with a real, an agent in the neighborhood who's, very active, with a lot of the people that are coming in to do business and are looking for these new modern buildings to do it.
That I would expect that the zoning boundary that DCP would want to see here would extend to to class and Avenue and take in that block face on class and Avenue, and you know, while I'm and I'm just Unfortunately, right now, as you mentioned, our only tool to accommodate something like that And the binding is the type of structure that we recently did with Grand and the grand Pacific rezoning Mike.
So I do not know if city planning would fall to go to class in or if it's something that you would desire to see up, but they would not be, and that's what I'm just throwing that out there so that you think that they're that they would be willing to just rezone the lots you control.
Other committee members with questions Just to clarify we're, not zoning, we're not voting on this rezoning application right now with this This is a pre euler, uniformly unused review.
We have people who are anxious to proceed as Eric opened up with saying it's been a while, since we've been looking at this process when we started this process, our current attorney general here, the position of council member for this district She was beating needing the bushes for money to do the environmental studies that would need to be done for a neighborhood rezoning, but I'm.
I would also say that the Tenant union membership, and also just a lot of people who you will talk to in the neighborhood, will tell you that part of the I guess when you're, when you're making decisions about the unit size, there's some concern that a lot of the housing that's being built in crown heights is not necessarily conducive to people trying to build roots in the community, build families, people who are intending to stay for the long term.
Age, income, restricted units, but all these things you're talking about, we think make for a better building and you'll meet a gentleman that we're working with who's, been studying the marketing for the building to understand it a little bit Now that we see, if we have a little bit of traction in it, we can start to pencil out what it's going to look like with the input of you and the person that we're working with and start to give you back.
The next person I'm going to represent in the next application is kind of an existing warehouse building down the block, , so I know, usually when you, when you submit a euler application, sometimes it's advantageous to try to get as much lots as you can.
Why we're having this conversation Everybody on this call is with the input of community of city planning, but I'm googling you right now to see exactly where 863 dean is That's a conversation for you and the board to have and tell me what you want to see.
The other thing if the board were also in favor of that, the second thing I would be interested in exploring with you Maybe this is a larger conversation for our housing committee as well as potentially others that might have interest, is the concept of potentially rent to own or low, affordable ownership programs for some of these units with 200 plus units in a building?
We, have precedent in our neighborhood and cba, with some of the projects on the buildings on St, Marks or Bergen Street that I think were developed for for ownership or affordable.
That's the impetus of this conversation today Is to kind of look at options and opportunities, and We'll look at what's been done in the city already And I'd like to engage and continue a conversation with you James on that point, and with each of you that have raised points- I was going to say: We will only succeed if you support us, so these ideas that you had with the restricting the use so that you do not have a dormitory type of use.
We'll start that discussion with HPD We're, going to be winding our way through city planning for a number of years.
I think I think it makes doing this type of a project for the community board more challenging, and the second comment I wanted to make was about affordable home ownership.
I do not know that maybe Mr Palatnik does from the Bronx, but the units that Mr Ellis mentioned on Bergen Street and Saint Mark's Avenue in Prospect heights were built long before MIH under in a time when there were a different set of subsidies, so I'm not sure how possible it is to apply other subsidies that are home ownership to lots that are rezoned under MIH, which I believe are required to have affordable rental.
Mr Polatnik is presenting in advance of a hearing which I think is coming up week after next, and he has one more item that he wanted to share with us in order to get some suggestions on how to improve it and his plan to go forward with a euler, so Mr Coney, I'm, just reminding you of that, and maybe you would want to let him finish the second proposal and then come back and do a overarching group of recommendations for both of them.
I just have a question that pulls the lens back a little bit as we're all reacting in real time to the new time frame that may be coming, up, M crown and as a land use committee member are we are we now considering the possibilities of taking individual applications?
But it is interesting that we've had these two presentations about what is effectively individual applications when we had worked carefully as a committee to hear over the last two years, or so that was not what was optimal for the neighborhood.
I think the community board would want to see a mix of apartment sizes for affordable.
However, I think that as a committee, knowing that now what we've decided we'd like to see as part of M crown if the applicant would want to make a proposal that would stay in line with what we're proposing.
Item, 875, St, Marks Avenue, the Crown Heights North, Historic district, the application to legalize workers referenced in the following in landmarks violations and they're enumerated in the materials in the invitation and who is present to speak on and present on 875 St marks.
Maybe I was going to be working with that, but whatever you think would be the best way to do.
I do not want to bore you with all the various details unless you really would like me to walk you through each one individually, but we were about to submit plans and we've been in contact with landmarks to try and rectify all these issues.
If landmarks is willing to accept some of the things that were done differently from what the original permit drawings portrayed and we're going through.
You can see we're asking landmarks: Let us keep the bays as they are not have to rebuild them with the very complex, stick, details and metal work and roofs, because it would be so onerous for the building to have to rip that all out at this point, as well as the fact is, we do not think it's that offensive.
Probably sixty percent of the work that was originally permitted and approved was done properly, but you still have these outliers like the bays and the mailbox and the glass blocks and things like and the front doors.
I am not going to take the time to repeat what was already said by Miss Tires and Mr Ellis, because I echo the same sentiments, but a couple of things that I take issue with, and one is to have someone come before us and ask for forgiveness and say how and speak to how it's not offensive to them.
I mean you have other homes on that block, who has maintained, My heart just breaks my heart to know what was done and again that's not before LPC, but I want to make sure that the owners are aware that historic preservation runs from the local level up to the federal level and when you look at the statues that govern historic preservation on all three levels, they all start out.
But since nobody in the building is talking to the folks in the community board to let them know, what's available, you're, struggling and floundering around and wasting a lot of money when the planning was not done out the gate Here, you are throwing good money after bad.
It took us forever and there was like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours on behalf of other two other owners who were going between landmarks and department of buildings, trying to find out the way for us to rectify these things.
I pride myself on being a very sensitive architect, who is also very concerned about historic preservation and that's why the clients asked me to come and represent them, because I've had worked with landmarks for 30 years and I've done very detailed.
So I want to hear from committee members Okay, I'm sitting here shaking my head, because I do not understand how people move in and if you look at all of the buildings on that block, they're, so beautiful.
Everyone, who spoke from the board, basically echoed my feelings over under around and through Miss young, from China Chronic North association made the point that the level of detail in these buildings, which you said you saw or I'm, not sure if you did the particularly the wainscoting, the parquet floors and then the stained glass, but I, viewed this house and the house is on this block from an entirely different perspective.
From the children's museum people who and the lady who spoke was one of the owners, they wanted to come into that block, because the houses were ornate and beautiful, but they never considered how they got to be that way, and it's just a total desecration.
People who have been put in this situation and the damage that has been done that have been done that are not up to code, was not our doing, and if we could go back in time and do it ourselves and make sure that it was done the right way, we absolutely would have, which is why we're hot I believe that there's a lack of information coming to you through the city agencies that you've been working, with, I'm, surprised and appalled that department of buildings did not tell you to seek the grants and tax credits that are available for for historic, preservation.
You know I, and the other thing that I want to add is that I think that we're we are open to listening.
I think we cleared our items and if you want to put off going to LPC for a hearing with a negative recommendation waiting in the wings and try to get some of this together and come back with a much shorter list of things, maybe it could be reconsidered, I'm, not sure, I can say for what the situation is now.
If people on the land use committee are available to attend the housing, committee, I think it will be very informative to some discussions that we may need to have going forward, and it would be great if people could attend that meeting.
Yes, awesome, I'm, going to let some people know who I think would like to know absolutely all about all of the Community board meetings are open, so please, come.
