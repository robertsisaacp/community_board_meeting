Good at it today, let's see okay, so there seems to have been some confusion on the house numbers for each site. What do we have here? 972 nope, I think 892 is first. Yes, it's a little confusing because there are two presentations, we're making and they're in different stages, but both very preliminary and they're on the same block and they're a block away from each other and they're different stories. So I think 892, the one I was able to successfully share is what was on your agenda first, if I'm not mistaken. Okay, please proceed okay. So the very first thing I want to say is thank you for making the time for all of us. It's an absolute pleasure to see the leadership that's been taken on at the community level throughout the city for the last seven or eight months, and that continues to go on and your community board has been no different in that respect. It's really been impressive and thank you for making the time I've watched big agencies in the city struggle, while the community boards seem to have gotten their act together, which is very impressive, and thank you for making the time. My name is Eric Palatnik, and I am here, I know a lot of people I saw on the call that I recognize, and I'm here on behalf of David, Chen and David, is on the call as well and Raymond. Chan is his architect to discuss with you a proposal. It's not a Europe application, yet we hope it would be. We recognize that there's been a lot going on in your neighborhood and and that we're coming in after a lot of things have happened around what we're asking you to do, but I'm here to tell you that you, many of you know me for two decades and David is a different type of developer than most. He did not start off to be a developer. It was a it's a happy accident and he's been in the neighborhood for years decades as a business person and he's anxious to explore and accommodate any creative ideas to create something here. So he's coming to you right now, recognizing that there are very specific desires and goals and asks that people may want to see and that there's a history that we're in the middle of- and we do not need to be disrespectful of that by asking you we're hoping actually that we could take it to the next step and to create what you've already done, because I met ethel just before I've known her for years, but we met just before the pandemic and she introduced me to what you've been doing with your restrictive decorations and the Rfa, and I found that to be very creative because it's a problem. I've been confronting in land use applications all over. The city is a way to accommodate everybody's desires, and I was very impressed that that's what you've done. So that is the backdrop. That's how we're coming to you. My name is Eric Palatnik and we're here in a preliminary fashion. David owns the site, so you see there labeled site, it's of course, on the bergen. You know you can see the location of it. It's between Bergen Grand and you all know that it's adjacent to a residential district along Classen Avenue. It's a conglomeration of properties that are identified here. The bill, the businesses that are in place, one is David's, which is an import export business. The other ones are a party rental business and a restaurant, a food restaurant supply. You can imagine, excuse me for a second eric. Can you put your screen in presentation mode, and I would ask Miss George or Ms Neil to set people who are joining the meeting to mute on entry, so we do not think beeping and the clicking for everyone who's joining that they come in and whoever's typing. If we could get that noise quieted well, please proceed Mr, Palatna, okay. I hope that helped. I do not know what presentation mode is, but I made it bigger. So I hope that's okay, I'll work on I'll learn about presentation mode after the after I, okay appreciate it. Thank you all know the neighborhood better than I you know that we are in a manufacturing. Zoning district and right across the street, to the north of the south of us on Bergen is, of course, a residential district, and you can see that there's a school in the yard in the residential buildings, and you know that I'll scroll through what we're asking you permission to build I'll, get to the end of it. So you could see and then I'll back into the proposal sit back into the presentation. Give the computer a second. What we're asking you to? Let us build is this two buildings which would be one? Let me get to a good picture here for you here. Okay, you should be able to see that showing you two buildings, the top portion is the portion before that, I'm showing you on bergen. The bottom portion is on Dean. The thinner portion is the excuse me. The thinner portion is on Bergen. The thicker portion is on Dean. I get a little mixed up. It's proposed to construct or allow for an R7A Mx district that you can see right there in the middle. It says: roof over one story: commercial light, manufacturing, we've of course been students what you've been doing in the neighborhood and what you're the uses that you're trying to attract and we're committed to try to do that. The buildings you can see here proposed to be seven stories in height, again, recognizing and reading and learning and studying what you've been doing in the neighborhood with a limit of nine stories. So we came in at seven stories, but it's 85 feet because we are providing a very decent first floor spill in a second that would accommodate. Of course, the restricted floor area uses this screen here. If I could scroll over a little bit, let me get the whole thing on there, for you shows you the building sort of in a it does show you a cross section, and this shows you the buildings on each side of the would be one, of course, would be on Dean Street. That would be a wider building. Justine Street has 445 feet of frontage up the property on Bergen Street has has less frontage, and that would be thinner in size, but the end result would be they would share a common ground floor that would go through the block, so when he got inside it would go right through. So it really gives a nice big floor. Plate gives a nice big, open area for people to work and get things done, and I think achieve a lot of the uses that you're trying to see attracted, I think, could fit nicely in a space like this 23 foot high ceiling heights and then above it. Of course we have the requested residential if it were to be approved- and I know it's a big if it would create a substantial number of units, the total number of units would be 274., 69 of which would be affordable, and I have not even explored with David who's, the owner working, maybe with different programs at HPD, because everybody in the city, who's in housing, should be thrilled. That HPD restored quite a few bucks to their budget last week and that opens up a lot of opportunities for more affordable housing. We're committed to a deep affordability level. If you ever have somebody come in front of you that tells you they do not make money off of affordability the deep affordability level option. One is what in fact does create actually a more value for a property owner, believe it or not, they do better. They make more money, so they're we're happy to come in with the am the MIH program, with a with a higher level of affordability, we're happy to explore different creative ideas to add even more affordability to it. Recognizing that we are still, of course, have to substantiate an investment. If you would even let us build it up, but that's basically the overview to what we're asking you for the rest of the presentation takes you through the neighborhood, which you probably know better than I do, but I'll give you just two minutes of the maps, so you can see the maps at least and understand what we're asking you for and then I could show you what we've learned and what you already know to be the case of the buildings around you that have been rezoned or the properties. I should say, can you can you just repeat the proposed number of affordable units? Yeah 69 is the number of affordable units and again we have. We have a cheat sheet. We could share with you after the hearing and we we're taking notes also. So, if you're making yourself mashugana getting all the information, we have everything written down and we can provide more in writing afterwards, so that you do not have to keep track. If I tend to talk like the the guy in the fedex commercial years ago. So with that is the backdrop. These are the maps that we're asking you to change. The left side is the existing. The right side is the proposed, and you can see there right in the middle, where it says Dean Street, on the left. You could see that our property is m11. It says it right in the middle between Dean and Bergen, and the right side is the same map and instead of saying m11, it says m14, slash, R7A, you'll notice on that map. Of course, to the diagonal to the right is the other rezoning that I just spoke about Pacific, which created the cba that I'm very impressed with up, which is you know better than I do it's creating the Mx district, which is what we're modeling ourselves after, because we're watching what you're doing and we're hoping you'll. Let us do the same thing. David is anxious to do this because it's not easy to make a buck there. It was not easy to make a buck with the properties before this happened and it's harder now for him. His import export business. Things have really shifted. Everything has moved over to Kennedy Airport people there's a lot more distribution going on over there and he needs to be closer to airports and for the other businesses that are nearby that he's got in the in the spaces. These people are really not in the right spot for what they're doing and everybody that's involved with. This is telling David that either they'd be happy to keep some of the space in where they are right now, if he gets the approval, because the Mx Allows Board, but they're also happy to relocate because it's they're there by happenstance, not because it's necessarily the ideal location for anybody. None of these businesses need to be there and they do not employ that many people they're mostly distribution companies, which involve truckers and a couple of people driving forklifts they're, not really jobs. I think that I would be after- and I do not think you're after, but having said that, we'll keep going, and I would love to hear your opinions. This map is a great map, because you know it's recognizing. What's going on around us, it recognizes what you've re- zoned. You can see it in the in the peach color and you can see it in the purplish color what's on in the past and what you created. These are just in the last couple of years. I know you worked really hard. I read about everything I saw some of the hearings and I spoken to people and I know you're trying to create something- and I can't emphasize enough we're here to recognize that and try to create something with you. This just gives you the idea of what you've created, but for those who are not aware of it, showing you the the idea of the M crown concepts and maps and things that have been created by you that have set a framework for what we're all trying to do. We've all watched what you've done for decades, we've all been a student of what you've been doing. I can't say it enough because your neighborhood is such a critical neighborhood, I think, to New York City and has is it is so blossoming and continues to blossom every year and- and I respect what you're trying to do. I know you've held a close view of your community through the years to make sure that what gets created is within your vision. So this map is a nod to that to try to show you how we are not ignoring your vision and hopefully we're settling in with it to some extent and the rest of the maps. Just give you, you know technical maps of tax maps and whatnot. So that's the application I'll just leave it on some pictures. Maybe I'll go up to I'll. Let's see if I can find some pictures for you. I know we had some in the beginning, maybe go through that for a second started, the pictures just to refresh everybody's memories. If you have not been out for a walk on the block, it's not the best, looking block in New York City, and I say that with a lot of love. I do not. I do not own any property, but you can see if you won on the right side. What David owns is really a vestige of years gone by. Obviously there were you know the building in the middle of the taller building was created for something I do not even know the history of it. You probably do, but that's the property on the right hand, side. The view on the left is across the street on the right side of the pages across the street view four here in the top left. It shows you a clearer picture of the site. Excuse me, David does his best to keep it clean, you can see. It's got. New sidewalks in place. Roll down gates are in good order, the brickwork he tries to maintain it and point it. You can see he's patched and fixed where he can the graffiti blossoms as it does, and he tries to cover it up as soon as it comes up and then comes up again, but he does his best. It's the other lot. You can see it it's in good shape and it's a newer building across the street. Of course you have the ironically, I mean you're talking about diabetes and dialysis center across the street, and my condolences are my sympathies to the person in the family that you mentioned earlier, and here's more images. The next few shots will take you around the corner and take you over to Bergen Street, which you know better than anybody is in other world left in the right side. North and south side of Bergen Street is literally the dividing line and has been for a while. Hopefully we can do something that helps encourage something that you want to see there and view. 18 is my favorite picture of all, because in the middle of everything I just showed you that's a real urban condition. You've got a beautiful, beautiful piece of land. That's been like that. As far as I can remember back, I think, 30 years it struck me as being there, as I'm sure it's been there longer. That is our what we are asking you to do. We have not we're here to hear your opinions, your thoughts, we've met with city planning. We've only met with city planning to make sure it was something that they might be going along with, but we have not gone any further than meet with them. That's why we come to you now, so we have not done anything we're here tonight with open ears, and hopefully we can start a conversation. So that's my presentation and thank you for giving us the time to talk about it. Thank you. Mr Palatnik and you've mentioned a couple of times that you're aware of the Community board's request to city planning for neighborhood rezoning. Was that discussed in your meeting with city planning that was not discussed in my meeting with city planning, primarily because it was sort of the proverbial elephant in the room. They did not bring it up that it was something they were doing and I started with hair years ago. You all were my first Community board meeting ever and- and this discussion has been going on since I started so- and you've all lived there longer than I've been practicing, which is 25 years already, so I did not bring it up. Winston Von Engel did not introduce it, nor did his staff. You know and we we'd be happy to support an area- wide rezoning and be the impetus for it in one way, shape or form. It's we're not opposed to that to being involved with you and teaming with you, we're happy to be to be involved in a discussion. Okay, so I need to find out if any of the committee members have questions on your project committee members, do we have any questions for Mr Polatnik? While we have him, you want to put your questions in the chat. I thought I have a couple questions. If we have time. I know this is Mr Viconi and I was waiting to hear your questions. Please proceed. First question is: I just want to make sure that I understand all the lots that are involved here, yeah, so we're on block 1141 and here hold on I'll, make it easier for you I'll get to the map. So you do not have to just give me a second I'm not yeah. This one shows it as good as anybody here. Okay, so I think let me I'm just going to read these off and you tell me if I'm missing anything we're talking about lots: 28, 33, 37, 38, 39, 40., no 40., no 40s, not there, okay, 61 and 59 bingo, okay, great, so you have a total. So the total lot area is like about almost 80,000 feet. I wrote it down beforehand. Now I can no it's 40,645. How much it's well, the read. Let me let me explain, hold on one second. The lot area is different from the rezoning area, so this is the site. So let me scroll up what you're looking at right here. Is this lot area? Okay, so this lot area this lot area is the ten thousand square foot a lot. Eleven thousand square foot lot, yeah. Forty thousand forty thousand six hundred and forty five square feet. Are these lots for that? I just added up all of the numbers on all of the square footage on oasis and I got a number that's a lot bigger than forty thousand. Maybe the architect can clarify for me. I apologize. Let me double check my zoning analysis and see if I'm reading something wrong. So, for instance, I get lot. 28 is like 35,556.. Lab 33 is 25,480.. Those are I mean, there's some pretty good- sized lots raymond Chan if you're on the phone. Maybe you can help me out, because I'm reading your zoning analysis and I see with well fifty- four- I'm sorry, I'm wrong, never mind forget it. I picked the wrong number you're right and I'm wrong. Okay, that's! Okay! I'll! Take that I was like yeah. I just wanted to get to the total to the total lot area here, 40,000 I did the math beforehand. I just lost that number again: 40,645 yep. Okay, now we're in agreement; okay, so and you're going to and you're going to have total coverage at the first floor. Yeah, okay and have you thought of I mean, as you know, the community board has is looking for is looking for restricted uses for promotion of the M crown the impound uses that it deems to be job. Creating. What have you given any thought to what percentage of the ground floor you're proposing to dedicate to those uses? Well, I understand that we're restricted to 25, but we've talked about it and given what is in the building right now and what David is trying to create here, I think we could even do better than the 25 use, because I mean he's pretty consistent with some of the businesses that are there now with the 25 and he'd like to expand on that. So I think that that's something we want to start to talk to you about and see what you're seeing in the neighborhood what's growing, I know David has been working very closely with a real, an agent in the neighborhood who's, very active, with a lot of the people that are coming in to do business and are looking for these new modern buildings to do it in with big floor- to- ceiling heights, clear, spans, well, ventilated, well-, lit seller space for storage, that kind of stuff so and David is he's on the phone. Now that's his roots he's he came to America he's an immigrant originally and he came here and built his business and he bought this property with the division of building his business, not with developing it. He never thought he would be on this call right now. That was not in the game plan 25 years ago when he started, so that's the spirit of the development. So I guess I do not know your role we've never met before, but if you're involved in these businesses we'd like to talk to you more, I guess: okay and you're and you're seeking you you're planning on seeking an Mx with m14 and R7A. Is that is that correct? Yes, okay, okay, I'm sorry! Once again you said the total number of units of residential units. You have the total residential, that's just penciled out now, because this is just you've seen the plans level. It could probably accommodate about 274. seven stories tall about 274 units. So it's a lot of units can get can get built with a lot of affordable units. I mean nearly 70, affordable units and again what is the average size of the 274 units? You're, anticipating the average? Did you do any sort of calculations on your unit density? When you came up with these numbers, or did you just you know, I'm looking here number of units, it's raymond yeah we actually using the zoning code right now, which is a 680 square foot per per unit, so some unit will be bigger. Some universities, smaller, but averaging now is about 680.. The better number might be feed on the to go with because that number on the units the we have not really flushed it out, because I do not know what your desires are. You know sometimes they'll go into community and they'll say they want to see more larger units and they want to see some more smaller units. That's part of this conversation, but just you know, there's a hundred and nearly 190,000 square feet of floor area available. Excuse me of residential fluorite yeah 186,000 square feet of residential floor area, so we have floor area to create most configurations that you would want to see of the unit mixes. Okay, please, so you have other questions, go ahead. Well, you know it's kind of preliminary, but I mean one of the things I want to highlight that I that I think we'd have to think about in supporting something like this is that I would expect that the zoning boundary that DCP would want to see here would extend to to class and Avenue and take in that block face on class and Avenue, and you know, while I'm and I'm just I'm just thinking out loud here I mean what that would do. Is you know the idea that we could get that you're interested in accommodating the M crown uses on the on the ground? Floor is good. Unfortunately, right now, as you mentioned, our only tool to accommodate something like that and the binding is the type of structure that we recently did with Grand and the grand Pacific rezoning Mike. My concern here is that I think your zoning boundary would end up extending to class and out and we would have no mechanism to get the same type of commitment from other from the other properties around you, and I just I just think we'll have to think about that. I mean you know you had mentioned you're, potentially interested in going above what we have sought in terms of use restrictions, and maybe you know we would be more comfortable. I do not know, I mean it might be possible for us to get more into your building to make up for what we would not get in the other sites that were that would be taken into your rezoning. That's just a thought, and I'm glad you said that, and let me just toss one idea back at you, which is, I do not know, what's driving the thought that we would have to go to class and because, as I mentioned, when we did sit with city planning, we met with them before you, and this is the map that came out of that. So I do not know if city planning would fall to go to class in or if it's something that you would desire to see up, but they would not be, and that's what I'm just throwing that out there so that you think that they're that they would be willing to just rezone the lots you control yeah. We talked about that for a little while during our meeting with them. That was what, unfortunately, for ethel. They did not speak about your desire to reason on the entire neighborhood, but they did speak about where they wanted to draw the lines here, so that this was done with their input. So if your concern is that they might force me to bring the line to class- and that might not be the case- maybe they just did not realize it. When we spoke the first time or maybe it did not, you know maybe they'll rethink it, because that happens sometimes when it goes through other people. But as of now this is what we've created. That's it's been our experience with the other rezonings in the zone, but yeah. No, I see your map, and so it looks like you're going to so it looks like that map goes beyond lots that you control, but not onto the lots on class and avenue. For the most part. I get a little messy in my in my calculations here, but it's it does over we're. Not we do not have 400 feet on the on the Bergen Street side hold on. Let me just you know. We only have on dean on both sides. We have. We have 95 feet on the Bergen Street side and we have 275 feet on the Dean Street side. So you can see here the map extends further. So I do not know if we did. I was trying to study this before, because I thought you might ask this. I do not think we did an overlay map that shows you what's in and what's out on this map, we could really help you, but that was part of the discussion with city planning. I remember getting to the this width of 445 and 400., so would take in other lots that do not include just hours right and I'll. Get you more I'll. Get you more clarity on that, so you can see it now that I see what you know what you're trying to focus on yeah. It looks like a map right I mean it looks I yeah. I have to guess, because the map does not show the lots, but it looks to me like it probably goes to it goes. It goes to the lots that front class and Avenue, but does not include them right now. So it looks like there's a couple: the lots, the other lots, would be lots to the east that you do not control. I think that it looks like it's drawn around the lot on the west. It looks like it's drawn along the lots. You control yes, Eric. Do you mind if I say something real quick? Oh please, Austin I was about to mention. Austin is in addition to being described the cartographer. He wears a few hats, so go on Austin yeah. No, I just was going to say that if you go to the photographs page any of them, you can see a bit more of what the project area would be. I know that the lot numbers are not on the key map, but you can at least see that section okay, so this map right Eric. So we could probably do what we did for Monitor Street, where we like put the labels on the lots or something we could do that yeah. If you could do that and match them with photos, maybe go with a photo of each lot. So we can give it back to Vic that sort of yeah really. So I I'm looking at right now, I'm looking at page 21 of your deck and your lots are outlined in red in a broken red line, and it looks to me, like the lots to the East- are part of the zoning map that, but they do not go up to class, and you see what I'm saying yeah. So we usually outline in red with the red dash line, because that's what DCP, so it looks like it looks like your zoning area would take in lots, 40, 41, 56, 55, 57 and 58, which are on Bergen Street and Dean Street, but not Class and Avenue. So I think that's yeah. From our end. It's definitely that's definitely worth a conversation with with city planning, but okay. I understand, I think, just to confirm that, but I think I understand what the intention is all right and by the way I use dyslexic. A moment ago, I told you Vic, I mixed up Gibb and Viconi. I apologize all right. I've been called worse. I apologize other committee members with questions yeah, just to clarify we're, not zoning, we're not voting on this rezoning application right now with this is just a preliminary discussion. Yes, this is a pre euler, uniformly unused review procedure, discussion! Okay, as you as you, I'm pretty sure. You recall that we have the M crown proposal on hold for lack of budget funding and unfortunately, we have people who are anxious to proceed as Eric opened up with saying it's been a while, since we've been looking at this process when we started this process, our current attorney general here the position of council member for this district and she was- she was beating needing the bushes for money to do the environmental studies that would need to be done for a neighborhood rezoning, but I'm taking up your question time once you finish with your question, get an answer. I want to ask Mr Klotnick about the environmental environmentals that would be required for his process. What was there before in particular, but go ahead? Mr Laser! Thank you yeah thanks. So I am a member of the Community Board, but also a member of the cronies, tenant union and I'm a tenant, and so I am very glad that you mentioned that the MIH option, you're focusing on is option one, the deep affordability option yeah. So I guess I do not know if this is so much well. I do have a question about you know the expected affordability of the other units that would be likely to be built, but definitely, I would say there would be more support for the deeper affordability right. Just as you said yeah, and I guess I would also say that the Tenant union membership and also just a lot of people who you will talk to in the neighborhood, will tell you that part of the I guess when you're, when you're making decisions about the unit size, there's some concern that a lot of the housing that's being built in crown heights is not necessarily conducive to people trying to build roots in the community, build families, people who are intending to stay for the long term, so the more that the units built can be of the type that you know that people could envisage living in for a very long time would be. You would get a more positive reaction with those you know. I'm glad you said that, because what we've been doing, I've been doing this, for, as I said, a long time, and we know that, in order for buildings to be successful, just the building has to be able to accommodate people at various stages of their life. So I think what you you've witnessed and what you've seen is probably smaller units. I think that do not let a family grow in place, because a lot of these apartments are families that are coming into place or they're not built for seniors, which is another opportunity when you talk about. I do not know how much you're trying to accommodate affordability for seniors, but the city offers an errors program which is, which is a very good program to explore that we could talk about that offers. Age, income restricted units, but all these things you're talking about, we think make for a better building and you'll meet a gentleman that we're working with who's, been studying the marketing for the building to understand it a little bit and now that we see if we have a little bit of traction in it, we can start to pencil out what it's going to look like with the input of you and the person that we're working with and start to give you back some numbers. You can start to see what things are going to cost we'll have a better understanding of what we're going to be able to build, and then we can figure out what it's going to cost. So we could get to that point with you and include you in the conversation of course. Ultimately, the market rate apartments are going to be market rate. I mean that's the nature of market, but I think what we can really control is the affordability component and give you an estimate or a guesstimate of where the market requirements are going to be. We are building and what I keep trying to say. We're building for the neighborhood we are not trying to create something that is not a product for the community, especially in light of Covid-19. We think that people are staying where they are and they want homes and they want those homes comfortable, and we do not bet on a migratory pattern. I think they used to see in the past as much. So that's what we're coming to this with in that attitude. So thanks for your thanks for your input, Sarah have a question: yes, who's speaking, please yeah, I'm Albert Appleton! Please proceed yeah! You said that the M crown was on hold for lack of funding. Yes, okay, so we do not have any idea of like when that would start to commence again right, like maybe next year, like end of next year or 2022, do we have any type of lead on that? I think we're looking at fiscal year, 22, I'm not sure. Okay and my next question is you mentioned that you were submitting a euler epic, a ulef application. I notice on the tabs on the screen. I see 892 Dean Street, I see 922. I see 972 and 974. Are you submitting a euler application for multiple lots? No, it's a big coincidence. What happened is right after David called me. The next person I'm going to represent in the next application is kind of an existing warehouse building down the block, Mr Jefferson's on the phone with us right now. He called me so ironically, they both called me within like weeks of each other, and you know so we're and they're, both at the same exact stage where they're both sitting with these properties for years, and they do not know what to do so. That's why you're seeing them both I'm glad. That's all I had up there and I did not have anything else up on the screen. Okay right so like the reason why, like the reason why I asked that is because I'm the owner of 863 Dean Street right, so I know usually when you, when you submit a euler application, sometimes it's advantageous to try to get as much lots as you can. Would it be to our advantage to add more to make the ulef application more feasible to actually go through, and you know if we added like another lot to the application like 860., you know, that's why we're here? That's why we're having this conversation and I'm not the guy, really that just got that makes that decision. Everybody on this call is with the input of community of city planning, but I'm googling you right now to see exactly where 863 dean is and that's a conversation for you and the board to have and tell me what you want to see. Let me see I'm getting my bearings here for a second, yes you're, literally right next door. So right so if I go hold on across the street right yeah you're on the other side of the street, so it would not be contagious across the street. Oh, it would not be contained. Okay, it's the whole different yeah another. It's a whole nother can of worms, but that's the problem that the board has been talking about, and I think that's what they've you've all been grappling with for years is to try to do it comprehensively and that's the point you're raising is that if you own that piece across the street you're probably struggling, let me see if I can get a picture. You're probably struggling like everybody else, is over there yeah right all right. This is everybody can't talk at once. We have seen this rezonings where people where the sites are included across the street, but that's not here or there. I believe Mr Ellis has something to add to this discussion. Please go ahead. Yes, just one concern I have in requesting any large format. Apartments is the trend that we've seen somewhat, especially in crown heights is developing our redeveloping buildings to include. I forget what the term is almost like: dormitory style living where it's three or four bedroom units and they're multiple leaseholders would be in that same unit. I think what Miss Lazar was speaking about larger format. Apartments to accommodate families and growth is really a an interest, is of interest to myself, especially and probably many others, to help families in the neighborhood instead of small format units. But the concern I have is if it's designed to have multiple large format units the con that the idea of them not being kind of dormitoried out with multiple leaseholders per unit is something I want to make sure, because that then itself leads to the same concern that we have that they're, not investing community members and there's a lot of turnover and low investment in the community well- being with those type of tenants, so flagging that Mr blackness as something that we would want to make sure that would not be the stop somebody tapping on the window. I do not know where I'm sorry Ms Tyus Miss Tyus. Yes, you are audible to the rest of us. I'm sorry, I apologize okay, so that was one thing I wanted to just flag, Mr Platnick, that we might want to just continue seeing ways to address and prevent that from happening. The other thing if the board were also in favor of that the second thing I would be interested in exploring with you and I'm not very familiar with this- and maybe this is a larger conversation for our housing committee as well as potentially others that might have interest, is the concept of potentially rent to own or low, affordable ownership programs for some of these units with 200 plus units in a building? Can some of them not be potentially in a route for ownership, opportunities or contracts? You, like unicorns, that's only happened once in New, York City. So far, it's happened in the Bronx and it was a hell of a lift for them. But well do not. We have do not. We have precedent in our neighborhood and cba, with some of the projects on the buildings on St, Marks or Bergen Street that I think were developed for for ownership or affordable. Are you talking about St, Mary's, Hospital, further west and close between closer to Prospect heights? I do not remember it might be between it's happened once I I'm all game for that. I believe in that. I think the affordability is focused when it's rental. I think the only way to really bring people up in society is to give them a chance to own their home, and just renting is renting. I mean I do not care if you're, renting, affordable, you're, renting market rate you're still renting and not to do anything wrong with being a renter. But if you, if you want to own, you need your colleagues that you're representing to explore. Maybe a possibility of that way. If that's the impetus of this conversation today is to kind of look at options and opportunities, and things like that, then maybe there's a chance that this large building, I mean this large footprint that you're speaking of, could potentially accommodate something as unique and unicorny as what we're talking about yeah, listen, it might be able to- and this is it's a big project. It's a big development and it's got an opportunity, and I agree with you. So I said that at the beginning- and I meant it so we'll I will explore it- we'll look at what's been done in the city already and I'd like to engage and continue a conversation with you James on that point, and with each of you that have raised points- and you know like I said, we'll only be successful, I can't hear it's distracting over Mr Platnick. Sorry. Can you say that again, Mr Blatnick? I was going to say: we will only succeed if you support us, so these ideas that you had with the restricting the use so that you do not have a dormitory type of use. You know we're all for that. That's not what we're after here and if we can create an affordable program that does have a home ownership component. We'll start that discussion with HPD we're going to be winding our way through city planning for a number of years, so we've got some time to sit and talk with HPD and we're happy to do that and you carry a lot of clout because this goes back to the beginning and I'm not I'm not blowing smoke up. You up all of you should know the restrictive declarations that you're willing to create are groundbreaking because they allow a developer to figure out what they can do and they can agree to with to you and you can get what you want. So everything you're saying right now. If we study it and it makes sense for us we're on board with it also and we're happy to memorialize it the way you want to work, there would be nothing more spectacular than being one of the first pioneers and you know of doing such a thing and creating a model that makes sense and is profitable for both developers and all that stuff. So I challenge you that Mr Platnick and your team- and I will now give back who else on the land Use committee has questions and if none we'll go on to the next, I'm sorry, I wanted to just jump in with a couple of responses: yeah Mr Kim. Can I just I just want to say there was a chat. There was a question in the Chat Miss Tyus as well that you need to address. I'm sorry, I know at least one building on Washington Avenue, that's a rent to own. That's from Sarah, okay, you have! Ms, do you have a house number for that building on Washington? It's not our community. As far as I know. No, I do not think I had a question. I think the it was higher up in the chat that somebody had a question. Maybe it was Tasha Young's question, I'm not seeing this. I could read it out. The question from Tasha Young was hello, everyone who are you working with to market deep, affordable housing and that's Tasha from Laurie Cumbo's office. Thank you body. We have not teamed up with anybody yet thank you, Tasha for asking us until Councilwoman combo. We all thanked her because she's, of course doing a great job leading everybody. We do not have an affordable partner. Yet we're happy to start that conversation. We were going to come to your office next after we spoke with the community board because we did not want to put you in the awkward position of seeing something before the Community board saw it. So we would love to come and sit with you if that's okay and go through things with you. Thank you. Mr Palatnik appreciate that Ms Young. Do you have any other questions for Mr Palatnik and then we'll go to Mr Viconi after Ms Young asks the questions you can unmute yourself. Can she unmute herself alright good evening? Can you can you hear me remember she had to leave at seven so she's, not on the call anymore? Okay, thank you all right now. I think it's tony and then there was someone speaking who is that speaking. This is lucian Allen, also from majority leader, Combo's office, okay, so you're speaking for mission go ahead. Yes, I'm sorry and you if she did not have any other questions besides that, but I did I was hoping to get a copy of the presentation. If this is possible just so, we can have it for our records yeah. Definitely after this meeting we will actually reach out to you to maybe ask for another call with you if with your office, if that's, okay and yeah, we'll also send over to your copy of the presentation. Definitely, okay, so that sounds great. Thank you. Thank you. So I think Mr Viconi is next yeah, so I wanted to make two comments and then a suggestion. The first, the first comment regards trying to get other lots into this rezoning. I think doing that presents challenges for the community board in this context, unless all of the owners are interested in making the same kinds of commitments for restricted use, we had a little bit of an experience with that on grand Pacific, where we tried to bring other owners and it was difficult and it ultimately did not work out. So I think that, right now, my it's not it's possible to do, but I think it makes. I think I think it makes doing this type of a project for the community board more challenging, and the second comment I wanted to make was about affordable home ownership. I do not. I do not know that to be compatible with MIH. I do not know there to be any MIH options that support home ownership. It might be possible, but I do not. I do not know that maybe Mr Palatnik does from the Bronx, but the units that Mr Ellis mentioned on Bergen Street and Saint Mark's Avenue in Prospect heights were built long before MIH under in a time when there were a different set of subsidies, so I'm not sure how possible it is to apply other subsidies that are home ownership to lots that are rezoned under MIH, which I believe are required to have affordable rental units. So now I want to make a suggestion. Since it sounds like more, there were not more questions to be asked. I would like to suggest gib. This is Kathy island. Could I could I make a ask a question. I do not have a camera. I apologize for interrupting you. Can I just finish what I was saying, though there were no more questions, but yes, I'm happy to wait. Thank you. Well, why do not you go ahead? I'll make my suggestion after you're finished. Okay audience. I want everybody to recognize that this is not a regulatory item which we do have on tonight's agenda. Mr Polatnik is presenting in advance of a hearing which I think is coming up week after next, and he has one more item that he wanted to share with us in order to get some suggestions on how to improve it and his plan to go forward with a euler, so Mr Coney, I'm just reminding you of that, and maybe you would want to let him finish the second proposal and then come back and do a overarching group of recommendations for both of them. Okay, that's fine! All right! So would you like me to present the other one? Would it be appropriate to have Kathy ask her a question. I I'm not sure what happened that is that is Miss Tyler's, stolen yeah, but Mrs Lynn. Can you wait and hear the second item and then ask a question for both of them? Yes, I can thank you. Thank you. Please go ahead. Mr Palatnik! This is much quicker and shorter. You know the block better than I do. The former studebaker building that was, I think it was or recently sold by work is on the left. This is to the to the east of us a couple of blocks yeah. Obviously you can see class in there on the right side. Bergen above you, the owner, is on the phone with us right now. You heard them earlier. It's Oswald, jeffers and Florian phillips they've, been community members for years, have lived in the community and work in the community, and this building was, I think, a former dairy and is now a warehouse for storage. It rests across the street from a site that you recently rezoned, that's in the lower right corner and I'll show you that in a second and it rests next door to a building that years ago, you granted a variance to when I represented them and the one of the people who owned it died and they never acted on it and that's the building to the right and you're granted a variance to allow for residential, and that has since expired. The owners of this building are on the phone with you right now, they've really struggled with the building for years. The same story always here. This is a tougher situation than the last proposal. I was presenting to you in the sense that it does not create it does not take up that much area, it's just one. Building with a footprint of 54 by a hundred, it may be better suited for a variance than a rezoning, but we brought it we're bringing it in front of you right now, and I appreciate the time simply to present it to you, because Mr Jeffers and Mr Phillips would enjoy the chance to redevelop it with something productive. Then, if it can't be that it's for residential, maybe it could be from to add more commercial space onto the building they're in an m11 zone with only a one, far allowed. The building is built to a 2.8 now, but maybe if they were able to go up, you know three stories on top up and they could build some type of viable office or M crown type of uses like you see next door. But that's why we're coming to you? We just wanted to have a conversation. We recognize your time is tight and thank you and I'll just show you here. You know the block better than I do so I'll, just scroll down and I'll pause it right here and that's our conversation really. I gave you a whole presentation, but I do not think I need to show you much more than this, so this could be a little bit of a brief conversation. I do not want to monopolize your evening, but we were hoping to get your thoughts see if you had any thoughts to this block or what you'd like to see there. We do not have plans created. They have not done anything. Yet it's really very preliminary. That's it any questions on 972,974 Dean Street! Well, this has been. This is Kathy island. May I ask my question now? Yes, please go ahead. Okay, thank you! So much and thank you for the presentations. I just have a question that pulls the lens back a little bit as we're all reacting in real time to the new time frame that may be coming up, M crown and as a land use committee member are we are we now considering the possibilities of taking individual applications? We have not had a time to discuss this as a committee with the different timing for Mground, and I understand that this is news that we're all processing together, but it is interesting that we've had these two presentations about what is effectively individual applications when we had worked carefully as a committee to hear over the last two years, or so that was not what was optimal for the neighborhood. That's my question. Thank you. I do believe that we had some of meetings with city planning discussing the cutback in the budget and they are still in the process of doing community outreach. In fact, we have dates coming up where they're proceeding with this community Outreach Forum Crown, under the assumption that it will eventually be funded but they're not sure now and their excuse for entertaining private applications. As we go through this period of unconfirmed funding, I think we have two meetings coming up the dates slip away from me now, the early December miss George. Do you have those dates on your calendar? One's December, 14th I'll, get the other one for you, okay, so we do have those coming up. Kathy and everything is a toss- up, and I did want to close out on these two presentations by reminding private applicants that to build to the maximum roi that they'd be seeking, they will be planting their feet on ground infrastructure that is likely not going to accommodate what they want to build to the maximum that they may want to build to. So that's the utilities and the city- owned infrastructure. It's not going to be ready, so we're at we're in a conundrum where inputs and outputs from every angle that would provide required infrastructure for a new neighborhood to rise is not going to be in place. So for these private applicants I would ask that they wait. It's been a long wait, they're going to have to bear the brunt of the cleanup, which is one of the things that's holding back him crown to do the study and then the cleanup we're talking a couple million dollars out of six coffers for this. What a eight block area! So that's one thing so Ms Island! If you do not have another question, I'm going to close out with Mr Ricconi comments. Unless there are other one or two other comments from committee members, Ms Island, do you have anything else? You want to add to this? No thank you. I just think it's an important frame of reference as we listen to these applicants. Thank you very much. You're welcome Mr Ficoni. Do you have a closing statement? Well, actually I have a question about yes, I do, but before I get to that, I have a question about this property: the 972 dean property. This is a four- story. Building that already is you know, as Mr Palatnik pointed out, has floor area above above, what's allowed under the zoning. So it's you know it's non- conforming and grandfathered, and I guess my question is: why is this building not possible to be adaptively reused to have to have some productive uses in it I mean we have buildings in the M Crown zone that are only one far or vacant lots and those can be uneconomical, but this is not that's not the case with this building. What what's preventing this from being used in an economical way? It's there's nothing that severely restricting its economics other than the substantial risk that needs to be taken on its redevelopment and it's possible that they might be able to make it work, but it would be more helpful if they were able to get potentially another floor or two on, even for the permitted use to give them more comfort in taking that risk, so that that's where they were coming to. So this proposal is different than the other one in the sense that it's either residential or commercial. They just wanted to talk about they've done the numbers on creating it's not big enough to take the risk that was taken next door on creating that type of office building, and it's not small enough that it's a small investment. You know so it's in this grayish area. So that's why that's why it's occurred with the presentation, because we do not have a set idea: we're not pleading poverty. We're not saying that! There's a big problem necessarily other than you know. What point does the owner take the risk, and this is emblematic of the community of going into a business decision on it. As opposed to the storage that he's doing now, which is you know the relatively lowest use he could possibly have there, I think okay, I understand so here. I guess this is what I this is what I would like to kind of propose as a next step. First of all, to take to Kathy's point, you know the euler process is open to any applicant and the Department of City planning, if they get an application from these from these owners, will move it through the process and the community board is part of that process. So it's really at the stage when we're reviewing a ulerp application that you know we decide if it's something that we can support or not I mean, I think, that's really the. I think that's really the time that happens, and I think I do not know that we have enough information yet to know that in the case of either of these applications with respect to the to the first one, I would suggest the following: you know if you wanted to if you wanted to sort of drill in a little bit more on, what's being proposed here. I would suggest the applicants consider what the deepest affordability they're able to provide would be. Obviously the community board is interested in deep affordability, and I would I would recommend, looking at MIH option three for those for those units which is deeper affordability than option one and see if that works. For you, this was brought up as far as the as far as the apartment sizes is concerned, I think the community board would want to see a mix of apartment sizes for affordable. That includes larger apartments that can be that can be accessible to families under displacement, pressure, inquiry, district aid, and then third, I would say, consider increasing the far for M Crown uses to make up for the loss of the other lots in your rezoning area that where we would not be able to get an I'm assuming, we would not be able to get an agreement from those property owners for M Crown uses. When I did the numbers on those on those lots and added it, you know up to yours in terms of to make up for those lots. I think you would be close to you know. You'd be you'd, be you'd, be a little bit over 35 for for m Crown uses on your la in your area. That would make up for the loss of the ones in the other lots that would be part of your rezoning area. So I would. I would like to suggest that the applicants or the prospective applicants, think about those three things and then perhaps come back and have a follow- up with the community Board. Thank you, mister company. I think we have a closing question from Mr Ellis or closing statement from Mr Ellis. Thank you chair. I did a couple things to kind of echoing a little bit with gibbs said and what Miss Island had said. I'm a little bit apprehensive about looking at a single lot currently without having any indication of what's happening with our M1 Pro Crown M Crown proposal. I think you know, as a committee, we stood our ground some years ago saying that we did not really want to review single lot variance requests or euler applications. This is not. This also be would be one of them. However, I think that as a committee, knowing that now what we've decided we'd like to see as part of M crown if the applicant would want to make a proposal that would stay in line with what we're proposing, maybe that's an opportunity, but I think that's as a committee. We need to decide if that's something acceptable and what we're doing yeah. I also agree with I'm sorry, there's some interference. I think I was saying that this building seems like it has more opportunity at 972 because of it being above the far allowable. Currently, it also seems to have some sort of historical. You know, value being. You know, it looks like I'm looking at the street thing and it's got an old chocolate company, so there is a manufacturing historical legacy there too, which would be interesting to see it preserved if there were going to be any expansions on it. So I think that just miss tias is the chair. I would say that we probably need to create some space as a committee to talk about, since we have a bottleneck at city planning on moving this forward as a M crown zone. But what is it that we will do and can do for? Applicants like Mr, jeffers and others that are coming forward, asking about what they can do with their property? That may not be the highest and best use for them that fits with our community needs. So that's just what I'd like to share in closing on the thinking of these two proposals that Mr Plattnick. Thank you, Mr Ellis. I agree with you 100. We should map out a time we can attend to your recommendations. They make a lot of sense and we need to be able to provide city planning with that type of guidance. So they know that we're willing to stay the course and to pressure OMB to fund the project through DCP. So with that said, I have to thank Mr Kolatnik for coming forward and the owners for the buildings for coming forward and sharing their plans with us. I hope you listened closely to the recommendations from Mr Bocconi, with which I agree with those 100 percent, and I do not know what your plans are for going forward other than meeting with Council member Majority leader Combo. I believe Mr Allen is still on the line. Please keep us abreast of that and I asked Mr Palatnik to send the materials over to council member combo's office so that she can see for herself what you're trying to bring forward and maybe even include some of the recommendations that you heard tonight with that. Okay with that said, I want to move on to the next item on tonight's agenda. After we do a roll call to ensure that we have a quorum to vote on 875, saint mark's, okay, I want to do a roll call now and see who's here to vote on that Princess Ben James. Can? How do we get people to hello? Can you hear me Mr James is on the line. Thank you. Go ahead. John Buckholz, John Buchholz, not here Robert, Callahan, present Janet, collins, Janet collins- are you here. Are you with us?

Item, 875, St, Marks Avenue, the Crown Heights North, Historic district, the application to legalize workers referenced in the following in landmarks violations and they're enumerated in the materials in the invitation and who is present to speak on and present on 875 St marks. Please speak up and give you a name and a title. My name is Guy Cohn. I am the architect for the project and I will be representing the building tonight. Okay, do you have a presentation to make a digital presentation to make? Yes, how do I do that? Do I do the share, I believe so, let's see share content. Okay. So, let's see if this is the right thing here, okay, you want to put it in presentation mode. So it's big and you just see the particular card in there. So presentation mode would be. I see you, I see everybody Wanna put the bigger. Let's see, how do I do presentation Mode? I can't tell you from here I'm so sorry, okay, let me see if I can escape from this for a second and let's see if I can do this okay, here we go participants assign share content. I thought I was doing that we see it's small. I can see it very small, now you're starting to share content. Okay, seen all of your open screens. Sorry, I'm sorry! This is the first time I've worked with you guys and I'm not sure how this works practice makes perfect. I'm sorry what you're getting sorry! This is Dina Shane, I'm one of the owners in the building. I can direct you how to do it sure if you click on share okay and instead of picking screen just pick one of the documents that should be lining up, like you have options of what you're sharing below in the row below the screen. Okay, so you just select the file that you want just to share with us. Well that that's not the file that I wanted to share, let's see or you can go to share file and then select the file. Okay, let's try that let's close this and share that, can you see that you're still, you have to stop sharing first, because you're sharing your screen right now, okay, stop sharing yep, then go back to share now go back to share yeah, and then you select the file here. We go want us to see. Oh that's the file, not the screen, how's that we're still seeing the two pdf documents. Let me turn off one of them, yeah close one of them, how's that and then enlarge. You have to enlarge, go to full screen on your document. Enlarge the document: okay magnify just use the magnifying glass at the top how's that it's still pretty tiny on our screen. Well, I've got it full screen on mine trying to let's see zoom in. Would it be better if you just send the presentation in the chat, so people can look at it? Well, I had sent the presentation originally to the Community board. I thought maybe I was going to be working with that, but whatever you think would be the best way to do it. I'm happy to do. Excuse me this is Lynn cave you can everybody can enlarge it on their own screen. That's awesome! Okay, good! That works. Thank you, Lynn you're! Welcome. Are we good with that? We'll have to do if we want to get through this tonight. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Folks. Can everyone see what I'm sharing now I can not it's too small, too small on the left side of your screen. Miss collins, there's a control panel with a a plus sign and a minus sign where you can enlarge. What's on your screen, yeah? Well, it does not. It does not get any larger. Okay, guys, it works. That's great, it's already, it's already enlarged and it's still my screen. I'm sorry did you get the materials from the office miss collins. Can you bring that up on yours on your machine? Am I the only one that can't see this? I did not poll yet. I know I was able to enlarge it on my screen, so I mean I've. I managed to increase the size of everything by using the buttons that are on the left center part of the screen where you, but otherwise just tried something. I did that help anything. No, oh, I see the buttons now I encouraged I'm good. Thank you thank you. Can you walk us through your materials? Absolutely so I'm not sure how much you know about this building, but I was brought on to this project a few months ago. The original architect of record withdrew from the project a number of years ago. The developer, who developed this project started it around 2012. It was renovated and some of the work was done, but not all of the work was done. The current owners of the building bought into the building, with the impression that the developer was going to complete everything, get the certificate of occupancy and he had taken all responsibility for doing that work and seeing it all the way through to the end. However, the company, the and the developer who started this project went bankrupt. He basically left the project hanging around 2017 and he had gotten a number of landmarks violations. While the process the project was being renovated. So, in short, he left the project he is no longer involved, he's actually left the country. The owners of the condos contacted the attorney general to try and see what they could do to get some sort of closure from this, but they were not able to, and there were a number of landmarks violations that were incurred while the project was done and those were never resolved and the Cfo has also not been completed. So they brought me in a few months ago to try and resolve the landmarks violations and to finalize the cfo. As you can see from the pictures, there are some early pictures, the tax photos of what the building looked like prior to the renovation, and you can see it's really not that much different than what you see now. However, there was a number of things done, such as the windows replaced, repairs done to the front roof paint it was removed from the front base, some pointing generally the scope of work is outlined. I do not want to bore you with all the various details unless you really would like me to walk you through each one individually, but we were about to submit plans and we've been in contact with landmarks to try and rectify all these issues. Now, in some cases, landmarks is perfectly on board with some of the work that was already done, for instance, the front curved windows, the rounded windows on the turret they were done properly. There were, you know, details that were submitted and those were done properly. There were a few outstanding items that are still left over, such as a mailbox in the front and a fence in the back edition that are still under discussion. For instance, there are other things like the original base that were not done. The way that the original drawings for the landmarks permits portrayed. So there's a basically I'm trying to give you a broad stroke of brought paint the picture in broad strokes as to how this whole thing kind of happened and where we are now so with that being the case, we've been in discussions with landmarks to try to resolve some of the issues to try to find out. If landmarks is willing to accept some of the things that were done differently from what the original permit drawings portrayed and we're going through the process of going through. There are certain things that landmarks agreed that they would accept, but there are other things that are go beyond the staff level approvals. That landmarks would accept and that's why we're going through the public hearing process. So with that said, as kind of broad strokes of where we are with this project, the first page shows the pre- renovation photos of the of the building you can see. If I can I'm going to zoom in to details three and four, these were sort of the main bones of contention in this project. These are the best photos we could get. I'm sorry that I can't give you anything better. We did the research we tried to find out if we could find old pictures, but this is the best we could get landmarks provided this to us. You can see that these bays on the side of the building had some pretty detailed, stick work, details around the Lunette windows and metal paneling on the roofs and some of the overhangs and from series from what we can tell all that was stripped off. So that's one of the main bones of contention here you can see from and I'm going to zoom back out here the views of the building now and what you can actually see and can't see those bays are really not very visible. You can see from even across the street it's hard to see those bays because there's trees in the way and the church, which is right next door, is very close, so they're not very present as much as we would have loved to have had those things replaced. The way they normally were we're concerned about the cost and expense and the disruption of having to rip out what's there and replace it with a very ornate, stick, work and metalwork base. So I'll go back out here for a second and go to page two. As you can see, there are some details. I have to explain to you that some of the details here are repetitions from the earlier landmark set. It was approved and then never completed completely, so I've got details in there from the old landmark set, and I've got details in there from the new landmark set, and the reason being is because I will be superseding the architect of record when I take over this job and I file the continuance of the Alt one, the alteration type one, which was the original application to convert this building into condos back in 2013. one of the things that is a little different about this is that we're right now asking to supersede I've got a letter in and we're we've got a request in the billing department for me to reinstate the application the yield 1. So I can supersede the applicant of record, but the first step for us is to get landmarks and your approval. If you agree with us to allow us to move forward and present this or get certain things accepted, which have were done prior to any of the owners being in the building and landmarks acceptance as somewhat of a compromise, let's say to what was originally there. So I just want to walk you through some of the issues that we could not get approved at staff level and why we're going to public hearing one is the mailbox in the front and I'll zoom in. Can everyone see that picture there? Yes, okay! So the original developer put a l, a mailbox in front that allows packages and larger types of mail to be delivered to the building, because the vestibule was very small and you could not put anything larger than a regular small mailbox in there. That's what I'm sort of assuming they their reasoning behind that was and landmarks changed their rules just recently in their recent reiteration or their rule, changes that allow freestanding mailboxes in certain circumstances. So what we'd like to request from landmarks and from you is to allow us to keep the mailbox there, especially these days when everybody's getting packages you know during the pandemic, you need some place, that's secure and that everyone can access and can be locked and it makes it very difficult and boxes would pile up in the vestibule. So we're hoping that you will find this less offensive and allow it to stay. The other thing that we are proposing to do- and I do not have a great picture of it, except for I'll zoom in one of the issues- was that if you can see down here, I'm not sure if my cursor is showing up on your screen. I hope for hopefully it is. Let's see, does that? Does everyone see my cursor down here? I can see it. Okay, good. So one of the requirements of the last permit was to replace these glass blocks with a regular framed window and we're willing to do that. That's not a problem that really is a small item, so we've already agreed with landmarks that we're going to replace the glass blocks with a framed window and keep everything else the way it is. Let me jump over to here the front area of the yard. The actual front railing is a little different from what was originally portrayed on the landmarks presentation drawings. It was a little bit more curved. It was not a right angle with a curve in the middle. It just had a little bit more gentle slope, so we're this is what was put in. We do not think it's offensive. We do not think it's too bad, so we're asking landmarks to approve that and if you see the light post there, that light post was also one of the items that landmarks had an issue with and we're asking them to allow us to keep it, because that was not really on the original approved plans. Let me zoom out again here sorry I'll zoomed in one of the other issues. Oh here's a! Let me give you a zoom in on the mailbox again, there's a mailbox. Sorry when it gets blown up, it gets a little blurry. So I apologize for that. Let me ask May I just interject and ask a question on the target occupancy. How many units are you trying to fit into this building? It's already been occupied since 2013, and the number of units is seven and it's all owned there. There's no there's no construction that we're asking to do on this building we're asking to legalize the work that was done by the developer, who left the project. Okay. Thank you proceed. Please proceed. So one of the other things that was done was that, on the original approved drawings for landmarks, the glass window, the door with the glass window on it was at the front and the solid door was in the second place in the vestibule we're asking what this is. They switched it around. We're asking landmarks to approve it, as is so. The framing of the door is very much exactly like the original landmarks documents showed it's just that they flipped the glass and the solid doors. So that's one of the other things we're asking landmarks to approve and you can see. Let me go to the lintel at the Front Entryway zoom over to here, so you can see the lintel with the 875 on it. They kind of mushed the lintel. What can I say a better term? You know they just they, so we have agreed to restore it back to its original appearance that looked like the lintel next to it, which was carved out of stone. So we've already agreed to do that work. So I'm just explaining to you some of the things that the developer left the owners of the building hanging with. Let me go on to the and we get to the Bay windows or the bays they're. Actually, three bays you can see we're asking landmarks to. Let us keep the bays as they are not have to rebuild them with the very complex, stick, details and metal work and roofs, because it would be so onerous for the building to have to rip that all out at this point as well as the fact is, we do not think it's that offensive. Looking the stucco is nice. They put some details. The windows themselves are curved, so the windows comply with the original permit and the only difference was the stained glass. Is it's and I'll? Take you to the. If I can, you can see the comparison of what the original landmark permits showed on the top and what's there now on the bottom, so you can see this main. This first bay had a little bit more detail work. There was more flaring up at the cornice. There was metal panels on the roof. There were all these were metal panel details and the stained glass was also more detailed. If you look down below it's a little bit more simplified, the actual profiles are still there. The windows are in the same place. They were there's a stained glass window at the bottom, it's not as detailed as beautiful as the original design, but it's what was there and the same happens with the second bay. The you can see the one on top it's more detailed. It's got a bulge of flare in the middle, which was kind of nice, but they took that out, unfortunately, but they covered in Stucco and they put the windows back and it's not it's not. I think all that egregious the last thing that landmarks had an issue with was the railing on the back edition. You can see that there they were okay with the railing, be there being there, but they wanted it set back about three feet, so it would not be seen from the street. So let me jump back to our first to this picture. Sorry, once again, it kind of got a little blurred when I pdfd it and now I'm blowing it up, but you can see that this is the view from the street. I'm going to pull that out slightly and the railing that landmarks had an issue with that they wanted to set back is not even you can you can you can't even hardly see it, maybe during the winter, when the leaves are off the trees, you'll be able to see the railing, but the railing is not to me all that offensive if you'd like to see those I'd have to. I can open that up. Let me see if I can do that real, quick and then you'll get a better idea of what it is. I'm talking about. So let's go to the back here. These are the drawings that I'm superseding the architect of record with and submitting to landmarks and the building department, and you can see from this slide that this is what's there now detail- wise. Is that fairly clear for everybody? I'm not sure if I can't see your screen, so I'm not sure and everybody has different monitors so that also changes things you can see it please proceed okay, so in the back edition you can see the railing you can see that railing and it wraps all the way around that back edition. I've got a detail of that coming up here by the way I'm just going to skip around this is the stained glass window. That's there now, and this is the restored cornice at the front that we're going to duplicate and match the building next door. I'm going to jump a little bit here, I'm happy to jump back when you'd like. Let me see I'm going to go okay, so the railing that you can see. It's not really I'm going to take you back to here and zoom in so the railing is very simple in the back. It's just got vertical pickets, it's got some circles, it's all cast iron, it's and it wraps around the entire back right there. So, as I said, the only issue that landmarks had with this was that they originally wanted. It set back about three feet, so it would not be as visible from the street, but this is what the developer did. They built it all the way around the perimeter of the back edition. Let me go back and zoom out here, so those are the main issues, the one that I was I was outlining to you. As I said, the notes that I have on here are the same notes that were on the original permit and we had to put them there, because we are now basically legalizing the work that was done and I would say at this point probably sixty percent of the work that was originally permitted and approved was done properly, but you still have these outliers like the bays and the mailbox and the glass blocks and things like and the front doors. So everything else landmarks is okay with and we're coming to you and hoping that you won't find it egregious or offensive and allow us to move forward so that we can get some closure on this project, which has been a source of a lot of anxiety and frustration from the owners because they thought the original developer was going to take care of it and they did not, and now they're stuck holding the bag, and during these tough times to have to go back and rip all this stuff out redo. Everything would be a very onerous sort of thing to happen and probably make people pretty desperate. Thank you, Mr Cohn, I'm pretty sure that when the condo use the condos correct, condo owners brought in they knew that this was a historic district. Well, if I, if I may address that miss like tie us together, okay, so this is from 2012 North historic district was in the works, was designated in 2011, so one of my mantras has been over the years. Look before you leap, okay, so as people bought in I'm pretty sure they knew was a historic district. It's not something that happens overnight and LPC approaches historic district designation in a stepwise manner, with lots of notification and outreach to the community. So when people bought in they knew what they were buying into that's true. They did know that and I'm sure that was a selling point and they probably really loved the building, but they also depended on the developer to fulfill his obligations, and you know they knew that there were violations, but the developer had given them. You know enough evidence and said that he was doing it and he actually did take care of a number of things along the way, but then 2017 came along and he basically skipped down and left him holding the bag. You have to keep an eye on what people are doing, especially if you're paying them for the work with historic district residency. There's a an inclusion, there's an obligation that goes along with the benefits. I agree. Okay, so I personally am not sympathetic, but I want to hear from the land use committee members on what they've heard from you this evening. Hi miss Tyus, it's Mr Ellis. Yes, please proceed hi! I miss a Messiah sentiment. This is really disappointing to see this continuously happen in our landmark districts. You know we hear your plea for correcting. You know bad activities by developers from the past, but it's still no excuse that we have to suffer as a community, the diminishing of our beautiful historic housing stock. You know, and while some of these changes that are you saying that you're pro you're preventing points are minor, the nuance impacts and collective impacts of these small little changes really start to degrade some of the holistic integrity of these structures that were developed like this, so that that's just kind of from the beginning- and it seems like we hear this all too often where we're asked for forgiveness instead of permission when it comes to some of these buildings, and this building is quite a stellar building. I mean, let's be honest, it's a very unique building. It's got a lot of some beautiful attributes to it, so it's even more disappointing to see that this happened in this way, and I agree with Miss Tyus that it is incumbent upon the owners. It's incumbent upon any purchasers of these co-, ops or condos to know what they're getting into and while, as I said before, some of these ass that you're presenting today are minor really in individualness but as a collective whole. It really is disappointing to see. So I'm sharing that just as a concern as a steward, you know of our land use and of our historic districts to the to whatever degree I can be. You know be that person I'm noticing just a couple things I'm looking at the Google Street feed. You said this development happened in 2013 correct and there would be it started. 2012 2013 correct. They then knew at the time it was a historic district because it already been nominated in 2011., so they did not go through all that to begin with, I'm looking at a Google street image from August 2014, and it shows a few different things than what you're showing today. The windows had not been replaced at that point. The because there's still some there's still black instead of white, the fence in the front yard, was a much lower fence. It was. It looks like it's only like a little white pic like a little white. What do you call those little small? Sorry, it's a little smaller, it's! Maybe a foot tall off the ground as opposed to what I think you're presenting is a three foot tall fence in the front and obviously on the side. Well, a lot of times you know landmark, does not have to deal with side. Facades are because they're pretty much butted up next to each other. This building is unique because that's got an open space approximate to it. So seeing some of the loss of character on the side of that building is also an issue and the fact that the stained glass wall replaced was replaced with a much less beautiful one, more lower quality, not nearly as ornate, and you lost the characteristic of the half moon portion of what was originally there from what I can tell in the before and afters. So there's just a lot of qualities to this that it's just unfortunate, I mean the mailbox I mean I that's just. I do not think that that's an appropriate thing for that front of that building. It could be sidewalk side instead of out front. We've seen plenty of buildings put their mailboxes like those on the sidewalk frontage rather than in front of the building, and then I really do not have much of an opinion on the back. The rear yard railing just from an individual committee member standpoint, but some of the other stuff, that's already been allowable, some of the stuff that you're asking for today. These are just it's just disappointing that we're having to go through this. At this point and the fact it's disappointing that you're now telling us that you're asking for this because of times are tough and the fact was, is in 2013 2014. They were not tough and they should have been done. The correct way, the first time and so for us to sit there and forgive and nod our heads as a committee to say: okay, it's okay. Now it just continues to set precedence, and I just really am disappointed in this. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. Thank you, Mr Ellis, you echoed yes, you echoed my sentiments very clearly. I just want to mention the simplicity of some of these complaints is insulting before I go to the Crown Heights North Association, which has championed this area and worked diligently to preserve these beautiful buildings. I just can't understand why it would be such a big problem to switch the doors and put the glass in the front as most of the houses have them, and at that point, is it sport alternative to Crown, Heights, North, Association Deborah has a comment from from that neighborhood association that championed the creation of these historic districts. Here, ms young, please unmute yourself, sorry, okay! I am not going to take the time to repeat what was already said by Miss Tires and Mr Ellis, because I echo the same sentiments, but a couple of things that I take issue with and one is to have someone come before us and ask for forgiveness and say how and speak to how it's not offensive to them. That's hard for me to accept, because you live here, you and you do not own on that block you're, not one of the owners who invested in the community who worked hard to maintain their homes. So I portion not only you but any developer, who wants to present and ask for forgiveness for things that could have been avoided. Well, I got I understand that you're, not you know directly responsible, because you did not do this to begin with, but now and say how you do not feel it looks that bad or this does not look that bad. It's inappropriate for the people who have to look at this every day. Okay, that's one thing I want to say. The other thing is that in essence, you just received the letter that we sent and we are urging you to make all of the reservations as close to Sec as you can to what was originally there. We, the mailbox, is definitely out that's not something we can support we'd. I did not realize that the LPC wanted you to move the fence back, but we were recommending that you, if you're, going to have a fence that you do a little more ornamental, make it a little more historically ornamental and the bays we want them back to the original design as close as possible and the windows. The windows should be back to their landmark condition. I mean you have other homes on that block who has maintained, and while you are not responsible, the developer or the owners, you know my heart aches when we when I think about what that house used to look like before it was broken up into condos. That house was on a tour we had been in that house and it breaks my heart just breaks my heart to know what was done and again that's not before LPC, but that's just something I wanted to share with the community when we think about what was in there to what it is. What's been done now, so we encourage you to adhere to what was there before. Thank you. Thank you, miss young. I want to make sure that the owners are aware that historic preservation runs from the local level up to the federal level and when you look at the statues that govern historic preservation on all three levels, they all start out with. Look back at your history. Keep your culture know where you came from. So you know where you're going and also tourism is a big thing on all three levels for historic preservationists. To that extent, they all of them LPC city level, throughout New, York state and the other areas and counties upstate, the state itself, state historic Preservation office and the federal government have programs for historic preservation. Tax credits raise your hand if you are owner at 875, St marks and you're aware of the preservation, tax credits. No okay, bad got ta talk to people. Okay, this area is considered mostly a distressed census tract unlike prospect heights with people a little bit wealthier over here, we're not as wealthy. So to help with historic preservation. The state gives substantial historic preservation, tax credits. If you tell the state what you're doing to your property, they will give you a 20 tax credit. If it's eligible stuff, then there's an additional 20 tax credit on work. You do on your historic property from the Feds and you run that application through the state, but since nobody in the building is talking to the folks in the community board to let them know, what's available, you're struggling and floundering around and wasting a lot of money when the planning was not done out the gate so yeah here, you are throwing good money after bad. We are just trying to repair what so, essentially most of the people who bought in the building. We all signed our purchase agreements around the same time, and then we were given the punch list, a promise punch list from the sponsor of everything that they were, that they were going to do, including these violations, and then we it took us all like about a year to close, because there supposedly were fixing remedying these violations. It was over a year for me and then so and also my day. Most of us were first- time buyers at the time, so we were definitely duped without knowing and all of our like everybody had an attorney doing their due diligence prior. So all these things were hidden and then obviously we're not trying to ask for forgiveness for something that we did. We are trying to remedy the most essential ones violations, but at the same time, we're also not rich people where, like a thirty thousand dollar assessment, is something that I can just pull out of my pocket and it goes for everybody in the building we have it took us forever and there was like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours on behalf of other two other owners who were going between landmarks and department of buildings trying to find out the way for us to rectify these things. So we can actually put things right and get our cfo and not keep having issues with violations and notices being put on our building door. So in I just wanted to set that straight like we did not ask for the for the mailbox to be there. We did not ask for them to eliminate the arches or the bays and obviously for somebody who is not like for me. I appreciate the beauty of it and I am all for preservations, but for me it was not obvious that there were things done inappropriately to the point where, to the tune of having to tear out a whole side of the building, and we were promised, we have the punch lists from all of our separate closing documents saying that everything was going to be done and then this company just disappeared and but if you google them actually, there are bigger projects that they skip down on and it turned out that they were like owned by a shell company from another country. So we all got put into a pretty precarious situation for very many years now, and then one other thing I wanted to correct is that we all signed our purchase agreement. So they started. I guess they were working on the building like from 2012 or whatever. We all of us signed purchase agreements in 2014 with punch lists to be addressed and then again at closing in like second half of 2015 is when most of us close on our condos. So it was like a very long and painful process and I, as a first- time, buyer was not aware that it would be so easy for them to skip out on all the work, and I think everybody else in the building was about of the same mindset. And can I just add something to that. If I may miss Tyus, I have great respect for the history and the details of architecture. I pride myself on being a very sensitive architect, who is also very concerned about historic preservation and that's why the clients asked me to come and represent them, because I've had worked with landmarks for 30 years and I've done very detailed projects. The issue here is that, despite the fact that it's a beautiful building- and I and I mourn the loss of the details and the fact that this and I and I actually took it- I walked into the building next door. I knocked on the door and the owner of the building, the sister building of this complex allowed me to walk through. I was just blown away by the woodwork, the detail, the stained glass, the wainscoting. It was just amazing. You do not see anything like that anymore and I mourn that intensely. But here I am now you know seven years later, basically trying to help these people who were stuck they were. They were not responsible for anything that is currently on the building they're living in the building they're trying to get their cfo. They want to resolve the issues but to have to go backwards. At this point you can't you can't undo what was done without significant damage to the people who were actually affected to begin with, so it becomes a moral dilemma. Do you do you punish the people who were punished to begin with, or do you try to move forward? Accept the responsibility that this happened? Try to prevent it in the future, and I always- and I always when a client comes to me and asks me whether or not they can remove historical fabric I'll tell them. That would be a horrible thing to do. It would be a catastrophe and it would ruin the character of this building that, whatever period that building represents okay, I do not want to cut you off, but the I believe I'll get your email and send it to you. There is a course coming up for brokers actually, but I think it would cover architects as well, where you can learn about the benefits and the requirements for historic preservation and, as far as I know, there are options available to owners who are stuck as you describe it, and have a substantial financial burden to me to restore their property to historic preservation standards. There are grants available, it sounds like no one is doing any research on this you'd rather come in and say, look this happened and we just want you to forgive, but I want to hear some more from the committee members on this: it's not my decision alone. So I want to hear from committee members I see Johnny Granville's hand is up and also Mr Viconi with anybody in the chat Mr Ms Granville. Would you please proceed in Mr Bocconi, you hear me. Yes, I can hear you go ahead. Okay, I'm sitting here shaking my head, because I do not understand how people move in and if you look at all of the buildings on that block, they're, so beautiful that building has stuck out like a sore thumb for the last. What four or five years? Every time I went to a block party there, I'm looking at this building and I'm saying well what the hell is going on, because it does not look like anything there. Yes, they have made a financial investment but think about all of the people. Who've been there all this time who took care of their property and they did not go to any Block Association meeting. Somebody could have told them about the tax credit program. They did not reach out to any of the neighbors. I do not understand you just move in, but when you're having a problem, you do not even think about reaching out to your nearest neighbors to ask them what they could do to ask them why their building does not look like the one that you're living in and I'm sure Shirley Mondesu was on the call she's, the president of Black Association, I'm sure they were horrified to see how that building was taking their track, their property values down. I just do not understand and it does not set a good precedent, because if we allow it, then that means the next time somebody comes along and says: oh, we have a series of mistakes, landmarks will look at us and say: well you let them do it. So why not the next folks, it's not good at all and I'm not happy to hear that nobody reached out there's a block association right there. They did not reach out to the board either and Shirley montesso. If you're listening. I would like you to speak because I'm sure you were horrified as a homeowner. Thank you. Thank you. Miss Granville, Mr Verconi. I'm going to give Mr atkins. Are you on the line? I do not see what is going on yeah someone in line. Can you hear me? Yes go ahead? Thank you, Mr Guy. I do not know your last name, Cohn Kohn, Mr Cohn. Thank you for coming out. I I'm not going to waste time. Everyone who spoke from the board basically echoed my feelings over under around and through Miss young, from China chronic North association made the point that the level of detail in these buildings, which you said you saw or I'm not sure if you did the particularly the wainscoting, the parquet floors and then the stained glass, but I viewed this house and the house is on this block from an entirely different perspective. I would say that I was aware of the houses of the on this block from 1956. see. I grew up around the corner and I live around on the other block on Bergen Street and there has been a there's a phrase. That's used now, demolition by neglect. That is basically, in my opinion, what is kind of happening on Saint Mark's, one of the houses for some reason was totally gutted and removed. There was a huge gap and then it was replaced with a hideous house. I do not have to point it out if you walk down the block, there's something that has no context to all the other houses are the pictures that you provided they're Atlantis trees growing. Alongside of the house. I want to believe that one of my childhood friends lived in this house back in the late 50s and the way the the Portal to the house where they put the house number up. That is just disgusting. All the houses had a one foot or one 18 inch high white stone wall that ran the length of all those houses down to the mansion across the street, from the children's museum people who and the lady who spoke was one of the owners they wanted to come into that block, because the houses were ornate and beautiful, but they never considered how they got to be that way, and it's just a total desecration and I've been watching. This happen for at least 20 years, and I'm saying to myself who is taking care of this. I did, and I knew about landmarks, because my church went before landmarks, not the same exact one, but it seems in certain communities. Certain things are more flexible than others and what's been happening here is just atrocious. It has to stop somewhere. Thank you for allowing me to speak. You're welcome, Mr Atkins. I believe we will have Mr Verconi next and then Caitlyn Henderson who's, an owner who asked in the chat to speak, Mr, Ficoni and then Caitlin Henderson. My comments will be brief. I just wanted to express sympathy to the owners and regret the position that they're in, unfortunately, the board has to be concerned about the maintenance of its historic districts forever in the future, for the future going forward and by supporting the legalization of changes to the approved plans here, we'd effectively be giving license to any future developer. To do the same thing to shortcut the approved plans to save some money and then seek legalization later and it just it just does not work. It's not a it's not a precedent that we can that we really can set, and so it's not without sympathy to your situation that I would say I just could not support legalizing these. These changes either and as difficult as it is. I hope you kind of at least can understand where we're coming from the historic districts need to be preserved, and this is how we preserve them. Thank you. Thank you. Mr Coney is Caitlyn. Henderson still want to speak. Yes, thank you very much for allowing me to just speak on behalf of the building. I'm going to try to say this as eloquently as possible. I first of all want to say that I respect every single thing that has been said here and I agree with you. So I and I and I appreciate your passion for preserving the block, because it is a gorgeous block, which is one of the reasons why I was drawn to purchase a property in this building and for those of you who are very familiar with the block and witnessed the demolition by neglect before we came on the scene, because that is when the demolition by Neglect occurred. I'm very sorry- and I can only imagine how that feels from my perspective, I you know, arrived on to this building for the first time at an open house and was told about all of the privileges and benefits of landmark building, and we were told you know and again due diligence, and I do understand that I'm not completely naive, but we were sold a landmark property and told that things were being done up to code and they were working on some things and everything was going to be handled and everything was going to be taken. Care of. We even had that in our closing documents that these things, where everything was going to be taken care of it, was not really brought to our attention that things were done incorrectly until we realized that our Tco, we were unable to renew our Tco and our certificate of occupancy, and there were problems with that, and that is when we came to realize that these landmark that these there were certain things done on the property that were not to code as far as landmark approval, which was extremely disappointing for us, because we did not, we did not realize that they had cut so many corners. Unfortunately we're in this situation where there were seven owners, I'm a New, York, City, School teacher I've been working on this case myself personally for three years. Guy has just come on in the in the last few months, even pre pandemic, because we're not just trying to plea to you because it's a pandemic and times are tough. We've been working on this for years. I've I personally have gone and spoken to Ira Gluckman the commitment. At the time I scheduled a meeting. I spoke to him. I've been working on this personally for a very long time, the cost of what it would cost to bring things back to before Bose Gilead did what he did to the building. I just I know would just be. I know that we would not be able to. It would be very difficult for us to do it, and I appreciate you bringing to our attention that there are options for owners who are stuck in this situation and we can absolutely pursue those. But I do plea to you to understand that we are just regularly people who have been put in this situation and the damage that has been done that have been done that are not up to code was not our doing, and if we could go back in time and do it ourselves and make sure that it was done the right way we absolutely would have, which is why we're hot we've hired guy to try to fix it. We want to be in good standing. We we want to do as much as we can to get this property to landmark status, but it has to be something that we can actually do. Thank you, Ms Henderson. I believe that there's a lack of information coming to you through the city agencies that you've been working with, I'm surprised and appalled that department of buildings did not tell you to seek the grants and tax credits that are available for for historic preservation. Talking preservation, not renovation, okay, so those things are still there and I hear the baby in the background. I understand the the detriment that doing this kind of retrofit can do to one's wallet, but I have said to you: there's a grant. Mr Cohen is saying he can't even take some screws out of the doors that are there and switch the glass one to the front, so it corresponds to the rest of the theme in the neighborhood. We won't even do little things like that. So I question the sincerity of the pleas for just. Let us put this behind us. We had to do it this way because we ran out of money. If you won't even switch the doors and all that's a couple of screws taking them out and putting that glass, the top door in the front and put the solid wooden door second little things like that, won't even try! So I'm not here. Yes, we're going to look at grants. Yes, we're going to look for homeowner credits. Yes, we're going to check for grants on the state level. Yes, we're going to check for grants. I'm not hearing that! I'm hearing! We want you to forgive us, because we made a mistake. We did not check carefully enough. So sorry, so sad too bad just give us a pass. That's what I'm hearing well Miss Tyus! May I just mention one thing regarding the door, we looked at the idea of switching them, they're two different sized doors, they're, not exactly the same, so that would mean rebuilding both doors to switch them completely. Now we had talked it over with landmarks and we thought it would be easy. We were willing to switch the doors. That would be not a problem, but then we measured them and found that they were two different sizes. So that's why we asked if we could I'm not going to take you through the half an inch or one and a half inch differences between those two doors, because the time is not going to allow us to do that fair enough, but I suspect that the size difference could easily be ameliorated. I'm not going to go any further. I'm sure there are other people who want to weigh in on this conundrum in which you, as our neighbors, miss Shine, Ms Henderson. You find yourselves. My sympathies are with you. I've had bad contractors come into my home and screw up stuff. That cost me tens of thousands of dollars to fix. So I understand. Are there any other comments on this request? Yes, Mrs collins would like to comment Miss Titus. You also have Miss Mondaceae, who wants to speak and Princess James wants to speak. I know Ms Mondaser is the head of the Saint Mark's Independent Block Association, so Miss Collins. I would like Ms Mondasir to speak now. If you do not mind, no, I do not mind go right ahead. I can hear you now go ahead. You have to unmute yourself, Shirley. Okay, can you hear me now? Can I be here? Yes, okay, great okay, yeah, I'm, the president of the Black association have been for some time and we always try to reach out to everyone in the block. I'd like to sort of speak about the mailbox, because all the mail on most of the houses is put in the mail slot. Okay and the mailbox does not go along with the beauty of the mail slots that we have and enhancing our historical block. I really do not agree with that. However, I did look at the a place where the mailbox could possibly be moved, so it would not be standing right there out of the house. I I'm asking that you reach out to me. We have meetings and you were certainly welcome to join in anything that we can do I'm here to help you. Thank you. Thank you. What's next did I skip over anybody? I missed one guys I believe Ben James had asked before hi good evening. You know what I'm a homeowner and I sit back and I heard everything that was said. First. I can not understand you had lawyers everybody's saying that individual lawyers, it seems, like your lawyers, have not done due diligence with you first, how can you sign off on contracts knowing that these land, the developers, did not complete all the work, and there was no money left in Estro to fix work that is needed, but now you're coming and asking us to retractively bless what did wrong. I am my first homeowner to most of us who own buildings or own homes were once considered first- time, homeowners. So by I'm hearing that I'm a first- time, homeowner, I'm a first- time, homeowner, you all once more. I wish I would just like to tell you as what Caitlyn said. No, but what I'm sorry money, Yo, one of the things that I learned you money should have been left in Estro, because I can not understand that you guys signed off knowing that all the work was not done, promise you he was giving you a promissory note fix something when you guys are paid. That should not have happened. So I think you guys need to go back and speak to your lawyers, because money should have been left in Estro, because I had when I bought my building. There was a problem like that, and I made sure there were money in estrella and esther account to fix what needed to be fixed in my building before I signed off and at that time I was a first- time. Homeowner knows nothing about buying house, but I did my research and that's what it's all about. Doing your research and like Miss Munderson said you bought into a community where people were live. People are living, but you never take the time to get to know the people in the community to ask questions you just decided to buy now when things go wrong. These same people in the community. You want to come back to ask for to help to help come back to an actual solution, and I do not think that is fair to us, because we all follow the rules and the laws that govern homeownership in our community, and I do not think we should that's. What has you know had happened to you. I am sorry, I'm a homeowner too, but I do not think we should bless what's going on right now. Thank you has been James. I believe Miss Collins is next hello. I think some people are not muted and there's a lot of noise. Can I be heard? Yes, I can hear you miss Collins, I'm not hearing the noise that you're hearing whoever's not here. There are a lot of people like guy and a few other people who are not muted, and I think that's where the noise is coming from. Thank you, miss collins. Will everyone please mute themselves, so Ms Collins can make her statement. Thank you go ahead, Ms Collins. Thank you. Well, I'd like to agree with you and everybody else and princess, because I was going to the reason why I raised my hand, is I wanted to speak directly to miss Henderson and I guess the guy and everybody else, who's the other woman Kristen or of Diana and all the other resid homeowners there at that. I think most avenue you have just been presented with some options that you said you did not know about as far as local state and federal funding to get this work completed. That would you know, help you out, but I do not hear a sigh of relief in your voices. It's like you're, still not interested in going out and pursuing that I've not heard anything like that. I'm speaking right now, thank you. It's in the chat, I'm speaking right now, but I'm not hearing your voice. I said I'm not hearing. Are you listening to what I'm saying? I do not hear that I'm not reading the chest, I'm reading your voice, I'm reading your expression and it phil still seems to be well. You know I do not hear well we're going to go and pursue that. That's very good to know. That's going to be very helpful. I do not hear any of that coming from you all, so I actually put excuse me. Would you let me finish, please, and I think the chairs recognize you. The chair has to recognize you to speak. Okay, sorry about that. Okay, so I we hope you have to understand that you have a responsibility as a homeowner, just like Mrs Princess said I have that responsibility as a homeowner and like everybody is telling you this is a landmark community and we have to put big our heels in, because there's everybody coming in wanting us to break the rules and let them do what they want to do. It's your responsibility to make sure things are in order before you put your hands handcuffed on a piece of paper. You just do not listen to developers or anybody saying this is going to be done and that's not going to that's going to be done without making sure that it's done. So there are a lot of options for you right now, and I do not hear anybody expressing the gratitude that you just found out about that information. I actually wrote in the chat earlier and I did not see that I will read it to you. I said we, the homers homeowners, would very much appreciate if you could share more information about the grant, so we can be sure to be moving in the right direction. I wrote that earlier because I did not want to interrupt right now, I'm not hearing any I'm, not hearing, I'm not hearing. That being said, I just I hear the arguments still being made that you should be forgiven as opposed to going out and looking, and maybe it's not you, but I'm speaking to whoever's been talking and that's what I've been hearing. Okay, so that's my feel on it and I just want to make that my point. Can I reach I'm sure yeah, please. So I'm sorry if it did not come across that I was not appreciative for the grants information because I did mention that I was not aware of that, and I am appreciative to know about that because we're going to need it. You know I and the other thing that I want to add is that I think that we're we are open to listening to. You know what to coming to some kind of agreement, or you know we're not asking for like full forgiveness. We realized that the developers made a lot of mistakes. We did not realize that at the time. I assure you that I promise you that when we came to that property, I had no idea that they had. You know, done what they did to this side of that building the first. The first time I ever came to that building was at that open house. I had been on the block before I had taken my nephew to the children's museum once before, and I admired the block a year or two before I ever went to that open house. So I realized that, but I did not know that they had done what they did to the side of the house and, like I said earlier, for those of you that witnessed that demolition and saw that the you know the change from what was originally there to what those contractors did before we even came onto the scene. That must have been horrible for you, and I feel terrible about that. So I'm not for forgiveness for myself, because I did not. I was not aware that they had done what they did and demolished. You know the thingies the way that they did. I do not. I do not want to speak for guy and for Dina, but I will say myself. I agree it. You know if there are some things that we can do and apply for grants and switch the doors and nuke a few. You know cheap, more whip, the bail boxes, change those things out and you can afford it and it's something that we can actually get done. I'm willing to do it. I you know I own the largest unit in the building, so I have the biggest stake in that building and, like I said, I've been putting a lot of time and effort into trying to get the building into good standing. We do not want to be bad neighbors. We do not want to okay, so then I guess the next conversation needs to be because we've heard that- and we heard your point of view, I think we need to move this on and I think what you all need to be asking about is to get a way to get those applications. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, miss collins and thank you, miss Henderson, I'm truly sympathetic and I'm trying to figure out ways that we can get you the information you need to pursue. That would be one evening's business. At this point, I have to ask the land use committee members for a motion on this item. Unless there are any other comments or questions, I ask for a motion on the item. Unless there are any other comments or questions I'll make a motion I'll make a motion that we not support the legalization of the project as presented seconded okay, I have a motion on the floor not to support the project that's presented and I have a second. Are there any other questions on the motion? That's on the floor before I call the roll hearing, none I'm going to proceed with the roll Paul. This is the motion not to support the project. So that's means no 75 St Marks Avenue Princess Ben, James, Princess Ben James. Okay, are we voting? Yes for no or how are we doing? This is a motion to withhold support yeah. So if you vote yes, you're voting against the project. Yes, okay, John vocals, Robert, Callahan, Hi, Janet, Collins, yeah, Norah Daniel. Yes, it's so faint. I think you said yes, James Ellis, I believe he's gone Kathy Island, yes, Nigel, Nick, collins, maybe mute herself. I think that's where we're hearing all the interference miss collins. Can you mute yourself? Please? Thank you. Deborah young mute yourself. Please, let's see up to Johnny Granville Johnny, Granville, you're muted. I believe you you're, muted, you're, muted, okay, nod your head up and down. Okay, that's a yes: okay, Josema Jordan, Peter, Crassus, Sarah Lazar, yes, Jerry Norton, not here Robert, Puka, Adam Sachs, not here Meredith Staton Ethel tires. Yes, give bacony give bocconi. Let me get! It is good for still on the line. Good chat. Okay, he's in the chat, I'm sorry trying not to miss anybody. Yes, okay, thank you. What's Miss Jordan say what did Miss Jordan said? Yes, she said yes, okay. I did not hear you before. Thank you, so we missed give vacante. Yes, okay, let me count up the vote. One two, three, four, five: six, that's it well! We have 12, yes, no abstentions and no negative votes motion carries and I would invite you to look at options from Lpc's grants. New York, Landmarks, Conservancy, New, York, State, Historic, Preservation, Office, Preservation, League of New York. They all have grants in addition to the grants, double check that your census tract is still considered distressed. If so, you have a 20 home owners, tax credit available to you. If any of the units in the building are rented, you will have an additional 20 percent federal tax credit available to you for eligible items or both of those two different lists. State list is a little different from the federal list for work that you do on your building. Take pictures before send it to the state they bless it. You get the work done, send them pictures or tell them afterwards when the work is complete and you get a letter back to take the cost off of your taxes. Okay, you can get to me. Ee tires gmail.com I'll, try to answer questions. If you want to have a homeowners, Association meeting, I will plan to attend. If you let me know, but this is where we are now, and this is the best we can do at this time. Thank you possible to just ask one more clarifying question before you guys move on to the next thing. I respect your decision, my question, just as far as is there any way that we can continue the conversation. I understand how you feel, but there are a number of different items that would need to be repaired. Is there any way that we can con, continue the conversation or explore the option of some of the items being addressed and some of them being agreed upon? I do not see where LPC is helping you, and so you know going forward. Department of buildings and LPC are not friendly to each other, and I'm surprised and appalled that the Department of buildings was not more helpful to you and also appalled. That LPC was not more helpful to you. That LPC was going to negotiate with us on some of these outstanding issues. They did not tell you about the grants, no grants. Nobody mentioned grants to you so that part alone is enough. Okay, so I guess my question is as far as next steps as far as the Community board goes, and I appreciate your email address, I jotted it down and I do plan to contact you and I do plan to contact Shirley Montecire. I happy to meet you and happy to continue conversations. I just want to know as far as owners what our next step would be aside from applying for the grants, just in continuing the conversation with the community board. What? Where would we go from? You know with being in good standing with you, because we know that we need to get your approval in order to move forward. Okay, just to be clear, just I'm sorry, Miss Collins, I'm speaking, I'm so sorry, just to correct the vote count we have 11. Yes, okay, we have 11, yes, not 12.! Thank you Ms Daniel. So your next step is a hearing at LPC. The community board will be sending a letter to LPC capturing tonight's decision where you go from there, it's hard to say: they'll have our advisory opinion they'll make their own decision and if I were you so ultimately so you'll so in a guide, please chime in if you, if I'm just I'm just sorry I'm. This is all just really so new to me and I'm trying to just understand the whole process that you will put in your recommendation and your vote to LPC, and then I believe we have an LPC hearing schedule is not that correct. That's correct and I'll explain to you after the meeting what the next steps are. Next, your date is the 17th. That's correct! Okay! Well, I do appreciate everyone's time and thank you so much for your input and thank you for listening to our situation. Yeah and let LPC know that they that you you're asking them for information on their programs. They should be tying you in to the other preservationist organizations in the city. They all offer grants New York, Landmarks, Conservancy municipal arts society. They all offer grants. So if you piece this thing together nobody's just going to throw money at you have to go after it, no okay, so I work for it and research. I'm sorry! This has happened to you and I'll help. You, however, I can as an individual. These things change these programs change from year to year, but you really should just do a google search for historic preservation. Grants simple enough. You'll be amazed at what pops up okay and they all have deadlines. Some of them are coming up so take advantage of the technology to hunt for the money to do what needs to be done to bring your building in into compliance with Ftc's codes. Dobs codes without a certificate of occupancy or your insurance is going to go in the toilet, a lot of stuff to be done there, but it teamwork. If you have an association in the building, there's seven of you are all the units occupied. Yes, okay, so you guys got to team up partial it out and get the work done. Do not expect Cohen to do it all by himself seriously. Okay, the lawyers. You should go back to them and slap them upside the head and get some of your money back since they did an escrow for you, okay, a lot of a lot of the services you deserved were not provided. So this is what happens. So I'm sorry this has happened, but I'm going to move on. I'm trying to see look back at the agenda for tonight. I think we cleared our items and if you want to put off going to LPC for a hearing with a negative recommendation waiting in the wings and try to get some of this together and come back with a much shorter list of things, maybe it could be reconsidered, I'm not sure, but that's the best. I can say for what the situation is now. Thank you Miss. Thank you! Mrs Ty, Miss Tyus. Yes, all right! I appreciate it so committee members: is there anything else we need to cover Miss Tyus. May I this is Kathy island, may I say something quickly, miss times yes go ahead. Thank you. I know everybody's been on the line a long time and we've discussed some important things. I just want to mention that on November 10th, there's a very important meeting of the housing committee, which has we'll probably discuss an issue that has real implications for land use as we discuss affordable senior housing. So if people on the land use committee are available to attend the housing committee, I think it will be very informative to some discussions that we may need to have going forward, and it would be great if people could attend that meeting. Thank you very much. What time is that meeting? I believe the meetings on the very useful community board 8 calendar, which, thanks to whoever pointed that out to me that you can see all the meetings and get all the links on that Calendar miss Tyus. Do you know what time the meeting is? I do not have it in front of me. Okay, thank you. It's on Tuesday, I believe, and it's it will discuss way into the land use issues, so it would be great to have people getting as much information as they can before our next meeting to discuss those issues. Thank you, okay. So, unless there's something else, do I see Kathy you made your statement is: are there any other notices or announcements? Committee members, Mrs Granville has our hand. Can you hear me? Yes, can you hear me bro, yes, go ahead, you might want to mention for people like Sarah and other people who wanted to know when Richard Barack would be helping us. You may want to mention Monday. Okay, I'm going. I do not have my calendar open in front of me, November, 9th, November, 9th Monday, November 9th, I believe we're starting at 5.. Yes, it's early on our calendar, 6 P.M, Okay, 6 P.M on our web backs it's on our calendar. Thank you. Can you be clear? What is what is that for Monday, a lot of noise happening? Can you repeat everything please Monday is a presentation by the borough president's land, Use Director, Richard Barack, on uniform land use, review procedure, you'll, be doing a powerpoint presentation on that process and how it's going to affect certain parcels in this community district? Okay, all right so can that information be sent out to us. So it has not been this yeah. It was sent out two days ago to both the land, Use Committee and both housing advocacy, Google groups. It has been sent out already. I have a question is that is that training available to just the public at large? Yes, awesome, I'm going to let some people know who I think would like to know absolutely all about all of the Community board meetings are open, so please come. The housing committee meeting is a pick up on HPD scoping for senior housing in near the M Crown area, so that would have been on our agenda tonight. But we expected a item that eventually dropped out, 285 kingston, which should come before us in December, and we will have that review at that time and going forward into December city planning is going to be presenting on two different dates on their population and and verification data population, demographics and then the follow follow- up meeting, also directed at them, will be on capitol planning. So we'll be looking at that too. So we'll be busy over the next week and a half and the first week in this week or two in December full board meeting next Thursday hope to see you all there. Then, unless there's something else, I asked for a motion to close a meeting. I have one last question: Julia: can you do you recollect what date that email was that you know, so I can go back and look for it. It's collins, I posted it in the chat and I'm sending it out again within the next two minutes. Very good. Thank you. Thank you. Miss Neil again, unless there's something else as promotional Mrs Granville had her hand up. Can you hear me yeah? Can you hear me? Go ahead Mrs, I just want to say, remind people that in this city you are penalized for what you do not know. So, when you have a chance to speak to people and get information reach out to people read things when you have a chance to be on a mailing list as inclusive as ours is take advantage of it because you are paying the lives for what you do not know. I make a motion to end the meeting. Please yeah. This is a second beckon meeting is adjourned. Thank you all for coming good night good night, everyone good night.
