Miss, Collins, okay, welcome, okay, Miss Raspberry is here to present a proposed plan to build at 9:59 Sterling place with 1242 lot. Seventy I'm posing a six story: development. That's a hundred eighty eight thousand, eight hundred twenty six square foot with a hundred ninety one apartments proposing a thirty, affordable and seventy market rate apartments. This the proposed development is located within the Crown Heights North Face historic development is that very damp. The owner I'm just I'm a consultant on the project. So the owner and the development team is on the line as well I'm sending the names now, as well as the Arkadiy, the architectural firms that are involved. What kind of consultant are you consulting? Well I'm a lobbyist, give us more information about where you're from and what you're lobbying. For my personal information, my name is Tiffany raspberry I'm from Brooklyn New York, originally I've served a few years ago on community board 3, so very much respect owing me. The opportunity to come here. I am lobbyist here in New York City in New York State I, mostly represent projects that are come before the City Council and before community board should such as yours. Okay, all right before I did have a couple of conversations with Miss Tyus, who was the chair of the landmark and what what I'd love to do is just open up with a couple of statements before I turned it over to you: miss Raspberry, okay, all right, as I mentioned, my name is Debra Young and I'm. Here as a representative on several fronts. First I live in the community. Second I am the president of the Crown Heights of North, Association and Third, and not necessarily in that order of priority I'm, also on the Community board. Okay, what I'd like to share with everyone is that Crown Heights North started reaching out to the her bronze school dating back to 2004 intent was to work with them to help them meet whatever goals that they were trying to achieve for themselves in terms of the building on Park Place, the school that is, we were not successful in any of our outreach efforts dating back to 2004 coming forward. Last year, August 30th, the Braun leadership, agreed to meet with us, and that means it's scheduled on a Saturday the meeting at the request of the her Braun leadership. They access to reschedule that meeting because it was their Sabbath respectfully. We had no problem with that. They agreed to get back to us in about two weeks with a new date from August 30th to October I think it was about six. We had ongoing outreach made ongoing outreach to get a date from the they gave us another date on a Saturday. We were concerned about that because of what happened the first time so up until December of last year, we made numerous efforts to sit down with the Habra congregation, because we were very concerned about preserving historical culture, serving the Ha Bron and working with them to get them to utilize some of the resources that we knew were available to them to help them achieve their goals. So we were a little disappointed that we are here today without having had an opportunity to meet with the whole Braun congregation. The second thing, I'd like to say, is that it was very unfortunate that we did not receive a copy of the plans for this development so that we could have looked for them. We just received them today and I know: Monsieur Asbury, you and I had a communication via email on Monday I. Believe I did request that you send them to us, because we have a process that we go through to come to a meeting with a project of this magnitude and look at the plans, the plants just now. It does not help us prepare to you know into to look at them and draw up our questions. The other thing that we're concerned about is that you know the neighbors were not informed about the meeting. I know we have some community residents on the vine, but that was because at the last minute you know we made some efforts so those young can we just hear the presentation first they are. We are going to hear it. I just wanted to say those few things and I'm about ending right now, it's George, okay and going to turn it over to Mrs., Barry. Okay, so I just wanted to share that with you in this Rep Miss Raspberry, so I'm glad we're here and we will have an opportunity. You know to hear what you have to present: okay, I'm, going to turn it over to you now. Thank you very much and I sincerely apologize that we did not send the first version of the proposal of this presentation on Friday. We had a mixup on the team and each thought that someone else had done it. So we sincerely apologize. It was our intention to send you the first draft to the Community Board on Friday, and so we did not realize that did not happen until today, and so we did. We are sincerely apologized, for that was not our intention. I'm, not making this presentation alone. I submitted names to the host of a handful of people that I believe are on there. Maybe I may have left out a person or two so I do not know if it could I make a recommendation that everyone who all of the attendees who are here for to be a part of this team, if you can press the raise hand, icon I, think it might be easier for everyone to be identified and welcomed into the meeting Danny Collins speaking enough not help out, it will help, but not everybody if present is shown on my screen. So that does not tell me everybody I spent names to the host and it's my hope it has joined us. Miss. Are you here finally managed to get in I had to leave my laptop and go to my desktop? We got stopped speaking now. Okay, so I'm sorry to be late. I've learned the lesson today, I apologize and where are we ask all of the presenters to raise their hand, so I can make them panelists so that we can hear them. No we're not going to do that. We're going to have one main presenter, okay and I that'll be Miss Raspberry. Maybe she'll have an additional person, but we're not going to have a number an odd number. What is the number so there we have different sections of the of the presentation that have different presenters so represent one person for each section. Yes, the representatives from the church are going to start us off. Then the architectural team is going to present and the developer is also on hand as well. Okay, I'm asking you to have one person from each of your team sections. Is that? Okay? Yes, okay! Thank you. Let's clear my screen, I'm just going to confirm with who that should be okay. So if you could just give me a second sure, no problem I think we should step through your PowerPoint presentation and did not have questions as I've been done with George. No okay, I think we should do that. I do not I miss the opening. Were there any opening announcements for than any of the neighborhood groups? This young, no I made a statement, but no, we did not have opened it up to the community. We are going to as you and I had discussed earlier. We're going to I turned it over to this raspberry now, okay, so the open to the community for questions and comments can come after her presentation. Okay, so we've got through the PowerPoint. Yes, okay, Claire we're trying to get rid of this thing in the middle of my screen, all right. So there's that you have 95 people, are[, Applause], traveling there dear microphone, everybody! The committee have any other business while we're waiting for Miss Raspberry and her team. Yes, we have the public ground improvement questions for that. You need to give answers to DCP regarding M crown sighs. Yes, did you hear me? Yes, I did I just wanted to let you know I'm getting questions from individual attendees and panelists regarding the notification process and weather and the question around whether or not the meeting proper notification was not done and also since the plans were not received until today. Those are very valid questions and did anybody make a motion to that extent not yet and so far the individuals that have paints? This question have asked me to just broach the question with the committee: without naming anyone, okay I make a motion. I, like I'll, make a motion that we came over to get notification and documentation. Okay, we have received the presentation. The question or notification is that the immediate neighbors received notice from the applicants I do not think that's been done now, you're, putting a motion on the floor. There's Collins information with the folks of these ahead of time for us to be able to review it, not just to our correct. When would you suppose the information folks have been on committed a week in advance? Okay? So that's not happening so I'd like to make a motion that we table this because and enough time could review it and the neighbors would not know the body. Okay, I'm, just now doing account of who's on line. I did that for you miss tires and do we have a quorum? So then we need a second for Miss. Collins is motion to okay, always give you a name and sorry about business. Sarah, hi, okay! This is a motion to read to welcome to take further to the next meeting. Now we had some issues with having a regular Land Use Committee meeting in live because of the July 4th holiday. So would not be the first Thursday. It would be some day in the following week. We would not have a regular board meeting. We could probably move it to the second Thursday in July if the applicant agrees short notice and puts us at a disadvantage for being to being able to ask informed questions. So we have a second I want to call the roll question. I'm. Sorry I'm not trying to do an addendum to the to the motion. Please excuse me I'm, sorry, who is speaking Deborah Jung is speaking that question taffy Islan, okay, fine. What I'd like to share is, as the president of the Crown Heights North Association I, did entertain the thought about making a motion to not hear the applicant because of the untimely notification. However, I would ask that we reconsider that and not and allow the presenters to move forward, but we not vote on it so that we can have an opportunity to digest what is being presented so I just wanted to kind of throw that out. I do not that's an alternative to the motion, but I just wanted to interject that so I'm turning it back over to you miss chair, because I do not know how we should proceed at that point, but I wanted to share that with the person who made the motion in the second okay consideration. Yes, we do have a motion on the floor. We had second so at this point, I won't have to put it to a vote. Okay, fine, okay, so if you would call the roll on tabeling this to have them come back in July question yeah I'd like to speak to the motion: I am in agreement with MS young on this point. I do believe that we should not have a vote this evening because of notifications in the community to the neighbors not being timely, but this is a big project and a big proposal and I think it would help the members in the committee to hear the presentation from the presenters. Even if we're going to take a little later meeting, miss Collins. Do you want to withdraw your motion? No I can not, because if it's a very big project and I would think that the applicant will be bit more on the ball. Okay, let's call the roll and see what happens with the vote on the motion to table to July. It would be the second Thursday in July. Please call the roll Miss young, okay, Princess, James Collins wait a minute. No I did not hear back up to princess James. She here I do not see her, not here. Okay but I'm going to call because, just in case someone came in late after absolutely correct, okay, so Janet Collins. No, that's what you meant: okay, Fred, Frazier, okay, miss Jordan, Mazzani's, grando, no she's on Granville. Maybe she has her hand up miss Granville. What did you say? Yes, she says. Yes, you just won the second way, I told I'm. Sorry! Well, we look at me. Randall voted yes, okay, yes, okay, Sarah Lazar, yes, Robert, puka, Nora Daniel. She on Robert, puka, riddle, yeah I've been texting to a chat. He texts in What. Did he say he said yes, no see in a second Julia. Do you see anything from Mr.? Riddle I do not see anything from Carla riddle at the present time, but I do see. Six hands raised. Okay, Adam Satan Ethel tires. Yes, Boni just said: yes: okay, Erica Witherspoon, yes, okay, shower with a burn young. Yes, okay. We have one two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight nine yeses and one. No. So that means we can table it to July applicant to return the second Thursday in July, which they is, which date is July 9th same time same station, do have the Messiah I have six hands raised hair deep before moving on to M crown? Do you want to hear something? Questions? Okay, so the first on my list is Lin Yi, Yong, Lin Yi. You want you on. Thank you. Let me find them so I can meet them. I got it think. Thank you, okay, their microphone and they disappeared. Okie Dokie. So the next thing up is Myesha hunter. You want to do that. One I have a Stacy Lynn lardy. She had her hand raised next. Okay, so I wrote them down, as I saw them. Go up. Okay, Dillon arts. Your question: did you unmute her? Okay, they type out their question. Okay, this is terrible. Okay, Stacy's linen arts. What's your question? Get them to put the question in writing. Miss Lynn arts. If you could, please type your question, if at all possible that would help speed the meeting and the next one is not just Begelman I. Have you, as the third hand, raised followed by Morris a Jew me Thomas, Lewis and Misha hunter I'm I can not understand my handwriting I apologize. Ok, the attendee list is extension. Also. Once you hear your name to know that you are being called for a question, please lower your hand. It does not lower automatically. Ok we're going back so Nadja. You hear me Naja, so I'm a muting. You ask your question. We can not speak. It's ok. My questions are regarding the proposal and since we're not seeing it tonight, I will speak in July. Okay, so you can put your hand down the next person is Morris edge after me, the question is: should I be happy to talk with you, it's another time. Wait a minute. I do not get your answer, but I encourage you to try asking in the meeting. So the board knows that things are not clear from Sarah yeah I'm, sorry that was I thought it was a response to a message. Somebody sent me privately there's just some confusion among people who are not usual Community board, meeting, attendees and yeah. Maybe I do not I. Do not know you're giving them some clarity? Ok, so that was Morris as me. He's not coming forward, for whatever reason. Ok, let me ask him: what is this question? Ok, I'm going everybody I just sent to Mr. as me: Miss Tyus. Yes, there are quite a few people on this. Call that have questions and they're in the chat boxes. I do not know how we're going to respond to the community members who have come out to join it on this call. This evening, okay, given the given my late arrival, the ability to catch up one time I feel that I need to ask the forgiveness of those who voted to postpone and have MS rasberry step through the battle point presentation, and we take questions tonight and let them come back with answers in July. Does that sound, reasonable? Okay? We already voted. We all know you have a bulletproof argument. People have questions, miss Collins people, let them have the question, but that does not mean we should know you know. So we already voted well. The questions. That's another story. Some of the questions I'm seeing in the chat, is not about the proposal itself. It's about the process and trying to understand so that they could be prepared for next time and I think we owe it' smoke. Wow I have a problem with that. That's not what I heard Madam President said: I miss, maybe I misunderstood her I did not want to go to location you're right. We did a vote. Let us stand. Okay can I just ask a few of these questions. Julie, or do you want to do that? Some of them I, think are happy of that we need to be able to some people are asking where there was a question up here about they can't be seen and they do not know how to be able to ask questions. They said it's okay, the tenth chat. Attendee option is disabled. There was a question here about zoom, because you know this was been challenging. I've gotten a couple of calls that people can't get on. Let me see- and someone said, yeah I'm- a member of the community. Why is it that I can't see other attendees questions and concerns in the chat? This should be transparent and an open meeting. This should be the case. The chat you put, you pick, everyone there's a drop- down menu for the chat, and you pick everyone so that everybody gets your message. Okay, I'm trying to see if there was anything else. Thank you. So some of the attendees are saying that the attendees do not have the option of seeing all of the of being able to address all participant. So we as panelists do have the ability to message all of the participants but, and then it looks like attendees can only see the chat text from Panelist, but not from other attendees, and so this is something that could maybe be finagled with the settings for the meeting. True, okay, that's a good idea. We get do it to fix that there just follow up. There were also some questions in the chat from some of these community members who have not been to community board meetings before or until and lurks world use meetings before, and they were I think they're. Just basic questions about what has the board's role in approving or disapproving the project? Thank you yeah. Let me answer that all the attendees who are not familiar with the chat raising the hand or whatever the community boards role to advise city agencies on the services that city agency provides to the community. In this case the Landmarks Preservation Commission governs development in landmarked when landmarks and historic districts and scenic landmarks, and whatever this building this site is in a historic district that Crown Heights north face to historic districts. So landmarks has to approve the development and see that the end product will be appropriate to the historic district. They would issue a certificate of appropriateness by way of approving this project. So that's the role of the Community Board here. Are there other questions? I can answer that I'm not seeing MS, Neil or MS young I do not see any additional questions in terms of the attendees not being able to see each other and know. What's going on, the issue of transparency has been raised by a number of different people. That's not I'm, not sure that that's something that do it can address. That would definitely be a Microsoft thing since Microsoft is the creator of WebEx I'm, not even sure that held that house even broached out with do it, but I will do my best tomorrow morning. You have to tell them that if it's an open meeting, people should be able to have a free exchange within the control of the meeting leaders, the Chair Vice Chair secretary that that's available. It's the people that are not again I'm still I mean it's part of the Microsoft Office package. Now, so I really do not even know, but it's something I will. Madam chair, we're just little bit confused upon us to run through our proposal. Morris at Jemmy is available is ready to do that. He would like to speak for to the stance Thanks. Thank you, miss raspberry. What we voted on the motion was made and ii did not voted on and they were asking for the project presentation to be made at the next meeting after notice to the adjoining property made in a timely manner. We discussed that this afternoon you had some reservations about disease infection, so we talked about doing the notice by mail so a month to do that and it will take about a month. Usps is processing paper mail, so we would have that and we have a month to collect questions on the PowerPoint that you have sent around. If you receive those in advance of the July meeting, we can do that, but I did try to massage in a run- through of your PowerPoint that we sieved earlier today the day of the meeting, so it may sting, but that's where we are with that process. I apologize for whatever that's worth. Thank you. My documents, I believe Miss Collins means proof of notice to the neighbors, know that and also the whole. We have that today we have it. That's why your motion passed Miss Collins. Thank you. Thank you, miss Collins, so we're going to move on unless there's something else you want to add. I was I'd like to say one of jumping. Yes, this is something we can consider for the community in particular not the community board. I. Think in this rasberry please I'll collect me if I'm spoken, when you reached out to me on Monday, you send about meeting with us correct meetings with all interested parties. So in that email there were several block: Association presidents and individuals who lived area right. So what I say that to say that for the community as a part of Crown Heights North, once we get the plans and we digest what I would offer to the community that has organized around this project since Miss Raspberry has extended that invitation to us that, like you, come back together and allow her to present to the community or the community members, not the community board price July, that's something that we could possibly consider. I do not know if that's inappropriate, but you know you did extend that invitation, and that is something that the Crown Heights noughts Association would have ordinarily entertained when the developers come forward in the historic district and asked to make a presentation if we feel it's warranted so and I'm addressing that to the community members who took time out to come in here. This is this evening, and I mean we could talk amongst ourselves, as we often do, but that is something that I wanted to put out there. While we were still on the call yes, so I would get back to you, miss Raspberry as a part of the Crown Heights North Association. That group wants to have a meeting before the July community board meeting if they want to hear since people seem to be very disappointed, not hearing it this evening. Okay, thank you, so there there's raspberry, so then we'll reconvene on July 9th, if you would send your proof of notices to the adjoining property owners at least a week before that July 9th date, we'll come back together on zoom' and I promise to be on time. Okay, thank you. So much all right. So thank you for coming. Thank you. Mister add Jhemini. Thank you all the neighbors for coming sorry, this is a disappointment, but you now you have time to look at the plans that news raspberry put together and we can put together a you, can put together a list of questions for them based on what you have in your possession. Now you do have the plans from is Raspberry so review them please and be ready to ask and form the questions in July. Okay, everybody good! Thank you, okay! So we're going to move on to the public realm improvements. Issues remaining around M crown neighborhood, rezoning and I would ask my colleague give the cony to marshal those questions. We are looking at what we can ask city planning to include in the studies that they're doing to make sure that this neighborhood rezoning hits the mark as far as addressing needs in that six- block area. That now extends to things include the McDonald's lot that that's remarkable and for half a mile around the perimeter and Mr. Kony has listed out a neat bucket list of issues, areas that we should be concerned with. It's in your agenda. I, do not think I need to read them out, but I will so we're. Looking at public education, transportation and transit, open space density included, apartment sizes and target tenants land use. Do we want big- box stores, I, think that's a no- no by itself displacement, income target populations and resiliency and I do not see our erstwhile colleague Mr. Barack on the participant list or the attendee list. Do you see him miss Neele? He was here earlier. He was on the call okay, he was there shoot okay, so we lost him, but at any rate, I'm going to turn this over to give to organized ways to get you guys to respond to. This is Atlantic Avenue to Franklin Avenue, to Bergen Street and over two grand back down to Atlantic and then over to the McDonald's lot, which is now included in the study area. Take it away, wow thanks, I guess: I first want to say that the eight bullet points that are in the agenda are a list that I put together from questions that were already submitted. Either came up in discussion at the at the M'kraan meeting. We had an April on the 23rd or were submitted in writing by my community members, so these were really groupings and things that seemed to be important to people who had raised it in discussion in the meeting or in writing. Just as an update, we've had some discussion with City Planning with regards to an outreach strategy, the I'm sorry they're, not they're, not with us tonight, but they presented us with a very extensive outline and topics they wanted to cover in outreach sessions to the community really a kind of a whole course in City Planning. If you will, what we suggested in that meeting is that we have one monthly meeting between now and when the scope for the draft scope for the environmental review comes out, and we move kind of the topics that they had outlined for us into the framework of that one monthly meeting, because it would be extensive. It would take a lot of time for a land- use meeting and we do not see holding for all the information that they're proposing to cover. We just thought it'd be easier for them on a consistent day each month. That does not otherwise conflict with a community board meeting. So that's the that's the intention right now, there's miss town I said we're still, obviously interested in receiving input and feedback on what the scope of the multi- agency study should look like. Okay, thank you, Mr., Vu, Coney, so I do not know how many of you get a chance to go through the study area to BB zones on a fairly frequent basis. Would anybody like to speak to any of these issues now, while we're together, I, guess I'll? This is a Peter catcher speaking yeah, actually just because I see there's a really good number of participants on the on this call. I just want to submit couple suggestions. One I was at a pH and EC meeting last week and I thought you gave a relatively clear description of the different zones of M Crown and the e zoning expectations that are the target, the rough estimations of where things are going to be, and since there's no almost 60 participants on the call at this point, I think it makes sense just to give the neighbors of the in Crown Heights and specialized than many of those rights that the idea of what to what M crown is with the zoning and the second actually was about the also at the meaning, givers Marshall in this process, and he is a he mentioned. The pH and EC has approached the and had a meeting with DCP just thought, and he had they went there with an ad hoc committees. So I thought it might be helpful just to have a rough because in request, because Association is made public, but it's what is always communication I think it'd be helpful. Also, Asian you see would share what's information recipe and in third, actually I. Think there's been a request. I've made a couple of requests for what what's called the CBA for the Grand Pacific proposal. We're just wondering if we that CBA, if it's been signed, would be shared with the committee. Thank you says three things: okay, what was the first one? The first was because there's a good number of participants on the call who do not know what M crown is and because I thought that ran through I can run through the different zones of em crown with the zoning, the building heights density, the type of object very quickly, and then let me answer that before we do a train again. On the first question, M crown is laid out on the community boards website. Basically, it's a six- block area with a little extension going west towards Barclays going west towards Pacific Park. That is mainly bus, parking lots and vacant lots and a couple of really small apartment buildings, maybe six or eight units that is fairly moribund. You know car week a hair I think the funeral home, the Seelye Kyle, the funeral home is the newest piece over there. Greenpoint GM DC has a factory over here that they shared space within there we'd like to see more of that and we'd like to see a mix manufacturing, residential and manufacturing commercial and residential opportunities for working neighborhood, whoever sprinkling on their microphone. Please stop! So that's what the acronym stands for: manufacturing, commercial, residential opportunities for working neighborhood. We can put together a resolution that was passed by the board a year and a half two years ago. Now we're the full board supported this approach so that it would be with a description. I do not want to say restrictions with a idea towards narrowing what sorts of businesses we would want in there to be those businesses that would provide living wages without requiring a college degree where people could walk to work, still live in this neighborhood and make a decent living where they could support themselves. So that's question. 1 question 2. This material is available on the board's website and for question three: a copy of the CBA. We are waiting for the developer in Pacific LLC to go ahead and register and that at that point, it'll be public in the public realm and not a problem. So right now it's unique to that particular development and we want to nurture it and let it get registered before we put our finger in the pie and ruin the pie. Okay. My second question. Thank you. My second questions is Peter crashes again was that Mr. Veeck Tony's share the input that Prospect Heights neighborhood Development Council, provided to the to the to the Parma City Planning I. Think that's as I said, the North Prospect Heights Association has this communication is extremely public and when we're sharing it with a committee, so we were just asking Mr. Makoni. It's actually essentially marshaling this effort, so I think it's a reasonable request that he share the input that the Prospect Heights neighborhood development council is providing the Department City Planning thanks Tony, in fact we're not providing any input to the Department of City Planning. We did meet with the Department of City Planning and had a group that was briefed on the project. But what we've done is draft a letter to the community board which the community board is now in possession of and there's no problem with their recent okay I'm. Sorry, Mr. Crassus, that's the letter from Robert witherwax. Recently, that's correct! Okay! So that that's not an issue. If you have a copy of that letter, Mr. Falcone, can you send it to Mr. Crassus, please sure? Okay, so anything else, Mr. Crassus! Well, as we go through the items, we'll talk, Thanks, okay, so now the DCP is giving us homework. They do not have enough staff to go out and do the kind of survey that we would not want them to do to pinpoint every little thing that we want to see fixed. To put it in the budget. I know we as a community board, we submit capital expense budget needs every year, and sometimes we get back Road answers saying it's in the budget: it's in the budget. It's in the budget expect to see a lot of that coming up now that the tax revenues have dribbled off to practically nothing because nobody was working. But this is the kind of thing where it's an opportunity: if we seize it to tell DCP in detail what we would like to see. What I've put forward so far is very mundane stuff, like rebuild the steps from the sidewalk to the roadway going underneath the shuttle along Park Place plant, some more trees, a repave, X Street, and things like that. So for those of you who walk these streets, you want to put those in an email with the title. Em crown the word em crown and as the first words in the title of your email and we'll gather them up and digest them and put them in these buckets and shuffle them off to DCP. So they can include that in the work that they're going to pay for to have this study done, they themselves will not do the study and it's going to be expensive. They'll hire someone to go out and do the study and it's going to be six figures for sure. So this is an opportunity to speak up some of the issues that are forming and have not gelled our density. How do you in my mind's eye? How do you separate density from overcrowding when you have lower income populations? How do you deal with displacement and gentrification we're people who were making barely making minimum wage can't afford to live near their jobs? They have to spend money on Long, Island, Railroad or travel two hours in back and forth from home outside the city to come in and work a minimum- wage job. So these are some of the things that we may be able to tackle with some sort of positive resolution if we pay attention to this opportunity. So that's what I'm asking all of you attendees to look at as you walk around this community district point out things that are in or near that rezoning the area that's up for rezoning, so that we can get it to DCP and they can include it in their assessment to the agencies that they're working with, because they're going to work with all the city agencies. To get some of these ideas raised to the level of action, positive action on their part, anything anybody would like to add. There's Neil, you see any comments. Coming in taking the comments now, there is a procedural question: it's about Hedron, though let me ask you a question will be able to save these and retrieve these for the next meeting, chat, I can copy and paste the chat before Michelle closes out the meeting. It's not something that can be published, though, since there are private messages. Okay, but I want them. I! Can't okay I want them. We want it. We want to tease out the questions that did not get asked tonight and make sure that they brought up next time. Okay, thank you he's young. Are you there? Yes, anything in there that you see we need to address now, not there, okay, yeah Mr. Kony. Is there anything you want to add, or an M crown I wanted to say that I just pasted a link into the chat for the letter that we sent to the pH and EC said to need to be coordinated regarding him from for anybody who is interested in seeing that I appreciate that, thank you very much. Do you want to read any particular section of it to the audience? I mean it's a home: it's not it's not too long, but I do not know if it's I do not know if it's the best. You said the meeting time to actually read this: oh yeah I mean I, do not like I think everybody can read, it I mean to make sure the people were not feeling put out. I Mr. Barack is still with us, I'd like to ask him to make some comments and suggestions for the audience regarding input from the community into this opportunity for rezoning, Mr. Barack. Are you there? Yes, you hear me? Yes, okay, so a couple things at some point: City Planning is going to put together a draft zoning proposal and it will probably have four or five different zoning districts and that will be the basis for them to repair the environmental impact statement based on that scope of work and okay, a lot of opportunities, starting with the scope. Excuse me, get up turn off your microphone. I'm. Sorry, Mr. Barrett would be a lot of opportunity for the community and a community board to weigh in on the proposed zoning. That's used for the environmental analysis and that period of time, why they're doing the study as an opportunity again to try to have a dialogue regarding their proposed zoning districts before City Planning, actually certifies a plan for Euler. The ongoing thing is related to the various topics of where there could be expense, budget or capital budget opportunities again, because at a larger city budget situation, you're really more talking about a framework of things you would like to have money spent on there may be sites like the HPD parking lot that may want to be talked about. There are parks, there are school yards, three conditions, I just happen to notice you're, getting new pavement blacktop within the EM crown area. So that's maybe one less issue, but there may be. You have to think about. Are there better ways to use the open space? Do schools need expansions, can schoolyards be better utilized? These are the type of things the experience, long and leg Avenue. This is the kind of feedback that has to be ongoing. It's not explicit to how much density is proposed. These are things you would want to see. Regardless. Thank you, Mr. Bill I appreciate that I hope you'll be continuing to attend these meetings as we move forward to some actual results from all of this effort. So are there any parts of old business that we need to attend to before we begin to Adjourn I had a question: I do not know if Mr. Barek is still here easier. You just I was wondering I. Think at some point. I'd asked you before about the racial displacement reports that I believed to Monty Williams had proposed as being a future type of component to in environmental impact. Reports and I was wondering if that sort of report has been done. Yet if it's, if it's part of the environmental impact structure yet so it's not a requirement of environmental impact statements, whether that changes before this document would be prepared. That's another story. A lot of times lawsuits affect how environmental impact statements modify their requirements. I have not seen to date whether the council could put forth legislation. That would change that. That's something I guess can be determined, but remember that E is, are merely disclosure documents, so the whether there was a direct analysis or not there's other ways to get that information out there and again it's a bottom line is whether the City Council feels even if there was some sense of disclosure and even without a sense of disclosure. If the council had a certain sense of what's going to happen to the neighborhood might that affect how they want to accept or modify the rezoning proposal, or are there other resources of the city that the council may try to leverage to try to minimize that kind of effect on your neighborhood Thank You Mr. Barrett, quick, go ahead. That's all I just wanted to add that we had a. We had a zoom with his city planning folks last week, where they presented a very detailed demographic analysis of the study area for M Brown. So they actually have done that analysis. We asked them to present it to this meeting to the Land Use Committee I may be in with, but not necessarily all of it, because it was quite lengthy, but there was a lot of stuff that was very informative and it would be very good for this committee to see and the trends that it shows do you indicate substantial displacement, particularly by income and race over the last 10 years in the study area, and it's something I hope that they'll be able to present the future land- use did not even you think, maybe next month, I agree with you 100%. It was very illuminating, but it's not something that was hidden. The question I think I hear people like Dr. Lazaar Asking is how do we manage the negative effects displacement? Your microphone if your rustling stuff around near the microphone folks? So we need to be able to manage that in a way that we got the results that we want. So what are the tools that we have I believe they are largely state property tax credits where people who have the wherewithal to build are encouraged to build and rent at rates that folks can afford on a on a living wage level. So I have to turn it back over to Mr. Beer Rack to speak to that in a more imaginative way, because I know Borough Hall is looking at it closely. It's a very knotty problem. Mr. Baer I can have any suggestions to it for how yeah well, first of all, we'll be mih options that, although you can't specify one option having the two options that gives you the best chance of giving people in a community an opportunity to have affordable housing. So it's you're not necessarily gaining new, affordable units in a community. If people in the community are winning the lottery and the units they vacated tend to go to higher rent, especially for coming out of stabilized units where landlords you know, even though the rules changed a little bit, rents will still go up somewhat, and then you still have a lot of homeownership units in a neighborhood. So if the person moved out of a homeownership unit into this affordable unit, there's no guarantees of what happens with the non- regulated unit in terms of what the next rent is going to be. So it's a balancing act. It's how you can help people who, if you do not produce this housing in the M'kraan area, you're going to lose them anyhow, potentially, so how much of this is giving them a chance to win the lottery? One of the problems with the lottery is the income. Bands are very narrow, and one of the position to borough president has tried to modify is to say if you're, a rent burdened household and the rent in the lottery is less than what you paid today, but you're still going to be rent burdened, just less rent burden right, you're going to have more cash for food right now. The lottery does allow you that opportunity to win the unit, even though it would reduce your rent so wanted a policies to borrow presidents been trying to push for there's a change so that, even though you'll win a unit and you'll still be rent bird and you're still going to pay less rent. So that's something we're hoping City, Planning and council would decide, is a worthy goal, because that will allow a lot more people to have success in qualifying for the lottery. The other things are going to be the strategies that the city is already implemented elsewhere. In terms of how can you help people stay in their apartments? So, for example, the housing court representation? Would you be one of the zip codes? That's automatic if you're, not one of those zip codes, your income has to be fairly low to have a chance to get that service so that that's been an issue in some communities and you know helping people really with resources or organizers to help people know their rights to best combat displacement, pressures and you're, going to limit limited opportunity on other city-, owned properties. I know the council Lanyu staffers work with councilmember combo to try to identify, affordable housing opportunities in a creative way. You know: is there a one story, library, child care center, where, if you rebuild it with also affordable housing? Because beyond that, you have the HPD lot I share with the community board. At the other end of the district on a Nitra property, there is intent to have senior housing developed, affordable senior, but there's really not a lot of properties to try to create affordable housing opportunities. So on the city sites you could try to push for more goals than you can for the Mah sites. Let me yes if there would be any opportunity to push for legislation that modifies mih to be more productive of affordable housing. Deeply, affordable housing is that is that a possibility? What would it take I do not think City Planning would be looking to modify the mih classifications. However, they could modify the zoning text to not preclude the rent burdened households. The other problem is that the state method of 421a that the new equivalent, affordable, New York, is based on units. The Mih for the city is based on floor area. So if we wanted developers to build larger, more bedrooms for the affordable housing and it contradicts the state methodology, so one possibility to try to better align that if the mission is more family are not the affordable units. Next time the state looks at renewing the 421a to have them match the city formula for floor area as opposed to units. If the developer want to do a lot of one bedrooms and studios to market rate, that's one thing, but then the state formula, basically forcing developers to mimic that. Thank you any other questions. Complaints. This is Kathy, Islan I have a question. This Tyus, yes, I'm, not sure I understood a reference that Mr. Barack made before when he was talking about things. We ought to be looking and considering when we're talking about the M'kraan zone- and you said something about an HPD parking lot and not can you clarify? Is that the HPD parking lot that's on Dean Street? So why is that something we're talking about when that's not in the footprint of em crown? Why is that something we should be considering, as in the realm of the M Crown zone, improvements and development and desirable things, and can you explain that so you're really looking at your larger community, not just simply the blocks of the rezoning that there are blocks beyond them, crown where there are opportunities for community improvement, so the HPD lot becomes an opportunity to determine whether it becomes housing. I know some years back, people thought well. Could it be a little bit more park land if it's all housing or partial housing, for who you know what incomes, what bedroom types should it be? A support of population elderly? You know, so you can use the uncrowned dialogue in meeting with the agencies that City Planning facilitates you with to go well beyond the uncrowned footprint, finding open space and creative ways. Sometimes it's putting lights on parks. Sometimes it's putting softer surfaces down instead of astroturf. Sometimes it's turning school yards into after- hours playground. So these things exist outside of the uncrowned footprint and the population. That's going to move into em crown it's going to network within the community outside of that footprint, the child care senior centers, the schools they're all outside the footprint, so everything really is in play. Now, where exactly is this parking lot? Mrs.' ln? It's on Dean Street between 6Th, Avenue and Carlton, there's an Asian bergen's between 6Th Avenue and Carlton. Ok and my memory living we were living using my fingers and toes a mile is 20 sending city blocks. So, if we're looking at public realm improvements within a half of my of the periphery of em Crown, then we're looking at ten blocks around the outside of em crown. Okay I mean we I think in fact it was North Prospect Heights Association in our last meeting, when our concerns were read into the record, and you gave great time to answer, you know, have Mr. Burke and yourself answer some of our questions and concerns. We were the ones who brought up the issue of the fact that the M'kraan zone is going to impact all of the neighborhoods around the M'kraan zone. So I understand that concept, and you know schools and parks and open space, and all of that I just was wanted to clarify what Mr. Eric said about. That would be part of the conversation and so that we're we stay abreast of that and because we've got it, we've got a half a mile. A ten city blocks sounds like this. Parking lot is within that yeah, but and it's up to you as a community and a community board to decide what the conversation should be and take it to whatever scope you think appropriate and the city may be totally responsive. They may have reasons to modify, but because it's your community rather than having them, come to you with the ideas it's great if it can formulate from the community so City Planning can certainly show you examples of improvements to help. You visualize our your community to get improvements. There'll be a lot of images from what they're finishing out in East New York along Atlantic Avenue, so looking at what they did there, you may see along sidewalks what are called rain gardens or some people on bioswales know. You can see how people have improved parks and see. Well. Does that make sense? It does certainly a lot of examples crossings at the street there, the sidewalks, should kind of pop out more into the street. We've done that in several places out to borrow make it easier to cross. So, looking literally anything that comes to mind, that would help improve the neighborhood I think should be brought to the attention from people who live in a neighborhood. So this is a peter crashes, speaking Miss America. So just two and I believe since the last meeting, the Land Use Committee, the North Prospect Heights Association, did send a note in Kathy may be able to correct me, but I think it was to the department, City Planning, asking them to identify potential places where new office space could be created because I think you know knowing the neighborhood as we do and walking around. We do not see very many city- owned Lots that might be available for a creating open space and a you know, keeping in mind just for those who are listening from who are too familiar with the project that because we're because it's a manufacturing, quiet, large of manufacturing zone, that's being a transform. The usual infrastructure that exists in residential neighborhoods does not exist, so you do not have parks, schools, those kinds of things so the community. Now this would be the moment, unlike any other, who is the only one to act quickly and if there's available, city- owned property to transform into open space and if there's actually a willingness from the borough president and the City Council member and the Community Board and the mayor to support the idea that open space gets transformed that property owned by the city gets transformed into a park or a playground. This would be the moment for us all to highlight that and let them let them know that this potential exists. So we did ask if there were any other options. We know that this HPD lot adjacent to being playground exists and D playground is certainly very close to the district, so I mean any suggestions you have for how could close the connection for HPD, Department, City, Planning and others just so that there could be an expansion of the playground into the into the into the into the parking lot would be helpful and we did send that letter. I just want to second what Peter said me sent a letter to your office and I think to Miss Tyus and the board as well about helping us identify opportunities for open space in the project. So let me just remind folks that the Land Use Committee did do a survey of government- owned Lots in the area and possibly we need to do a full- court press on Lots that we identify and see what progress we can make that way. So I'm making a note to myself to send that out to you guys. So we can agree on a in- house method to resurface that again to the Department of citywide administrative services and convinced them to do what Peter is suggesting to some extent. I do not know if any of you guys remember that, but it was a number of people, including Miss Collins and as purko who's currently on leave, and there was a third person who worked with Miss Collins. Who was the third person that worked with you on that survey? Miss Collins. Are you there I'm here? That was done pretty good game. Thank you yeah. So we have that survey, data and I'll send that out I'll post it to the land, use Google, Group you're, not going to see a lot of opportunities, but obviously the HPD lot could be a dialogue about open space again schoolyards, so identifying schools that perhaps, if they're opened up more hours or if parks had different equipment, could they provide for more people or more children? And then, like you, have a few different spots where you may have triangulation of the street, where there may be little traffic Islands. If some of the adjacent pavement became, let's say more of sidewalk and areas that people consider. Why not? You can look at those things on where perhaps the roadways could be narrowed, that those are the type of things that are not tremendously hard to do and DOD has send Minissha T'v that they've done, where the grids a little irregular and they've taken advantage of those conditions. So, for example, the way Rogers and Bedford come together around Dean. Could there be a chance to create a little bit of open space Haven there, those effective things that are easier to look at? Thank you, okay, so now I believe there may have been a discussion going on before I arrived in the meeting late. Is there something that I interrupted that should be picked up on? No, there was not, but before you close I would like to say something, but it's not necessary. It's not related to impound and it's not related to him. Crying I put my hand up and finish my statement and then you Mr. Todd, no I'm going to wait until that's all I want to be at the end. Please thank you. Okay, go ahead. Mr., Todd, yeah it'd be a lot of talk about city- owned land and we know that there's very little land, let's face it, I mean I, think they're low- hanging fruit. Here, it's simply rejiggering the zone, the M1 Zone II a lot of hazard uses that could be done if the zoning was desert. Ordinance atoning text was changed and that's going to create, if enacted, three composting and recycling centers in every community board, and this would be an ideal location for such a facility. It could be done that's right now. This company is mute about this whole topic. They allow you no tanning and glue factories for making horse glue, but they do not talk about composting machines and recycling, etc. So I think there's a huge opportunity here to use a lot of that unused space or, as you probably notice, mayor I, should say just cancel all of the curbside pickup organics, and this is creating huge pushback for a program that costs a mere twenty four million dollars and a nine billion dollar shortfall. All of this is say, I think, there's an opportunity here. Perhaps the borough president staff or someone could look at the possibility of amending a zoning ordinance to allow some of these new opportunities to be done as a private. We do not require any legislation once it's been done. Okay, I'm going to have to ask Mr. Bertoni to just briefly step through the community board signed on to what's the resolution for the target uses that we quote unquote prefer for the rezoning of that. That's that small segment that we're talking about Mr. Falcone, yes, I- can do that I think it'd be a little bit. Might go a little quicker well, I do not have that. I have another piece of slide where, with all of the not the one with all of the uses, but we basically broke down the area. We're concerned about four uses are the side streets of the MX sub zones in the in crown recently framework, so those are Pacific Street between Grand Avenue and Placid Avenue and the in streets between Grand, Avenue and Class and Avenue, and the idea there is to have businesses that are non- retail and non- residential and non- retail of non hospitality, in other words, businesses where either something is made or some type of service is provided or some other some other type of non- commercial non office. Work is done so and in the logic they're throwing back to find the beginning. The infinitive is that we need to create a diverse mix of employment opportunities for the people who live in community district 8. We want to have not only commercial and office employment opportunities, but we have want to have opportunities that are accessible to people who do not have a college degree. So, broadly speaking, those for the uses that we're seeking for the side streets in the MX sub zone in M Crown and we're interested in seeing if we can get incentives to preference those uses in the end in the manufacturing zones. We won't Brown as well. Thank you Mr. Vic, Oney, okay. So where are we on this I? Think? The sticking point for me is organizing this Q&A to get information out of our community residents, who see what see the problems but do not report them or I. Do not know exactly how to say this, but we need to translate those casual observations into something that would be useful for City Planning to put in that space other than bus parking, lots and junkyards. So I do not know how much more to say about it. Unless there are some techniques that Mr. Barrett can share with us in his land use planning, training and experience. What would be a good way? Some of the things that DCP has suggested is doing a large meeting where they put up maps and they ask people to come over and pin ideas to a particular location. On the map, I think they did that with a couple of other rezoning--zz that they were planning and it was. It became unwieldy if I, if I, remember correctly, that their feeling about that approach, so but it can be tweaked we'd all be together. We can have breakout sessions where people took one of these buckets and sat and said. Well, we think we should have this open space there, just as Kathy just said. Look at that. What can we do with these vacant lots and what Peter's asking? Where can we find more open space? So I'm not quite sure how to do this and we're I'm casting about for suggestions from you guys were not you talking about a monthly meeting did not get mentioned. Some things Kathy, I'm, sorry, Kathy, Islan I- do not want the same kind of same kind of arm- waving to happen at the monthly meetings we have to I think we should come up with a organized way of researching these areas. If people want to take off fighting off a particular segment and work on it and come back with a report. Just as the members, the three members of the Land Use Committee did with the government- owned sites, they did an excellent job. They came back with ownership, data, location and size, etc. So it's that kind of input that we, as a committee, have to put out if we expect the experts that we're going to turn that information over to give us back something that used more useful than if we do not do something like that. This is a Peter cratchit speaking. I would volunteered to if this makes sense to take on the idea of looking at the list that was drawn up by CBA and I'm, even doing a little proofing of it and then I'm, seeing Wok, City, city- owned lots or governor lots like that. We can identify that would be available for open space. It also like to volunteer to maybe do a little research on school capacity. I think it makes sense for the committee to take a look at the available capacity in the existing local schools for this kind of a proposal, so we probably have that somewhere would be great. This would be a way to act like it'd, be great if it exists that I'm just offering to pull together the info that I can find and continue working on. This is going to be at a month by month basis. Okay I think we have theirs Wedderburn on the line she could probably get something I probably will have hat will have the opportunity to have access to the data and I proposed in regards to school. That I will be the recipient of the data to be discussed. If that is an ongoing concern as to what kinds of schools we all will have in that district and around the district, oh there's wet burn is definitely going to be something we should feed to City Planning, not that they can't get it on their own. But as I was saying earlier, misunderstanding this time right go ahead. No, you misunderstand me: that's what I'm saying go ahead! I'm, sorry, one of the things that we're working on and has been delayed with school Construction Authority and the we is the Education Committee and community for Community, Education, Council, 13, I'm, sorry, I'm, just the end of it. We want to give data to City Planning, as I said, can we meaning this Community Education Council number 13, which is has oversight over that area, as well as the community board are in the midst of teasing out that data? Now you have access to information such that I would be prefer that I take the lead in this, so we can submit it to City, Planning, absolutely and I hope that it will be part of the joint discussion on M crown. Yes, ma'am. Okay, that sounds good, so that's a date on seats, new seats coming in or Peter there's plenty of data overall in thirteen, as well as a discussion as to what the needs are that will serve thirteen and therefore serve the M crown area. Okay, this is a Peterson I'm, happy to support, Sharon and listen, and if she needs some help and I think she's referring to the school capacity data which the part of Education publishes every year and that's a really good resource for looking at available seats in you know in the area. Okay, so this is good I. Thank you. Both I just want to add that a lot of the schools now are accommodating homeless population and it's hard to say how many of the schools are having fairly local homeless versus kids traveling far away, so some of the schools that have very high capacity, it's not because from the local population, there's information that we often put together when we briefed the borough president in terms of what schools have a significant percentage. Some schools have twenty thirty percent of the kids actually coming from these shelter facilities, which may or may not be local. Kids. That's why I wanted to participate. I'd love to cooperate with you on that Mr. Barrett, but the Community Education Council is very much aware of those in disease, especially in the guys yeah. We could easily pull data for particular schools if you wanted us to do that, it's a pretty easy task for us. Thank you, okay. So it sounds like the youth and Education Committee is tied closely to the data that they need to adequately plan for any additional seats that would be needed, as crown comes online and turns from big watts into residences in general. The prognostication is that we could get approximately 400 Reid 400,500 dwelling units from different sites in the in the area to be zoned as private property owners come in and build am I, correct, Mr., Vieau, kony, yeah I. Think our analysis is about 550, so by 50 total. All right, so I do not know how you not the total number. That's the affordable number. Let me come back a few just a second Welling units, so I do not know how you pull a number of how you plan for a number of school seats with that kind of nebulous datum is what a bird you got any corners for us on. That authority actually very helpful. Actually, the I think the exact ratio is public. They actually have like a formula on line in that district as well. There is a formula, but there is their different methods by which they're addressing the capacity needs both present and projected. So this is a really great way for us to really get educated about it by dispelling all this out and putting the numbers where we need to put them. So that's sure it's going to be great to see this info and I'm again not offering to help you just coming back to the number of units projected or this is our bulk analysis, not City. Planning spark analysis. The total number is 2121, with 1591 being market rate in 530, affordable, I'm. Sorry I asked him to repeat those numbers again. Our projection is with the build- out with the expected build- out in and crown the total number of new units. I knew equal units would be 2120, one of those 1591 or market rate and 530 are affordable. Those numbers do not include the lots that have already been through their own private Euler process, so 1050 Pacific and Pacific in Grand Pacific are not in those numbers. Their units are in addition to that Thank, You, Mr., Volpone I, just want to add that when City Planning does the environmental impact statement, whether it's those exact numbers, what they're going to do is they're going to take the known buildings that are supposed to happen with or without the rezoning, such as some of the few that went through the EM crown area already they'll make that part of the Baseline condition project school needs, combined also with a general growth factor that they're going to assume and then they'll project based on a new units they'll plug in a number. It's a set number, it's the same number for every environmental document, and so you, if you knew you're getting about 2100 units- and you add the couple hundred units from the other approvals you could plug in that number like now and know how many projected elementary middle school and high school students that the study would likely disclose, say eight months from now and again, this is like assuming a ten- year. Build- out, not all the units are clearly going to come online at once. Some units could be in year. Two five: you know it's going to over time: I have a question: I mean if the. If the reports and the studies are going, I have a sort of like ten year perspective. Is the change in I? Guess I'm wondering about what's going on right now and I'm wondering because you know the state is broken down, for example, deaths from Covid-19 by County, but I do not know if there's data being collected on how many people have died by a community district and also there have been a lot of people who have just left the city. I do not know if you know from the City Planning perspectives that assume to be a temporary kind of change or I do not know. Maybe I'm not I'm having trouble coming up with the right way to formulate this question, but is like all right are the like exodus from the neighborhood going to be factored into this type of these types of projections, or is there just no way to do so likely not probably going to use fairly recent, and they have this thing called neighbor, Housing, Survey, community, housing? Sorry I think it's called that helps them figure out baseline calculation and they're not going to really get into the nuance of how things have changed in a various community because of the Covid-19. Obviously, some people have second home, so they're, not a neighbor now but long- term they're back people who have passed away in the neighborhood is it is the person who died, the entire household or is the household still there anyhow, and therefore no one's moving in, because the household is still they are functioning with one less person, so I think those going to be subtle, they're not really going to be discussed too much in the study. I, guess, I, wonder. People have also been talking a lot about how the structure of the school year might change based on some of this and the way that the way that classes are broken up or the way that class size is determined and I do not know. If the assumption is again that schools are going to go back to operating how they did before the pandemic or if there's or if the city is thinking that the operation of our public schools has to change, I mean I. Imagine that there would be effects on space and the how exactly you a lot these spaces for each child I do not know. Is there? Is there any ongoing school utilization aka the Blue Book for schools and I'm sure the do we, as part of the opening up plan, is going to be taking a look at that, but remember that's going to change and change again we're talking about a ten year build- out so unlikely of what goes on vaccinations happen and while there may be short term crisis, is dealing with getting schools properly social distance for an EM crown study, you're going to be looking where you're going to assume things are pretty much back to the way they were Thank, You, Mr. Barrow. Thank you, ms. What a burn! We are working with a lot of uncertainty at this time, so it's very difficult, but city planning is being encouraging by saying: let's continue to gather the data and as time passes, the euler process will be permitted by the City Council again, we probably are looking at sometime in the spring if we do not have another surge of infections from all of these demonstrations that are going on with a few people wearing masks and everything. So that's one aspect so I want to make sure we're covering as much of this as possible. Now is there anything else on any suggestions on how we can approach gathering ideas of public realm improvements for City Planning? You know Ethel I, wanted to suggest I know from our last discussion when Tasha and Brian were involved in the meeting with the DCP is the City Council land- use office and the councilmembers office I've actually done quite a bit of work, identifying potential community improvements to be associated with this project so I they had started to compile kind of an interesting list and I think we should invite them to the next meeting and see if they can share some of their thoughts with us, because I, at least for me, when I read that it opened it opened my mind up to thinking about things. There were other than the things that we you know that we can talk about in the committee excellent idea. Yes, we should do that. I agree with you anything now we're next. The next M Crown told her meeting we're looking at not taking time from land use, because our next land use meeting will probably be all of the Hebron project. It'll take up the entire hour and a half two hours so and it'll go on through the summer. The I would bring forth bring forward. The idea that it will go back to having a ground stakeholder meetings was it the third week of the month, again separately from land- use. We I think we're proposing to DCP the fourth Wednesday of the month, okay, and that would be online, probably using WebEx as well just so we keep the record straight. Fourth, Wednesday and we'd invite you guys to the open meeting, just like the rest of it, so we'll be doing that to try and gather the information to keep the project moving forward and be ready to start the scoping and the study and then open up Euler. Once the mayor decides to lift the mayor and the council to lift the prohibition on Euler for now. Yes speaking, this is Cathy is on. So is that the fourth Wednesday of June or the fourth Wednesday of July? When would that be starting? We plan for June or July well, I think this is still I, think it it'd be good to start in June. It's still subject to confirmation and City Planning, but it starts in June and it will be June 24, okay, all right! So that's the stakeholders- and these are people who own property in that area. We want to keep them on board with this I'm sorry to interrupt, but this is this is really sort of DCPS we as well, so it's a general I mean it's a meeting for any community members. I was about to say that thank you. I appreciate that go ahead. These are the meetings that I mentioned before, where they have kind of a whole, syllabus and stuff that they want to present feeling their way along. I, see a hand up. Is that your hand up Sharon and then Geri, Ann, Scott, hello, I, do not undo people okay nobody's getting unmuted here. I do not understand this. You Sharon, you want to put your chair and you were speaking before. I do not know why you're muted now Sharon I found I found my unmute myself. Okay, then there's Jay. You wanted to say something with no, yes, no okay, Jerry Ann, Scott unmute! You can you put your yes I. Do not think she's on there I see her yeah. She was on for the arms she's, a community member. She was on for the Hubble project ready for me. Yet, oh, you finished yeah just go ahead: okay, all righty! Okay, what I have to say it's going to be very brief: it's not specific to M crown, but I did want to bring it forward, and that is there was a request made to get a copy of the note. The chats I'm concerned about that because again I'm, not a tech person but I. If I sent a private chat message, I do not want it to become public science. I know, I, believe and I could be mistaken that it's Neil mentioned something about it, the chats being that there was some private chat and you said that you wanted it. You wanted it, but I do not think that that's appropriate, so I do not know how private chats can be deleted. I have no problem with anything else. That's relative relate to the request. You know for the project, but I do not want my private check sent to you or anybody else it was private could be teased out, but I have an objection to that. I hear you and what I'm? Trying to gather from looking getting the chats is questions that should be gleaned and put in these different buckets and go to City Planning I thought I said that when I asked miss Neal for the chats believe me, I have no problem ignoring stuff. That does not help. If you hear well I'm passing Naurang I do not want you to have it if I send a private, so maybe it will show up. Let me add Millenial now what we want the live, so it's clear to everybody miss Neal, okay, you know. Let me yes, miss Neal. Is she still with us miss Neal here? Okay, can you check with do it on whether or not the private chat show up when you glean all the chats of print all the chats and if they do, then we won't do that, because we have a reservation on the privacy issue. Peter crashes, just to I'm, not I, think this is a legal question. I do not know the answer to it, but it seems that this is a public meeting and the chats as part of that public meeting and I appreciate that this is a new technology and we're learning it so I do not know the answer this, but before things are deleted, I'd just recommend that we check to make sure that that's actually allowable, because I think you do not want to, on the other hand, delete things that were meant or made public and there's some people you do not have I mean we've already heard people who do not have microphones at work. You know I, think you're. This is a new technology with actually more ways for people to get input and then just speaking so I'm just saying that I think there's a legal question as a public there's, a public meeting, that's being docume- I'm, not sure that things can be erased. I do not know. I do not know the answer. Well, what I would say to that is that if once Miss Neele finds out- and we have a responsibility to- let people know that if you think you send in something private, it won't be private, there's a possibility. Oh. Was it private, after all, a good statement for the start of the started? Thank you, Mrs. Janet Collins speaking next week, oh I'd like to I'd like to also chime in on that and I think that Debra Young is 100% because the word write it means no enough supposed to see it and the technology and I know you were going to check it out. But I just want to say this, and the technology is using. That word private, so not likely believing anything that going for the public, but this was private chat, but anyway, I just wanted to chime in on that I think she's, 100%, correct, you've said it twice, and we I hear you clearly. Okay and I. Do they ask for Mrs. Neele to check with the experts on this the grant tour, New, York, City Department of Information and telecommunications and technology? Do it set it up so that the community boards use WebEx so they're the experts on this and city staff city employees will interface with other city employees and let us volunteers and community residents know what the fine points are on, how we use this technology and what's open and what's closed and what's private and what's public so we'll have that information going forward and we will make sure that people are aware if their chats, that are listed as from one person to another and not to the entire group of attendees s, private are really private or not. Okay, as Ms Neal said, I think she said that when the session closes, all that stuff is deleted. Is that correct missile I'm not sure about how the chats are I've, never looked to see if they're saved, like the recording is I've, always just for the sake of simplicity, copied and pasted? Whatever chat is available on my screen? Okay, so that's my person I just want to say that I have used the free WebEx in the past. This is the I call it the advanced upper Echelon one, since this is the one that the city contracted with to get. There might be some additional features, that's not available in the free ones. I really do not I do not know. I can't I. Can't I can't answer that question, but could you find out for us so people have a higher level of comfort, not a problem. I can definitely contact I rep it in the morning to see what the functionality is. Thank you thank you for bringing that up. If, unless there's anything else, I want to start to close he's going to say one thing: sorry I want to start to close by apologizing for being late number one and secondly, for coming in like a bull in a China shop when I did get in and taking over. The meeting. I did get a complaint about that, but I wanted I did not know what was going on before, and I saw the from the applicant starting a long term process of going through the PowerPoint and I'm I can guarantee you most of the people that were on the line. Did not have a chance to read that seventy five page document, since it was published this afternoon, I thought I if I may finish, I'm sorry when I came in and saw that that's what was going on. I asked for the motion that I asked for and then I was ruled bound from that point to go forward. So if people feel that I was rude, I guess I need to apologize, but I was not able to get in on time and set the groundwork for what was going to go forward because the applicant and I discussed what the likely possibility would be for them not timely doing what they the two things they were supposed to. Do. One notify the immediate neighbors to meet with the neighborhood group be well before the meeting. So that's the way that happened and for the third time I apologize. Yes, what I'd like to say is that I think you are fortunate that you had a group of people Community board members who realized that there was a problem and we tried to step up and keep it moving so that we did not have the applicant and visitors just hanging out. So we did try to move it forward. So should that happen in the in the future, because anything could happen with modern technology that what I would suggest not just to you but to any chair that finds themself with that is before you come in, like you said a bull in the China shop that you can communicate via text or ask a question just so you could pick up and not you know we'd not have that happen because we did try to you know. We did say that you were having some technical difficulties, but we did not want to just keep people hanging out. So we tried to cover and do what we thought was best to keep it moving. So we were, we were doing I, think decently and your absence but I, sorry that you had that challenge. I'm done in more ways than one I'm when I'm, what I meant by that I'm just tired a long day. Okay, is there anything else wishing to Adjourn second meetings adjourned? Thank you all for coming good nice. All right! Thank you, my president and everybody else tonight.
