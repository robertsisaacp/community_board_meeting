I keep the chickens at Imani community garden at Diamond If I know we're not supposed to have a committee assignments ready yet, but land use is something that I'm very interested in Crown Heights That in public safety, or issues that I'm pretty interested to get and involved in professionally I work for the New York City independent budget office city agency was one of my favorite agencies.
This is a community meeting, It's open to the public, and your you've got good standing to be to attend and contribute to the design action items we have for tonight or two items for the Executive Committee of resolutions were continuing business about a process for membership, recognition, slack and land use.
So We start with the resolution This resolution is to confirm the authority of the State Liquor Authority and sidewalk, cafe, review committee slack and the land use committee to work to act for the full board and it's been circulated to the board members and I'm reading it as we go now in recognition of the suspension of the interest and meeting requirement of article 7 of the public officers law included in the governor's executive order , 2-0 2.1 issued march 12 2020, the committee discussed confirming authority of the slacking land use committees to act for the full board until regular meetings begin again.
The committee approve the concept and the language now presented for affirmation at this world board meeting is as follows, whereas the current state of emergency and the restrictions on in-person meetings implemented by EO 2-0 2.1, to prevent the spread of the deadly Kobuk 19 virus have made regular full board meetings impossible and whereas two committees with regular adjudicatory responsibilities, the SLA, sidewalk, SLA and sidewalk review or cafe, review and land use committees continue to hold virtual meetings to give the board the opportunity to respond to applications that have been submitted.
The mayor just issued a statement offering $3,000 to run food restaurants throughout the city to help them stay open, So on the local level we have help coming in As. You know: Governor Cuomo has set certain restrictions on people being evicted and people not being held to task for payments, so Miss Tyus I apologize but we're having some feedback So. If there are no more questions on this proposed resolution, I would ask for a motion on it.
The executive committee accordingly is through this meeting this evening is recommending net she'd be removed based on non-attendance We, sent her a written letter, and we followed up with the email that we have on record from her Julian ale Community Coordinator at community We, don't like taking volunteers off of a volunteer organization, but we need to manage our quorum numbers and if we have people who just aren't going to show that makes it harder a harder burden to bear for the rest of us.
So she could be coming her to come to the meetings, because all the information is on the community boards website and as mr Weatherwax with mr witherwax said, we have to have a majority of the members present to do business.
I would ask that the board support the recommendation of the executive committee, as laid out by the facts of when the record to remove miss Coe Is there, a second one?
They may have some information there or one familiar with, and please do that and also respond to the census, something So everything is closed down, they're working, they're doing stuff inside, but everything else or the program stuff has been placed on hold of course, but you know it thinks something happened during this summer, I would kind of out let the community board know when they start opening up and doing all the other projects As. You know the capital projects had probably been on hold, because construction has been placed on hold until last week.
I just want to say that I know that we may have not may not have an option, but there were a lot of complaints from the community members who felt that they were not welcomed and accepted and able to participate in and the last land use meeting because of the difficulties in the challenges.
There are two committees that meet over the summer: That's the State Liquor Authority sidewalk, cafe, review committee so and those dates will be posted on the community board calendar a website and will, of course be using a virtual meeting platform.
Now I would like to still be a part of the youth and education committee and I think if the summer committees need folks I'm willing to participate on slack during this time, but I don't work for the New York City Department of Education in the office of safety and development as a social, we're becoming fearsome We're gonna have a really fearsome community board here.
Very comfortable and adroit with using this new platform, because it's not over ditto for the casual community board meeting attendees who come for one-shot projects, and so we need to work on that because that's not gonna be over Please take a moment to read the newsletter.
