It's open to the public, and your you've got good standing to be to attend and contribute to the design action items we have for tonight or two items for the Executive Committee of resolutions were continuing business about a process for membership, recognition, slack and land use.
This resolution is to confirm the authority of the State Liquor Authority and Sidewalk Cafe Review Committee Slack and the land Use Committee, to work to act for the full board.
It's been circulated to the board members and I'm reading it as we go now in recognition of the suspension of the interest and meeting requirement of article 7 of the public officers law included in the governor's executive order, 2- 0 2.1 issued March 12 2020.
The committee, approve the concept and the language now presented for affirmation at this World Board meeting is as follows, whereas the current state of emergency and the restrictions on in- person, meetings implemented by EO, 2- 0 2.1, to prevent the spread of the deadly Kobuk 19 virus have made regular full board meetings impossible and whereas two committees with regular adjudicatory responsibilities, the SLA, sidewalk, SLA and sidewalk review or cafe, review and land use committees continue to hold virtual meetings to give the board the opportunity to respond to applications that have been submitted.
Having met, March, April and May, with June meetings scheduled and whereas all committees, with Duda Kotori responsibilities, either currently or arising, acquire the affirmation of the full board for the authority exercised thus far during 2020, as well as authorization to continue to act to the full board.
That the full membership body of community Board a grants executive authority to any committee with an adjudicatory responsibilities during a state of emergency, notwithstanding any associated technological impediments that prevent a forum and whenever the full board is not scheduled to meet.

So continuing on with our report of applications approved new applications for cafe in Annie at 105, Kingston, Avenue and 755 Dean Street a full license with live music and no outdoor space.
