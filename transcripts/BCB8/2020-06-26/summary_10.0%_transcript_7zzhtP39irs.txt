Second I am the president of the Crown Heights of North, Association and Third, and not necessarily in that order of priority What I'd like to share with everyone is that Crown Heights North started reaching out to the her bronze school dating back to 2004 intent, Was to work with them to help them meet whatever goals that they were trying to achieve for themselves in terms of the building on Park Place, the school that is, we were not successful in any of our outreach efforts dating back to 2004 coming forward.
I did request that you send them to us, because we have a process that we go through to come to a meeting with a project of this magnitude and look at the plans, the plants just now.
It was our intention to send you the first draft to the Community Board on Friday, and so we did not realize that did not happen until today, I submitted names to the host of a handful of people.
Somebody sent me privately there's just some confusion among people who are not usual Community board, meeting, attendees There are quite a few people on this.
This evening, okay, given the given my late arrival, the ability to catch up one time, I feel that I need to ask the forgiveness of those who voted to postpone and have MS rasberry step through the battle point presentation, and we take questions tonight and let them come back with answers in July.
It's the people that are not again What we voted on the motion was made and ii did not voted on And they were asking for the project presentation to be made at the next meeting after notice to the adjoining property made in a timely manner.
So in that email there were several block: Association presidents and individuals who lived area What I say that to say that for the community as a part of Crown Heights North, once we get the plans and we digest what I would offer to the community that has organized around this project.
Since Miss Raspberry has extended that invitation to us that, like you, come back together and allow her to present to the community or the community members, not the community board price July, that's something that we could possibly consider.
Remaining around M crown neighborhood, rezoning We are looking at what we can ask city planning to include in the studies that they're doing to make sure that this neighborhood rezoning hits the mark as far as addressing needs in that six- block.
Sorry they're, not they're, not with us tonight, but they presented us with a very extensive outline and topics they wanted to cover in outreach sessions to the community really a kind of a whole course in City Planning.
And I thought you gave a relatively clear description of the different zones of M Crown and the e zoning expectations that are the target, , almost 60 participants on the call at this point, I think it makes sense just to give the neighbors of the in Crown Heights and specialized than many of those rights that the idea of what to what M crown is with the zoning and the second actually was about the also at the meaning, givers Marshall in this process, and he is a he mentioned.
This effort, so I think it's a reasonable request that he share the input that the Prospect Heights neighborhood development council is providing the Department City Planning Tony We did meet with the Department of City Planning and had a group that was briefed on the project.
We're people who were making barely making minimum wage They have to spend money on Long, Island, Railroad or travel two hours in back and forth from home outside the city to come in and work a minimum- wage, job.
So, that's what I'm asking all of you attendees to look at as you walk around this community district Point out things that are in or near that rezoning the area that's up for rezoning, so that we can get it to DCP and they can include it in their assessment to the agencies that they're working with, because they're going to work with all the city, agencies.
: City Planning is going to put together a draft zoning proposal and it will probably have four or five different zoning districts and that will be the basis for them to repair the environmental impact statement based on that scope of work and Sorry , Mr. Barrett would be a lot of opportunity for the community and a community board to weigh in on the proposed zoning.
Ongoing thing is related to the various topics of where there could be expense, budget or capital budget opportunities again, because at a larger city budget, situation, you're really more talking about a framework of things you would like to have money spent on there may be sites like the HPD parking lot that may want to be talked about.
The council had a certain sense of what's going to happen to the neighborhood might that affect how they want to accept or modify the rezoning proposal, or are there other resources of the city that the council may try to leverage to try to minimize that kind of effect on your neighborhood We had a zoom with his city planning folks last week, where they presented a very detailed demographic analysis of the study area for M Brown.
Well, first of all, we'll be mih options that, although you can't specify one option having the two options that gives you the best chance of giving people in a community an opportunity to have affordable, housing.
So, that's something we're hoping City, Planning and council would decide, is a worthy goal, because that will allow a lot more people to have success in qualifying for the lottery.
I know the council Lanyu staffers work with councilmember combo to try to identify, affordable housing opportunities in a creative way.
You know, so you can use the uncrowned dialogue in meeting with the agencies that City Planning facilitates you with to go well beyond the uncrowned footprint, finding open space and creative ways.
So I understand that concept, and you know schools and parks and open space, and all of that I just was wanted to clarify what Mr. Eric said.
So, just two and I believe since the last meeting, the Land Use Committee, the North Prospect Heights Association, did send a note in Kathy may be able to correct me, but I think it was to the department, City Planning, asking them to identify potential places where new office space could be created because I think you know knowing the neighborhood as we do and walking.
We do not see very many city- owned Lots that might be available for a creating open space and A you know, keeping in mind just for those who are listening from who are too familiar with the project that because we're because it's a manufacturing, quiet, large of manufacturing, zone, that's being a transform.
So I mean any suggestions you have for how could close the connection for HPD, Department, City, Planning and others just so that there could be an expansion of the playground into the into the into the into the parking lot would be helpful and we did send that letter.
I just want to second, what Peter said me sent a letter to your office, And I, think to Miss Tyus and the board as well about helping us identify opportunities for open space in the project.
We have that survey, data and You 're, not going to see a lot of opportunities, but obviously the HPD lot could be a dialogue about open space again schoolyards, so identifying schools that perhaps.
Do, not know exactly how to say this, but we need to translate those casual observations into something that would be useful for City Planning to put in that space other than bus, parking, lots and junkyards.
Some of the things that DCP has suggested is doing a large meeting where they put up maps They ask people to come over and pin ideas to a particular location.
I'm, sorry, one of the things that we're working on and has been delayed with school, Construction, Authority and The. We is the Education Committee and community for Community, Education, Council, 13 We want to give data to City Planning, as I said.
Just want to add that when City Planning does the environmental impact statement, whether it's those exact numbers, what they're going to do is they're going to take the known buildings that are supposed to happen with or without the rezoning, such as some of the few that went through the EM crown area.
Or is there just no way to do So likely not probably going to use fairly recent, and they have this thing called neighbor, Housing, Survey, community, housing?
Is the City Council land- use office and the councilmembers office I've actually done quite a bit of work, identifying potential community improvements to be associated with this project.
So I do not know the answer this, but before things are deleted, I'd just recommend that we check to make sure that that's actually allowable, because I think you do not want to, on the other hand, delete things that were meant or made public and there's some people.
This is a new technology with actually more ways for people to get input and then just speaking I'm just saying that I think there's a legal question as a public there's, a public meeting, Let people know that if you think you send in something private, it won't be private.
What I'd like to say is that I think you are fortunate that you had a group of people Community board members who realized that there was a problem and we tried to step up and keep it moving so that we did not have the applicant and visitors just hanging.
