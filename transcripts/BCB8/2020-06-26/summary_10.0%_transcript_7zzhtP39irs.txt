Just I'm a consultant on the project, so the owner and the development team is on the line For. My personal information, my name is Tiffany raspberry I'm from Brooklyn New York, originally I've served a few years ago on community board.
I, mostly represent projects that are come before the City Council and before community board should such as yours.
What I'd like to share with everyone is that crown heights north started reaching out to the her bronze school dating back to 2004 intent, Was to work with them to help them meet whatever goals that they were trying to achieve for themselves in terms of the building on Park Place, the school that is, we were not successful in any of our outreach efforts dating back to 2004 coming forward.
It was our intention to send you the first draft to the Community Board on Friday, and so we did not realize that did not happen until today, I submitted names to the host of a handful of people.
As the third hand, raised, followed by Morris, a Jew me Thomas, Lewis and Misha hunter Somebody sent me privately there's just some confusion among people who are not usual community board, meeting, attendees There are quite a few people on this.
So in that email there were several block: Association presidents and individuals who lived area What I say that to say that for the community as a part of Crown Heights North, once we get the plans and we digest what I would offer to the community that has organized around this project since miss raspberry has extended that invitation to us that, like you, come back together and allow her to present to the community or the community members, not the community board price July, that's something that we could possibly consider.
Issues remaining around M crown neighborhood, rezoning We are looking at what we can ask city planning to include in the studies that they're doing to make sure that this neighborhood rezoning hits the mark as far as addressing needs in that six-block area.
These were really groupings and things that seemed to be important to people who had raised it in discussion in the meeting or in writing.- Strategy- The I'm sorry they're, not they're, not with us tonight, but they presented us with a very extensive outline and topics they wanted to cover in outreach sessions to the community really a kind of a whole course in City, Planning.
And I thought you gave a relatively clear description of the different zones of M crown and the e zoning expectations that are the target, There's no almost 60 participants on the call at this point, I think it makes sense just to give the neighbors of the in Crown Heights and specialized than many of those rights that the idea of what to what M crown is with the zoning and the second actually was about the also at the meaning, givers Marshall in this process, and he is a he mentioned.
This effort, so I think it's a reasonable request that he share the input that the Prospect Heights neighborhood development council is providing the Department City Planning We did meet with the Department of City Planning and had a group that was briefed on the project.
So, that's what I'm asking all of you attendees to look at as you walk around this community district Point out things that are in or near that rezoning the area that's up for rezoning, so that we can get it to DCP and they can include it in their assessment to the agencies that they're working with, because they're going to work with all the city, agencies.
: City Planning is going to put together a draft zoning proposal and it will probably have four or five different zoning districts and that will be the basis for them to repair the environmental impact statement based on that scope of work and Sorry.
Might that affect how they want to accept or modify the rezoning proposal, or are there other resources of the city that the council may try to leverage to try to minimize that kind of effect on your neighborhood We had a zoom with his city planning folks last week, where they presented a very detailed demographic analysis of the study area for M Brown.
First of all, we'll be mih options that, although you can't specify one option, having the two options that gives you the best chance of giving people in a community an opportunity to have affordable, housing.
So, that's something we're hoping City, Planning and council would decide, is a worthy goal, because that will allow a lot more people to have success in qualifying for the lottery.
I know the council Lanyu staffers work with councilmember combo to try to identify, affordable housing opportunities in a creative way.
A support of population Elderly, you know, so you can use the uncrowned dialogue in meeting with the agencies that City Planning facilitates you with to go well beyond the uncrowned footprint, finding open space and creative ways.
And I believe since the last meeting, the Land Use Committee, the North Prospect Heights Association, did send a note in Kathy may be able to correct me, but I think it was to the department, City Planning, asking them to identify potential places where new office space could be created because I think you know knowing the neighborhood as we do and walking.
We don't see very many city-owned Lots that might be available for a creating open space and A you know, keeping in mind just for those who are listening from who are too familiar with the project that because we're because it's a manufacturing, quiet, large of manufacturing, zone, that's being a transform.
So I mean any suggestions you have for how could close the connection for HPD, Department, City, Planning and others just so that there could be an expansion of the playground into the into the into the into the parking lot would be helpful and we did send that letter.
I just want to second, what Peter said me sent a letter to your office, And I, think to Miss Tyus and the board as well about helping us identify opportunities for open space in the project.
Let me just remind folks that the Land Use Committee did do a survey of government-owned Lots in the area and possibly we need to do a full-court press on Lots that we identify and see what progress we can make that way.
We have that survey, data and I'll send that out , I'll post it to the land use Google, Group you're, not gonna, see a lot of opportunities, but obviously the HPD lot could be a dialogue about open space again schoolyards, so identifying schools that perhaps.
Three composting and recycling centers in every community board- So I think there's a huge opportunity here to use a lot of that unused space or, as you probably notice, Perhaps the borough president staff or someone could look at the possibility of amending a zoning ordinance to allow some of these new opportunities to be done.
Don't know exactly how to say this, but we need to translate those casual observations into something that would be useful for City Planning to put in that space other than bus, parking, lots and junkyards.
I think it makes sense for the committee to take a look at the available capacity in the existing local schools for this kind of a proposal.
I'm, sorry, one of the things that we're working on and has been delayed with school, Construction, Authority and The. We is the Education Committee and community for Community, Education, Council, 13 We want to give data to City Planning, as I said.
Mr. Volpone I just want to add that when City Planning does the environmental impact statement, whether it's those exact numbers, what they're gonna do is they're gonna take the known buildings that are supposed to happen with or without the rezoning, such as some of the few that went through the EM crown area.
So I, don't know the answer this, but before things are deleted, I'd just recommend that we check to make sure that that's actually allowable, because I think you don't want to, on the other hand, delete things that were meant or made public and there's some people.
This is a new technology with actually more ways for people to get input and then just speaking I'm just saying that I think there's a legal question as a public there's, a public meeting, that's being docume - Well.
What I'd like to say is that I think you are fortunate that you had a group of people community board members who realized that there was a problem and we tried to step up and keep it moving so that we didn't have the applicant and visitors just hanging out.
, like you said a bull in the china shop that you can communicate via text or ask a question just so you could pick up and not you know, we'd not have that happen because we did try to you.
