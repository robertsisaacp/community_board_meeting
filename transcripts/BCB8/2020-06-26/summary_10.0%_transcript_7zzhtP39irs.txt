I mostly represent projects that are come before the City Council and before community board should such as yours , Okay all right before I did have a couple of conversations with Miss Tyus, who was the chair of the landmark and what what I'd love to do is just open up with a couple of statements before I turned it over to you.
Second I am the president of the Crown Heights of North, Association and third, and not necessarily in that order of priority I'm, also on the community board What I'd like to share with everyone is that crown heights north started, reaching out to the her bronze school dating back to 2004 intent was to work with them to help them meet whatever goals that they were trying to achieve for themselves in terms of the building on Park Place, the school that is, we were not successful in any of our outreach efforts dating back to 2004 coming forward They access to reschedule that meeting because it was their Sabbath respectfully We were concerned about that because of what happened the first time so up until December of last year, we made numerous efforts to sit down with the Habra congregation, because we were very concerned about preserving historical culture serving the ha Bron and working with them to get them to utilize some of the resources that we knew were available to them to help them achieve their goals.
I do believe that we should not have a vote this evening because of notifications in the community to the neighbors not being timely, but this is a big project and a big proposal and I think it would help the members in the committee to hear the presentation from the presenters No I cannot because if it's a very big project and I would think that the applicant will be bit more on the ball Okay, let's call the roll and see what happens with the vote on the motion to table to July It would be the second Thursday in July You just won the second way, I told I'm Did. He say he said yes, no see in a second Julia That means we can table it to July applicant to return the second Thursday in July, which they is, which date is July 9th same time same station, do have the Messiah I?
We can do that, but I did try to massage in a run-through of your PowerPoint that we sieved earlier today the day of the meeting, so it may sting, but that's where we are with that process This is something we can consider for the community in particular not the community board So in that email there were several block: Association presidents and individuals who lived area What I say that to say that for the community as a part of Crown Heights North, once we get the plans and we digest what I would offer to the community that has organized around this project since miss raspberry has extended that invitation to us that, like you, come back together and allow her to present to the community or the community members, not the community board price July, that's something that we could possibly consider and I'm addressing that to the community members who took time out to come in here.
It's in your agenda, I, don't think I need to read them out, but I will so we're Looking at public education, transportation and transit, open space density included, apartment sizes and target tenants, land use, income target populations and resiliency This is Atlantic Avenue to Franklin Avenue, to Bergen Street and over two grand back down to Atlantic and then over to the McDonald's lot, which is now included in the study area.
Really a kind of a whole course in City, Planning We, just thought: it'd be easier for them on a consistent day each month that doesn't otherwise conflict with a community board meeting so I, don't know how many of you get a chance to go through the study area to BB zones on a fairly frequent basis.
My second question , the North Prospect Heights Association has this communication is extremely public and when we're sharing it with a committee, so we were just asking mr Makoni We did meet with the Department of City Planning and had a group that was briefed on the project What we've done is draft a letter to the community board which the community board is now in possession of Sorry.
If we pay attention to this opportunity, So that's what I'm asking all of you attendees to look at as you walk around this community district point out things that are in or near that rezoning the area that's up for rezoning, so that we can get it to DCP and they can include it in their assessment to the agencies that they're working with, because they're going to work with all the city agencies It's, not something that can be published, though, since there are private messages.
The people weren't feeling put out I Mr Barack, is still with us, I'd like to ask him to make some comments and suggestions for the audience regarding input from the community into this opportunity for rezoning, : City Planning is going to put together a draft zoning proposal and it will probably have four or five different zoning districts and that will be the basis for them to repair the environmental impact statement based on that scope of work and Sorry.
Do you indicate substantial displacement, particularly by income and race over the last 10 years in the study area, and it's something I hope that they'll be able to present the future land-use I hear people like dr lazaar asking is: How do we manage the negative effects?
, The lottery does allow you that opportunity to win the unit, even though it would reduce your rent so wanted a policies to borrow presidents been trying to push for there's a change so that, even though you'll win a unit and you'll still be rent bird and you're still gonna pay less rent So, that's something we're hoping City, Planning and council would decide, is a worthy goal, because that will allow a lot more people to have success in qualifying for the lottery In terms of.
Elderly you know, so you can use the uncrowned dialogue in meeting with the agencies that City Planning facilitates you with to go well beyond the uncrowned footprint, finding open space and creative ways, Sometimes it's turning school yards into after-hours playground.
It does certainly a lot of examples crossings at the street there, the sidewalks should kind of pop out more into the street Looking literally anything that comes to mind, that would help improve the neighborhood I think should be brought to the attention from people who live in a neighborhood and I believe since the last meeting, the Land Use Committee, the North Prospect Heights Association, did send a note in Kathy may be able to correct me, but I think it was to the department, City Planning, asking them to identify potential places where new office space could be created because I think you know knowing the neighborhood as we do and walking around We don't see very many city-owned Lots that might be available for a creating open space and a you know, keeping in mind just for those who are listening from who are too familiar with the project that because we're because it's a manufacturing, quiet, large of manufacturing zone, that's being a transform.
I just want to second, what Peter said me sent a letter to your office and I think to Miss Tyus and the board as well about helping us identify opportunities for open space in the project Let me just remind folks that the Land Use Committee did do a survey of government-owned Lots in the area and possibly we need to do a full-court press on Lots that we identify and see what progress we can make that way.
We have that survey data I'll post it to the land use Google, Group you're, not gonna, see a lot of opportunities, but obviously the HPD lot could be a dialogue about open space again schoolyards, so identifying schools that perhaps, if they're opened up more hours or if parks had different equipment, could they provide for more people or more children?
Don't know exactly how to say this, but we need to translate those casual observations into something that would be useful for City Planning to put in that space other than bus parking, lots and junkyards, and they ask people to come over and pin ideas to a particular location on the map.
Sorry, one of the things that we're working on and has been delayed with school Construction Authority and the we is the Education Committee and community for Community Education Council 13 We want to give data to City Planning, as I said, can we meaning this Community Education Council number 13, which is has oversight over that area, as well as the community board are in the midst of teasing out that data?
The prognostication is that we could get approximately 400 Reid 400 500 dwelling units from different sites in the in the area to be zoned as private property owners come in and build am I, correct, That's , the affordable number Let me come back a few just a second Welling units, so I, don't know how you pull a number of how you plan for a number of school seats with that kind of nebulous datum is what , the I think the exact ratio is public.
Mr Volpone I just want to add that when City Planning does the environmental impact statement, whether it's those exact numbers, what they're gonna do is they're gonna take the known buildings that are supposed to happen with or without the rezoning, such as some of the few that went through the EM crown area already they'll make that part of the baseline condition project school needs, combined also with a general growth factor that they're going to assume and then they'll project based on a new units, they'll plug in a number- and you add the couple hundred units from the other approvals you could plug in that number like now and know how many projected elementary middle school and high school students that the study would likely disclose, say eight months from now and again and I'm wondering because you know the state is broken down, for example, deaths from kovat by County, but I, don't know if there's data being collected on how many people have died by a community district and also there have been a lot of people who have just left the city so likely not probably gonna use fairly recent and they have this thing called neighbor Housing, Survey, community, housing?
