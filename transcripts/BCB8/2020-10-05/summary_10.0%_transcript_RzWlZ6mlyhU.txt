Looking for the Community Board 8 renewal, application.
Thank you, miss Neil, all right, so I guess we'll go ahead and move on to the one new application here for 643 vanderbilt.
These are the ones you said, are the rough documents for now, and also I sent you a second email, verifying that my representation was in context with someone I guess today, So. Let me go ahead and read off your application for the benefit of our members, as well as the community members that have joined us, today.
If whatever gets presented on this application and then forwarded to the SLA for approvals, would be limited, and so your limitations, regardless of restrictions, are lifted, would be to eight people indoors and that's what I just want to make sure that you're comfortable that that's the way this is moving along.
Hours of operations are Sunday from noon to 8 pm Monday closed for service, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, noon, to 10, P.M, Friday and Saturday noon to 11 This be your hours just proposed for this current business.
Oh hi, Miss Weatherspoon, just one second, any questions from community members all right hearing or seeing none I'll open it up to miss weather to the committee and start with Miss Weatherspoon.
Right now and to hear of someone who's, open, Can you just maybe talk a little bit about what strategy is there and how you've been able to open up multiple or how you're planning to be successful with multiple food service, establishments?
If we opened in, I guess, in the heart of the pandemic, if you so to speak, right, hey You, know in terms of the service that we offer.
We look forward to servicing you guys, thank you, Mr Viconi, any other questions or comments from our committee.
Hearing or seeing no other questions, I respectfully ask for emotion from our members motion to application is presented.
However, we're kind of in a in a kind of a jam, because we do not have any materials to work off of or what you're presenting for renewal Let us move on and deal with another application we might give us it might give us like five minutes for you to put something together, and maybe we can go through this and in Tandem and work live unless somebody has any issues.
So, that being said, I, would like to read this application for review for the benefit of our committee and our community.
Ms Cheryl Smith is the principal presenting a renewal application for Go sky Com and Inc doing business as Cheryl's global soul, restaurant at 236, underhill, avenue.
There are three speakers in the dining room at 60, watts, no live entertainment, being presented, 14 service employees in normal times, currently, six, no residences in the building, no residences to the left, right, rear, and currently operational changes have been reductions on staff hours due to coding, protocols.
So this is their application from 2018 14 tables, with 32 seats, no bar space at all, closing at 10 pm Sunday through Thursday 11, pm, Friday and Saturday.
So I do not know that we can recommend something other than what was presented, but I think we should say something leaving open the possibility of approving the previous hours if they want to provide an updated application for the general meeting.
He has not officially made it yet, but I'm happy to know that you're in support any other committee members with questions or comments.
Who wants a second and understands that I'll talk about it all right, a little bit unique and timely for the specific circumstances, but does any of our committee members have questions on the motion?
Are we able to review the application as a as a renewal and they And they submit the paperwork tomorrow for before the next community board?
It was on the verge of a 30-day waiver that their renewal has probably already been made at the state level, but in efforts for us to do our due diligence and to review applications as a body, and we will certainly hear this information currently and may able to make any decisions based on this through an oral presentation and submitting our recommendations to the state based on the full board supporting any of our action items.
So at this point, I'd like for any questions or comments from any of our community members that may be present I'm going to now open it up to any committee members that might have questions or comments to this application.
Would you like to offer anything I believe the summons was issued was for a second bar in the basement at the location it was issued by SLA.
Okay, I I'm struggling with this, because I certainly understand that things happened and I'm, not making any judgment about what occurred at your establishment, and I want to be some supportive This is really to the committee to try to support him with what some kind of stipulations, but I'm, not so sure what they should.
So my remaining question is: Should the committee support this licensed renewable?
We do not get the liquor license, renewal, we'll be paying the 20,000 fine for no reason at all, because we can't operate coming down from you know.
You, know this committee and this body of community members are encouraging our restaurants and bar establishments to be successful, but only under the guise of operating under the recurrent regulations that are allowable.
I would just like to add that I distinctly remember when they came before the board originally and asked Answer liquor license and they were given a difficult time and they had to come.
I will also remind you, as an applicant and any other applicants that are still here, that these recommendations will be will be presented at the full board meeting and we'll also need the support of the community.
It will only be a recommendation from this committee and we want you present to be able to answer any questions if any of the community members or any of our board members have directed for you.
Only gotten one 30-day notice of intent to apply for a liquor license right now, And, it's actually for a new application.
I want to ask for many committee members or community members.
As, a community member that you know, I've, been participating in open streets as a as a guest.
We do not want to involve police in anything that happens on Vanderbilt Avenue, we're dependent on people showing their good will towards the businesses of our community and not trying to take it away for themselves for some other purpose.
I want to express my thanks to all the applicants that are continuing to invest during this kind of on this questionable period in business in community board eight.
