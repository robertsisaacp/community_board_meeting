I believe my representation emailed you over all the necessary documentation would have come from Andrew yeah we've got a packet. I believe that was about 33 pages, but there I do not remember seeing any floor plans or any sample menus if they did not send it. I can send you over a copy, real quick. If anything is there, is there a way you could potentially share it in the chat? Unfortunately, I do not have them using my ipad, so I do not have the ability to do it from here. Okay, Mr Ellis, the representative from resonator, stated that the build- out is currently underway and that that's why floor plans are not available. Final four plans are not available correct. Thank you great, but Mr Mcdonald's. If you have any giraffes or anything yeah, I have a dress. It's not finalized.

Mr Mcdonald pleasure. Anyone. Let me just mute my phone here, great yeah, for those of you. If you can just go ahead and mute yourselves unless you're speaking just to help prevent any feedback and any difficulties in audio, I'm still looking to identify who the 917 number is ending in four okay, just guys, let you know I just want to give you a heads up. We have a special guest on a call as well. We have the CEO with the men with the vision behind this franchise. His name is Mr Rodney bond, so he's joining us as well. So thank you Mr bond. We will check in with you when it's your time to hear your application. Thank you for having me appreciate it, and now I see another phone number that starts with seven one eight and ends with nine six. That's Joelle clacken from sweet, 704 restaurant, I'm trying to connect online, but for some reason I'm not able to connect. So I had to call in all right well sorry about the difficulties, but I will say that we do not have any of your paperwork. Thank you, Mr Ellis! I was going to ask them if they can quickly email it to us. Okay, I'll, definitely send that over to your representative, told us that it was already sent in, but I can forward that over as well. You should request your fees back because they did not send it well, I do not apologize I'll have that sent over shortly. I see Mr Witherwax has joined us. Is our co- chair of the committee just want to acknowledge his arrival as well as CB8 staff? Virgilia Neil is with us as a part of our committee proceedings. There are other committee members with us and it looks like there might be a few applicants. I imagine there might be a community member or two, but we will just to identify and say Lieutenant Eric Dalman is here: Mr Telma. Can you identify yourself Lieutenant Dalman? Are you there? Okay, coming hello hi there hello? This is police officer vidal from the samsung precinct, oh great, for the SLA great thank you officer. Thanks for joining us, we'll feel free to as we review the applications that are in the 77th precinct. That might have any issues that need to be brought to our attention, either in past operations or in current locations, and we will go through those applications one at a time and ask if you have anything to say about those when the time comes all right, I'll see what I can do. Thank you good evening. All right, hi, Miss collins, thanks for joining thank you- is the Ellis aside from muting and unmuting participants. Would you like me to assist with any of the things on tonight's meeting as long as I guess we're getting a top appropriate documentation? I went through the email on Friday. I only had the two applicants from cheryl applications from Cheryl's and Bk Lobster, and today I sent emails to anyone else that I could not find. I'm actually surprised by 704 is on this call tonight, since they did need a 30-day waiver, as their license actually expired at the end of September, but they were invited. I did ask them to please send the info sheet. I do not have it, but I mean hey to each their own. So can you? Can you just remind us, while we're still waiting to reach Quorum, what that 30-day waiver means and what kind of impacts it might have to today's? Do we need to hold it over until next month that, basically, the 30-day waiver is if they, if their license, is going to expire 30 days prior to the hearing and the board being able to send a letter of recommendation and also for them to apply for their renewal license? Usually the state liquor Authority sends out renewal paperwork 60 to 90 days in advance. I understand that the pandemic is causing a delay in some of that. Some applicants have not been able to get the 30-day notices to us within 30 days prior to the expiration of the license. Usually, the cba will provide a one- time waiver for the 30-day notification period to an applicant one time for the lifetime of the business bar 704 was given that waiver and that's it their license. They should have been able to get their renewal license either today being Monday or last week, Friday or something since you know it expired, September, 30th, okay, so we're okay to proceed as normal once we receive their. If and when we receive their paperwork, that's correct! Yes, anything! I'm sorry to interrupt. This is Janelle Daniel Representative of creative Square studios Bk. I did not want to interrupt while you guys were speaking. We currently apply for renewal as well all right, Miss Daniel. We do not have any of your paperwork either. So have any paperwork. We can't hear your application today. Okay, the attorney as I I've only gotten three applications via email. I do not have anything for you guys. I know you're on Pacific street. If you can email us the info form, I can send it to the committee really quickly. May I have the email please, the attorney John Springer mentioned that he did send all appropriate paperwork. So I have your 30-day notice, that's it! I do not have your info sheet. Okay, gmail.com I'll, put it in the chat. Okay, thank you. We are also dressed up. I'm sorry! No! I was just saying this is Joelle and I was just telling you that I did send over the application via email about five minutes ago. Okay, all right! Thank you all right. Look I from a rough count. It looks like I have. We have enough committee members to meet Quorum well out of respect. Ask those that are available to please start your video as a committee member out of respect to the applicants and to the audience to make ourselves visible. Additionally, I would ask, as a part of housekeeping to please keep your microphones muted unless there is a case for you to be called upon to speak or share any concerns. That would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Mr Witherwax. Would you like to call the official role, be my pleasure, Wayne Bailey said he'd be about a half hour late, Muhammad, sorry, Mr witherwax. I think we have an updated roster that starts now. I have it. It's just not alphabetized. Give me give me one moment: okay, no problem, sorry to Interrupt here, Mr Allison, I apologize bear with me.

I do not think your audio is working Mr Allison, just as a heads up, it does not show muted, but I do not hear anything so all right, I'm in any case. Thank you for joining everybody. I want to just do a quick check to see which of our agenda items are present. So if you are a applicant that is assuming they have business before us today, please acknowledge your presence. When I call your address. 154 miss Daniel, 154 utica. She might have left we'll see: 236 underhill, 1662, Atlantic, Avenue, okay, seven or four no string present 628 nostrum, 444 ralph 634 vanderbilt did you mean 643 vanderbilt? Yes, I did I'm sorry. We had a transpo transposition error in that address. Thank you for that clarity. Is there any other members in this call today that have are expecting to be presenting an application that did not make our agenda all right, then hearing or seeing no other additions or corrections to our agenda? I'd like to officially get started. I guess I do not know Mr Widowack, so we have some people that are here that we do not have paperwork for we have some paperwork there. People are not here. Do you want to make a suggestion on how we proceed well, who's here and has paperwork? We have partial paperwork for the new applicant at 643 vanderbilt. Let's do that. They at least did both very well. Then thank you for your suggestion. I'm checking. Can we just for the sake of expediency, since some of the renewals are actually open? Can we just dispatch? The renewals first essence is here: their paperwork was submitted. Essence, it's on the call. Yes, I asked for them to acknowledge themselves. I did not hear anybody respond. I'm sorry! Yes, I'm here! Oh Mr, Baez! Okay! Yes, thank you. I did not. I did not hear you respond. So why Bob sorry? Well, the first time I'm doing this well welcome. I think it's many of our first times and trying to navigate conduct community board business via teleconference. So thank you for your patience. We think we have a methodology to get us through this. Nonetheless, let's go ahead and get started for the renewal Mr Bye in the application. It says that the principal is Kenneth Morrison. What's your relationship manager you're the manager? Yes great, all right, let me go ahead and read your renewal application into for the for the information of the rest of our participants and community members that may not be able to follow along with any Mrs Collins and Mr bays. Please mute themselves, so we can have a channel for communication. Sorry, I'm just going to add the address to this. Yes, Ma'am Miss collins. This is 1662 66, Atlantic Avenue. It's that believe that Atlantic and troy. If I'm not mistaken, Mr price, you want to nod your heading confirmation. Thank you all right. So this application is essence bar address. At 1662, Atlantic Avenue been operational for 18 years as a restaurant and bar with a full license serving liquor. Wine, beer and cider there are 12 tables and two seats at each table. One bar with 20 seats for a total capacity of 60. hours of operation have been Sunday. 2 pm to 2 am Monday Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday noon to 2 A.M Friday noon to 3 A.M Saturday 2 P.M to 3 A.M outdoor service area includes a rear yard that is 23 by 23 feet. We do not have any information on this application about their seating capacity, nor do we have a diagram. Why do not? I take a pause there and ask them ask Mr bays to tell us about the seating capacity in the rear yard. It's about four tables outside and four chairs per table. Is that under current circumstances, or has that also been historically the size just the same size? So no changes were made due to outdoor time restrictions. No changes, though, all right. Thank you for that clarity. Moving along application. There has no other outdoor space. Sound system includes two speakers indoors. Occasional live music is offered three service employees with security cameras, three residences in the building, where the establishment is located. Two residences to the left right and rear no operational changes. Since the last review of this application, no operational changes planned to be implemented before the next renewable period. Mr Bias. Can you maybe just share before I open up to any questions or comments from the community, any steps that your establishment has taken to deal with the indoor and outdoor dining restrictions right now we just have outdoor no indoor, I'm not doing indoors, so I figured I'd wait until they at least do capacity of 50., so we've been just doing take out an outdoor great. Are you guys indulging in any delivery services? Yes, take out Uber dash, grubhub, okay, great, thank you for that update, and can you also tell us your outdoor dining hours, it's from 12 until 11. 12 P.M to 11:00 p.m? Great! All right! Are there any questions or comments about the renewal of this application from our community members if there are any community members on this teleconference survivor meeting? Thank you. Yes, any questions or comments from our committee members about the renewal application being presented, of course, Hi Mr Thurton. Please go ahead with your establishment. How have you guys how you've been making out with the Covid-19, because I've passed by there and I see no activities? I guess you do all your all your services in the rare yard and how is that working out? Well, I hate to say it, but thank God for grubhub and take out because that pretty much saved me because that's all I was doing from the very beginning, but I guess because I've been doing it for a while I've built a clientele with that, so that pretty much is holding me off. The landlord is very reasonable. So that's been the biggest thing. The outdoor people really do not know. We have an outdoor, but I have a large following of the police department. So I get a lot of regular customers that come out from that. So that's great. They they're great supporters all right. Well, that's I'm glad to hear that you've been able to sustain yourself as a small straw poll and by no means do you need to offer any information that might be trivia, but were you able to work out any negotiations and Lord for any rent arrested during this period? Yes, I still have to pay rent, but we knocked it down some all right. Thank you. We're just trying, like I said, just a straw poll to get an idea of how some of our businesses are responding and working with their landlords all right. Any other questions from the committee members on the renewal of this application of essence bar at 1662, Atlantic, Mr Vice, do not mind muting yourself, thank you hearing or seeing no other questions or comments. I ask for emotion from our committee members yeah. I recommend that we vote on this application as presented. This is yourself a nice second weather spoon. Miss ears. Do you find just clarifying your most slightly instead of voting for this application? Do you want to put a position you speaking to me? Yes, ma'am? Well, yeah. I propose that we accept. Thank you. That's what I was looking for as either a supporter no support. No, I just heard I just heard you mentioned to vote on this application and I wanted to know which one Mr Witherwax. Is that fine? Would you all right? It looks like he's confirmed that just slightly clarity, so we have a motion from his weatherspoon to support the application, as presented second by Mr Witherwax. If there are any questions on this motion by committee members, please let us know now all right hearing or singing, and I asked Mr Wax to call the role please the vote, all right start on muting everybody Mr Allison. Can you give us a thumbs up an indicator because we can't hear you great got it thumbs up or thumbs down? No pressure. Hey. Are you here yet branch mohammed? You miss yes, yeah! Thank you!

Yes, thank you! Miss Weatherspoon! Yes, thank you! Mr Witherwax, yes, Miss young! Yes, thank you. The motion passes unanimously 12 in favor great. Thank you, Mr Witherwax, Mr Bayes. Thank you very much for coming today and presenting your renewal application. We wish you continued success during this new business landscape and hopefully won't have to see you for another two years, all right. Moving on to our next renewal. I guess, as we get more information, I did not see the oh here. It is revised, so there we go some plans. I want to double check on. Did Miss daniels make it back yet for creative studios is Cheryl's under her calf cheryl's on underhill join us, and then I guess we're still waiting for paperwork from bar 704. I'm sorry, Mr Ellis is there another place. I could send the paperwork, so I did email it over and it said that it went through. All right. R704 was forwarded to the committee. Ah, yes, that's the one I'm looking at. Oh, no, that's the that was Bk lobster. That was the second one that I just had about five minutes ago, bar 704 was sent some about 25:30 minutes ago. I do not know about 20 minutes ago. Sorry, all right. Unfortunately, I do not have it, and I see why it's not the information sheet it is. It is what they submit to the state liquor Authority, please disregard it's, not what we need, so we're sit for bar 704, I'm looking for the Community Board 8 renewal, application. Okay, just give me one second, and I will I will put the link to the file in the in the chat and any applicant that does not have the renewal form can download the file from our website. You can complete it and send it back to us. Thank you, miss Neil, all right, so I guess we'll go ahead and move on to the one new application here for 643 vanderbilt. Once again, we're asking just remind me who those applicants are that are here today, just re- identify yourself, please John, Mcdonald, Bennett, Holdings, Acquisitions, Llc, sure and you were joined by also the CEO. I think Mr Rodney bonds right great. Thank you, Mr bonds, Mr Mcdonald. Let me pull up your application that I just received. Just please verify that you know that I sent it as well. I received a 13-page document hold on. It looks like I've got some architectural plans. Yep there we go. These are the ones you said, are the rough documents for now, and also I sent you a second email, verifying that my representation was in context with someone I guess today and they confirmed that they had the complete package. So if you look at the email thread, you should see everything pretty much in there right all right. So let me go ahead and read off your application for the benefit of our members, as well as the community members that have joined us today. Let me get back to the screen, so I can see myself do this all right, so Mr Mcdonald here is representing Bennett Holdings and acquisitions Llc proposal of an application doing business as Bk lobster at 643, vanderbilt Avenue. This would be a restaurant bar seeking a wine beer and cider license inclusive of four tables with eight seats. So is that four two tops of eight two per table correct and, as that would be your floor plan for the current landscape or as it might be proposed if restrictions and higher capacities were allowed correct. The current plans, as if restrictions were allowed, we're predominantly going to focus more on takeout. Also, you know, do dining as well, but but we're anticipating that this may, you know, carry on a little bit longer than expected, so we're preparing for that. You know as well, so I just I the reason why I'm asking Mr Mcdonald is that, if whatever gets presented on this application and then forwarded to the SLA for approvals, would be limited, and so your limitations, regardless of restrictions are lifted, would be to eight people indoors and that's what I just want to make sure that you're comfortable that that's the way this is moving along all right. Thank you. There is also inclusive of one bar area service area. With zero seats, maximum patron capacity would be 28., proposed. Hours of operations are Sunday from noon to 8 pm Monday closed for service, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday noon, to 10, P.M, Friday and Saturday noon to 11 P.M. Once again, I'm going to ask you miss Mr Mcdonald. Would this be your hours just proposed for this current business landscape? Or if things were to change, would you be interested or seeking to extend your hours of operation? No, this is going to be confirmed. These are the business hours that we're going to conduct. Thank you very much. No outdoor space indicated on the application. One Ipod driven music program with two speakers- no live entertainment to be offered three or four service employees. There has been expressed interest to participate in the Community board, 8 local hiring program of which we can forward more information from the board office, but we are in partnership with a local hiring program out of the bed- stuy Restoration corporation zero security anticipated other security measures includes 24:7 surveillance cameras within the Interior and exterior of the establishment. Two residences in this building, where the location is located to the right are six left is two and the rear is six. All right, I think, then we saw some drafts in their package that included some signatures of support from local businesses nearby. I am, I think, in looking through those, many of them are in the on the vanderbilt commercial corridor. There were a few other names I imagine are. They were other businesses that were not familiar with those names, but were there any residential support letters that your team received? I believe we had a couple in here all right and then at one point of clarity. Mr Mcdonald was the was any of those signatures from the real estate office of Mr, saunders and others. Were they, your representative broker or your or your landlord or management? No, my representing landlord is Mr Ron Mclaren, okay same company yeah, so I just want to clarify sometimes with letters of support from your real estate agent or management companies. They have a vested interest, so we just have to take that into consideration as a support, yeah well, yeah sure. Thank you all right. I wanna just all right. I do not I'd open up this to any questions or comments from our community members. If there is a question or comment for this application for Bk lobster at 643, vanderbilt, Mr, Mcdonald, real, quick, what's the cross streets on Vanderbilt, where you're looking prospect and Saint Mark's prospect and Saint Mark's, okay right James, I have a question: I'm sorry who's that asking I'm sorry yourself: oh hi, Miss Weatherspoon, just one second, any questions from community members all right hearing or seeing none I'll open it up to miss weather to the committee and start with Miss Weatherspoon. Yes, do you have another location on Noston Avenue? Yes, we do the same. That's our flagship store! Okay, do you have any other locations? Yes, we do. We have another location on myrtle, Avenue, Clinton, hills area as well. How long? How long have you guys been in operation on Myrtle Avenue, we're fairly new? I believe, murder album. We opened that establishment back in May of 2020 may so roughly six or seven months ago, give or take how's that working out for you going great being welcome with open arms, pretty much in all the locations we've been and we I have not had the opportunity to tell you how excited we are to be in prospect heights, we're all broken knights. We love Brooklyn. So that's the motivating drive behind this is that we're all from Brooklyn, myself included. Obviously we love you know just being out in our entire neighborhood, basically just bringing a service that we enjoy doing, and we expect the people to love and put a smile on everyone's face. So that's what we you know hoping to do and that's what we've done thus far. We've looked to continue doing that as well great question about your other locations, if I may just to piggyback on miss weatherspoons, those other locations are also doing wine, beer and cider service. No only the notion of services doing alcohol, so this would be your second location with alcohol service correct and you have a total of three right just to clear that five correct. So this would be your third sorry correct great. Thank you any other questions from our committee members and then Mr Viconi, I'm just a little confused, because the name is misleading. What kind of cuisine do you sell? We specialize in casual seafood, so what we're known for is our lobster rolls, but we also offer an entree of different seafood dishes as well, as you know, salmon as well as crab legs, so we offer a variety of different dishes as well. Excuse me and to be clear, the lobster is not caught in Brooklyn, so we're going to show you that we look forward to definitely seeing all you guys the input and small one as well as others as well so seafood lovers I mean most people are, but hopefully you guys are all right. Mr, Viconi, Mr Witherwax asked one of my questions. My other question is maybe a little bit more recommended, which is you know it's really. It's really interesting and kind of admirable to see folks opening restaurant not an easy time for the restaurant business at all. Right now and to hear of someone who's open, two restaurants during the lockdown is really pretty impressive. I mean: what's? Can you just maybe talk a little bit about what strategy is there and how you've been able to open up multiple or how you're planning to be successful with multiple food service establishments? Opening when established ones are actually having a lot of difficulty right now? It's the support. It really comes from the support I mean, I think, we're all driven individuals. We, you know very competitive, we love what we do and it just kind of shows it reflects in the service that we provide. So I think, that's kind of where it stems from. I think, offering something. That's a bit unique and a little different that most people are not. You know have not seen it with the exception of going to such as a larger chain such as a red lobster. We offer more of a casual fast. You know you do not have to sit down and do a full time, full service, dining we're offering the same services but at a faster scale. So no, I understand that. I guess what I was getting is well, let's take your myrtle Avenue. How has that been? How is that going? You know from an operating point of view, given the pandemic, I guess what you're saying is you're expecting a lot of your plan anticipates a lot of takeout business and taking out business is not affected by the pandemic in the same way, if we opened in, I guess, in the heart of the pandemic, if you so to speak, right, hey and we've done exceptionally well, and this applies also to all the locations as well. You know obvious by the grace of probably, of course, we hold out all our blessings that you know. We've been very successful in terms of the target. You know in terms of the service that we offer. We do not primarily focus on a sit down, so we offer casual food to go. So it's not okay, right, intense. I wish you luck and I look forward to trying your food. I look forward to we look forward to servicing you guys, thank you, Mr Viconi, any other questions or comments from our committee members. Yes, I have a question hi. Can you hear me? Sorry? Yes, can you just identify yourself, miss Colin, hello, hi, Mrs hi. I think I missed it at the big towards the beginning. Did did you notify Miss Mcdonald the residents in the area? I thought I just heard that the realtors were notified or they got. You got letters of approval yeah. There was some support. Letters in add some clarity. There was a in the package. There was a series of support letters, many of which were local businesses. Mr Mcdonald had mentioned that some of the other names on that list were also local neighborhood residents and if you notice also in that package, there are photographs of the postings, the public postings of this meeting, that this restaurant was seeking a particular license for this service. Okay, I just did not hear that said. Thank you. Yes, you're welcome, no problem, any other questions from our committee members. Hearing or seeing no other questions, I respectfully ask for emotion from our members motion to application is presented. A second can the circuit person in just a second, oh, is that Miss young? Yes, it is all right. We have a motion by Mr Verconi to support the application, as presented seconded by Ms Debra young. Any questions on this motion hearing or seeing none I'll ask Mr Wax to call the vote. Please all right, unmute everybody thumbs up. If you can Mr Bailey. Are you here miss French, Muhammad Sir again? Was that a yes? Thank you miss collins, yes, Duke Mr Ellis! Yes, thank you! Mr Myers, Mr Puka. Yes, thanks Mr Saunders, yes, Mr Staton, Mr Thurton! Yes, thank you! Miss Weatherspoon! Yes, thank you! Mr Witherwax! Yes, Miss young! Yes, thank you. The motion passes 12 in favor Mr weatherwax. Did you get a vote from Mr Allison? I thought I saw a thumbs up all right. I missed that. I was getting my paperwork together. Thank you all right, excellent! Thank you! Mr Witherwax, it looks like I just want to do another double check to see if any other applicants have joined us. Let me see: is there anyone here from 628 nostrand Avenue 444, Ralph, Avenue, 154, Utica, 236, underhill, 704, no stream, 704 Nostradamus? Still here all right were you able to send over any paperwork just I mean this is definitely my first time doing this. Just to clarify the paperwork that you are looking for is the one that says standard notice form for providing 30-day advance notice to community. No sir, no, we need we need the information sheet, which is the link that I put into the chat about 15 minutes ago. It's on the community board 8 website. It's the renewal application for Renewal, I think, is maybe what it's titled, okay I'll, definitely get on. That is it possible for me to reschedule for tomorrow, but we do not convene, but once again we unfortunately we only convene this month and we will not. We will not be convening again until November, okay, I'll try to get this in. I just have to locate it I'll. Try to get this in before we're finished today. Okay, we have I mean this is we're getting toward the end, so we that's why we're doing a last call. So, unfortunately, there's not a lot of time here I defer to any of the members of the committee. If there's any alternatives that they potentially would propose in this situation, everyone, I was told by Mrs Springer that everything was submitted, but I guess, unfortunately that was not the was not the case. It is this. A standard renewal that we're looking at Mr Weatherworks is shaking his head. Would you like to clarify? Is not this the 30-day renewal there they miss their target, so we need to correct me if I'm wrong James right, I think you they did miss their 30-day notification, which evidently we I think it was offered to grant them the one- time waiver for the lifetime of the establishment, but we still need materials to be able to work off of to make our decision Mr Ellis, our our notice was sent but sent in before the 30 days. We do have email confirmation from the post office that they try to deliver the packages to the cba, and this is the reason why we were granted the the waiver, but this was done. I have the date here that it was sent in according to the Post office. Okay. Well, that was done on August 27th, okay. Well, that would certainly help Kyle clarify that circumstance with the notification to the community board. However, we're kind of in a in a kind of a jam because we do not have any materials to work off of or what you're presenting for renewal yeah that. So why do not you let take a moment? Let us move on and deal with another application we might give us it might give us like five minutes for you to put something together, and maybe we can go through this and in Tandem and work live unless somebody has any issues. So that's a good question. Miss Tyus! Our chairwoman is here also as a member of the committee and suggested that maybe if he can complete the application or has a copy of the application and he could present from his screen, maybe the Cb office allows him to present from the screen. We would be able to vet that, but that would require him having that paperwork ready to go and present. So I will defer in a second but let's go ahead and entertain cheryl's, since we do have their paperwork and they are a long time business in prospect heights, we can at least move through their renewal application, despite the fact that there's no representative present. So that being said, I would like to read this application for review for the benefit of our committee and our community. Ms Cheryl Smith is the principal presenting a renewal application for Go sky Com and Inc doing business as Cheryl's global soul, restaurant at 236, underhill avenue. Their current hours of operations are 12 to 8 pm as a restaurant bar. Unfortunately, it does not indicate their license type. Does anyone recall if they're full license or a beer and wine license hold on? They are full they're full, I'm pretty sure cheryl's is a full liquor license right. Thank you, yep, and that full benefit of those who are the full license includes liquor, beer, wine and cider. There are 14 tables with 32 seats, but currently there are six tables with 12 seats, one bar with four seats. Maximum interior capacity is 32, but currently is 14 due to restrictions their hours of operation on the application are noon. Oh wait! Let me rephrase that Sunday appears to be 10 to 8 P.M Sorry 10 A.M to 8 P.M, Monday, Tuesday Wednesday is noon to 8 pm Thursday Friday Saturday 10 A.M to 8 P.M, maybe Mr witherbacks. If you have that at your disposal, would you be able to share what their previous operation hours might have been? I do not, but I suspect, Cheryl has put in her pandemic hours with this because they generally stay open later. I just want to make sure that we're not voting on something that might pigeonhole them into being only until 8 pm if they were to choose differently. You know I do not have a prior record of a prior renewal, but I'm sure they were open. Give me give me two minutes and I'll see if I can't find their 2018 renewal. Thank you miss Neil, as we look into that just so, we can make a careful and appropriate recommendation as needed. We will carry on. They also have an outdoor garden space. That is looks to be 18 feet by 30 feet. Currently with nine tables and 30 seats. I think it previously nine tables with 30 seats, but currently operating with five tables and 15 seats. That hours of operation are the same as the business hours 10 am to 8 pm, Thursday Friday, Saturday, Sunday noon to 8 pm Monday Tuesday Wednesday. There are three speakers in the dining room at 60 watts, no live entertainment being presented, 14 service employees in normal times, currently, six, no residences in the building, no residences to the left, right, rear and currently operational changes have been reductions on staff hours due to coding protocols. Any operation changes planned in the upcoming year is rebuilding the business back all right as we wait for our esteemed staff, member at the board office to pull up some archive records. I want to ask it's been sent to the committee, but I have their 2018 open. If you wanted me to read it, would you mind sharing their historical hours of operations for us sure? Okay, so this is their application from 2018 14 tables, with 32 seats, no bar space at all, closing at 10 pm Sunday through Thursday 11 pm, Friday and Saturday. They do have a garden space 18 by 20 feet with nine tables and 24 seats match maximum Patron capacity. 28 the outdoor space stays open same hours as indoor space, and that is about that. Is it so two hours additional? Are there non pandemic hours till 10 and 11.? Thank you for that clarity. I appreciate it miss Neil any questions from the community members about this renewal application, any questions or comments from our committee members on this renewal application, Mr Bocconi. My advice would be for us to vote on this as presented with a further clarification that we recommend the full board approve the prior hours of operation. If the applicant updates their application prior to the full board meeting, would you like to take another crack at that in the form of emotion? But I think we I do not know that we can approve. So I do not know that we can recommend something other than what was presented, but I think we should say something leaving open the possibility of approving the previous hours if they want to provide an updated application for the general meeting. Thank you, Mr Tony. I will wait and we will I'll ask you to make said motion as you offered just to. Let me check with anybody else if any questions or comments any other committee members with questions for prospect. Second out of motion, emotion hold on Mr saunders. He has not officially made it yet, but I'm happy to know that you're in support any other committee members with questions or comments all right, Mr Ficoni. Would you like to make another stab at what you're suggesting sure I'd like to move that the committee support the application for renewal as presented and that it recommend the board office advise the applicant to present an updated application matching the prior hours, which the committee further recommends, the full board approve it presented. I understand that. Is there someone who's? Second, who wants a second and understands that I'll talk about it all right, a little bit unique and timely for the specific circumstances, but does any of our committee members have questions on the motion? Mr Viconia has made no indications of any questions or comments. I'll ask Mr Wax to call the vote. Please Mr Ellison! Thank you. Mr Bailey, the scale branch. Muhammad! Yes, thank you miss collins! No thank you! Miss Duke Ellis! Yes, thank you! Mr Puka! Yes, thank you. Mr saunders, you Mr Thurton Mr Curtin, Mr Thurton. Thank you! Miss Tyus! Yes, thank you. Mr Piccone, yes, focus! Yes! Thank you. Mr Witherbox, yes, Miss young. Yes, this is the left in favor one opposed. Thank you. I received a message in the chat that the email was sent to the this applicant, requesting an updated form with pre- covered information, if necessary. So thank you for that. Miss Neil. Thank you all for these applications with us, I'm just going to refer back to our friends at 704 nostrand to see if they were able to complete the application, so that renewal can be heard. I am currently working on completing the application. It may take me a little bit longer question. So I'll definitely have this completed tonight and sent over to you guys, I'm not sure, are we able to review the application as a as a renewal and they and they submit the paperwork tomorrow for before the next community board meeting. We could certainly I mean, as a committee, we can make any adjustments to conduct businesses as we see appropriate. I just want to. If we want to have the applicant answer, these questions orally, we can do so, but then we would want them to submit their paperwork. That would correspond to what was given us to us tonight to inform our decision. It sounds like the applicant can produce that information and have it sent to the office by tomorrow, but I will ask any comments from our committee members and their comfort level and doing it in this manner. At this time. Anybody have any issues or concerns about having this applicant present their renewal information as part of an oral submission. Will it be documented? Well, this meeting is being it's presented, live, so it's being recorded and documented it'll be documented in the meeting minutes as well. So how do we know that the paperwork is going to reflect what we said? Well, I can make the suggestion that any motion made would be contingent on submitting paperwork in advance of the full board meeting for ratification of any action items suggested out of this committee. Thank you. I support your recommendation. Chairman Ellis, thank you, miss Hyatt. I also support. Thank you all right, so I will also just clarify, because this was a 30-day. It was on the verge of a 30-day waiver that their renewal has probably already been made at the state level, but in efforts for us to do our due diligence and to review applications as a body, and we will certainly hear this information currently and may able to make any decisions based on this through an oral presentation and submitting our recommendations to the state based on the full board supporting any of our action items today. So let me ask the applicant to present themselves again. Where are you good evening? Everyone? My name is Joel Clacken. I am the manager for suite 704., all right Joel. So let me go through this with you, real quick, I'm going to make some I'm going to ask my co- chair, also to help me keep some documentation. I'm sure the board office is also keeping some notes, but let me go ahead and go through some of these renewal questions that we're usually interested in this circumstance. So remind us, the name of your establishment and the address the address is 704 nostrand avenue. The name is rain: Entertainment, Llc, Dba, 704 bar and the cross streets. The Cross Street is our prospect, place and St Marks. Okay, your current hours of operation, as previously approved the current hours that's previously approved, is that we, my sorry for the interruption. How long is this establishment? I'm looking at the wrong question? How long has this establishment been in operation since the December 2018.? That's when we officially opened our doors great, and this establishment is what category a restaurant bar a nightclub or a catering hall. It would be restaurant bar full service menu full kitchen, and is this licensed seeking a beer, insider beer, wine and cider or liquor beer wine inside the liquor beer wine insider? Who is the principal on the license? Fatima Stevenson? Thank you spell the first name, please, a t I b a b, a b is in boy, and last name is Stevenson. Is that with a v or Ph Stevenson with a v is in Victor? Thank you, Mr Mclachlan. Let's talk about your service area. What is your tables, how many tables and how many seats at those tables? Currently, our third certificate of occupancy is 70 and we do have two sides, so we have five tables on one side which seats five and we have. On the other side, we have smaller tables. So we have four tables that seat four and then three tables that see two. That's 25 seats on one side: that's in 22 seats on the other side, for a total of 47., that's correct, and what about your bar seating? How many bars and how many seats at the bar it's supposed to be 20 bar seating, 20 bar seats, obviously there's no bar service at this time, but just for everybody all right, so you said your your c of o for capacity is seven zero. Seventy we have two sides to our establishment and each side is seventy, so you have a combined capacity of a hundred and forty yes, sir, but seating for only 50 or 47.. We have very bulky furnitures, okay, and it takes up a lot of the space. It's the ambiance that we try to create. Okay, thank you and now your hours of operation that you went that you're seeking approval for, I believe the hours of operation that we had before was 11 A.M during the week 11 A.M to 2 A.M and then on weekends. It was from 11 A.M to 3 A.M Mr weatherwax. Can you confirm that from the previous archives? Ah give me a minute? Thank you. Well, Mr weatherwax is double checking that when you mean during the week, can you be more specific in the days Monday through Friday, so wait, Monday through Friday is till 2 am well actually Monday through Thursday is to 2 A.M Friday Saturday and Sunday it's to 3 A.M all right. While I wait for Mr wither Wax to confirm that preview, those previous hours, obviously operations mandated by the state at this time or till midnight for indoor and 11 for outdoors, do you have any outdoor space? Yes, we do. We have a rare yard, a rear yard, and can you please tell me the table logistics for that rear yard, as well as the hours of operation we currently have 12 tables in the where yard that seats. Four people, each obviously with a social distance, and we are only operating half of that. The rare yard is about 40 by 30 in size and just for our own edification, because you have two separate building spaces. Is that the adjoinment of two separate ear yards? Yes, sir they're both connected there's no barriers between it's just one yard. All right! Thank you for that. I get a little confused here because I'm not as familiar with no smooth avenue as some of our committee members, 704 and 706 news, trinidad Avenue we're actually we're actually 704 and 706 a so. Those are the two addresses that we occupy. Is I'm sorry Sir? Can you repeat that one more time please? Yes, yeah? Yes, Bob! This is gayle. Yes, thank you Gail! Thank you now. My notes do not have the a in it. So I sometimes I look up this address and I get 706 and the establishment at 706.. So I'm a little crossed acrosss purposes here, but no those hours of operations match what we first heard in April of 2018 and we approved them. Thank you. Oh sorry say that again, but what 2018 we first heard this establishment and we approved those hours of operations, 11 A.M to 2:11 A.M, to 3. great, thank you for the for the edification there, all right so just to back up, we do have confirmation on those hours as previously approved, the outdoor space is 48 seats at maximum capacity, but currently operating at 24. those hours of operation for your rear yard. Mr Mclachlan. Can you please review those? The rare yard is closed at 10 pm, 10 pm seven days a week, yes, Sir! Thank you all right. Moving along your sound system, can you please just let us know what kind of sound system and music programming that you have? Currently we have background music. That's all that we're operating on now, how many speakers there's four speakers inside you have speakers outside? No, not currently? Okay, that's usually not a proof! That's why I expressed a little bit of a shock. So all right! Thank you! Any live, entertainment being offered no live entertainment at the moment. I believe we are asking for it now due to the fact that you know with Covid-19 and we're trying to see whatever we can to try to maximize profit, but originally no, we have no live entertainment. It was literally just recorded music. Would you like to describe what live entertainment you're seeking to get approval for this application? Probably just a disc jockey, a band maybe and recorded music? Okay? Moving on your staffing program, how many service employees do you have employed? Currently we have 10 staff members. We have been able to keep them on even with the whole pandemic. We've been rotating and they've, been very diligent and you know staying with us through the thick intent, but we currently have 10. right. Thank you any security personnel not at the moment but original. Yes, we do have security personnel okay, but during this new business landscape you know you're, there's you do not see the need for having that. Okay, exactly any other security measures, cameras et cetera, we do have 12 cameras in the building and one out front and one in the wareyard. Thank you. Can any residences in your buildings left right or rear to the left of the building? Well, actually upstairs, there's a and to the left, there's businesses and to the right there's businesses and what about your rear yard? The building's backing up into your rear, the buildings directly in our rear is a residential building. There was a question in the chat I just want to confirm, so I clarity, there's been so anyway I'll come back to that. A second, oh! Let me get. Let me finish this up. Okay, any operational changes other than adaptations for Covid-19 operations, since you were here in December of 2018, no or since your last approval any other plans to other than your request for music programming any plans. No, it would just be the request for the music all right. Okay, so I was asked a question about live entertainment during Covid-19. I do believe it is somewhat restricted for ticketed events, but ancillary programming, I believe, is still currently allowed according to the SLA regulations, but there are social distancing regulations. I think musicians and entertainers have to be a minimum of 12 feet from many diners and they too have to be socially distant amongst themselves, so that was just a clarity that came directly to me as a question about music programming during special pandemic or special Covid-19 operations regulations. I hope that was a little clearer for that for that person that messaged me directly all right. So at this point, I'd like for any questions or comments from any of our community members that may be present uh-. Oh, we lost all right. I'm going to now open it up to any committee members that might have questions or comments to this application. Saunders, Brian, Hey, Mr sanders. Please proceed. Do you? Do you presently have a your license? Is active at this present moment? Oh no. Currently, our license is suspended at the moment. Okay, can you explain why your license is suspended? Sure on August 4th we had NYPD came into the building on August 4th in the building. We had a family from the same building same household, a friend of one of the own, a friend of the owners, and we had 10 people inside. We do realize that we made a mistake: we've been in communication with the state liquor authority, they did find us twenty thousand dollars and we do take full responsibility for that. We was under the assumption that, being that you know, the family members was from the same household that it would have been okay, but that was definitely a mistake on Iran and we do take full responsibility for it. Thank you for sharing and candor you take that Mr saunders does that satisfy your inquiry. Thank you. Any other questions or comments from committee members. Miss Tyus has the fine been paid? No ma'am, not at the moment we're currently working on getting it paid. Things have been a bit tough for us and you know we're definitely doing all we can to make sure that's taken care of as soon as possible, but we had to focus on this first. Thank you, mrias any other questions or comments. I'm officer vidal from the 77th president. Any questions for me in regards to SLA and the NYPD being in the place to clarify in regards to the summits that was issued. Sure would you like to offer anything I believe the summons was issued was for a second bar in the basement at the location it was issued by SLA. Actually, okay, noting here, that we have three on one complaints or noise coming from the backyard after 10 P.M, and I'm looking here that we did have a shooting back in three first and final location back. When was the date of this reported shooting February 1st all right will the applicant please address the issues that were raised by the 77th precinct representative, yes, so I'll definitely go ahead and address as far as the summons for the bar. Yes, we did get a summons for the bar, but that was not the reason why the liquor license was suspended. It was not mentioned in the liquor license. We did get a thomas for the bar from the NYPD and the night that the NYPD did come into our establishment. The little authority was not present on that night and that was on August 1st. I believe it was, I think I said, August 4th first, but it was on August 1st that the NYPD came into the building, just the NYPD, not the state, Liquor Authority. I believe this information was forwarded to the state Liquor Authority, and the decision at the moment was made to temporarily suspend our liquor license. As far as the 311 calls we have been in communication with our neighbors, we have their phone numbers, they do text us whenever there's any kind of noise. Obviously we do have people in the backyard who are still somewhat dining after 10 pm, just finishing up their dinner and sometime. They do talk and laugh and do get a bit loud. So I believe that's where the noise complaint comes in. In recent recently, we've covered put a tarp on the backyard to actually help keep the sun and the rain out, but that has been helping to keep the noise level down as well. Also, as far as the shooting is concerned, there was a shooting in front of our establishment- and I remember speaking with the detective- and the detective specifically mentioned, that it was just pure coincidence. The person that whoever it was that was shooting at had recently been released from jail, and this is what was told to us by the detective when they came in, they got a call saying that there was someone that was shot that was in the hospital they went to do their investigation when they came back. They said it's just pure coincidence. The person that the victim he had just recently got out of jail. I guess someone in the neighborhood got a whiff that he was released from jail and he just happened to be walking past our establishment at the time that the shooting happened. So this was not directly at our establishment. It was just a coincidence that the person was walking past our establishment when it happened. Thank you for addressing those concerns. Any questions one moment, Mr Williams. Let me just see if there's any other committee or were we I know we are under. We are on committee yep, so Mr Wax, please go ahead. Do you have a Sec car in your basement? There is it's not a second bar. We have in the basement, it's a fashion bar. It has the logo of the business it's not being used. It was not being used. Even when the state Liquor Authority came in and the NYPD came in, the bar was not being used. It's just for it has beautiful lights. It goes with the decor, it's just for fashion, no, sir, even with their pitches and everything that they took. There was no drinks being served or prepared behind that bar. There was no one behind that bar. Is there any product at that bar? No there's no product at the bar all right? I will remind the applicant that, yes, you are obligated by the SLA laws and regulations to make sure you disclose any additional service points of service, whether they be temporary points of service for seasonal or private parties or rear yards for outdoor service. But you are obligated to disclose additional service points. Yes, Ms Ellis. We did have that conversation with the state liquor authority when they came in and our lawyer is actually in the process of working and getting those taken care of at the moment. Do you have intentions on adding that fashion bar to your service plan? Not we do have to get all the paperwork done. First and yes, so eventually we will want to add that area as a part of the the building. Okay. As a reminder to you as you go through that process, you will, you will be asked obligated to present any changes to your operations to this committee anytime, that you're ready to make those moves. Yes, that was definitely explained to us as well, and we most certainly will thank you very much. That would not be any time soon. It would definitely be after Postcovid. Thank you for that. Any other questions or comments from our committee members. That's Ms, Collins, Miss, collins! Please go ahead. Something then was the summons was given to you, even though there was no evidence of service at that bar in the basement. Yes, ma'am. So again, the bar was not operational. There was no one behind the bar, the lights were on and there were people in the building, so that was the reason why the summons was given when the NYPD came in, they did not find any evidence. What the gentleman told us was that he definitely have to give us something, and this is you know verbatim, he has to give us something. So what he gave us was the bar downstairs. So everything else that was on the suspension was never discussed with us in the building. When NYPD was there, it was just the bar, so it came as a surprise on August 4th when we receive a suspension for everything else. His comment was: he had to give you something, even if it did not, it was not warranted. That's so unfair again. The only thing that was told to us was that he has to give us something. That was the only comment that was made and that's when we got the summons for the bar for the second bar downstairs, which again was never operational. Thank you any other questions from committee members. All right. I would if there are no other questions. I will ask many our committee members to make a motion or begin a discussion around emotion. I say emotion is supported and let's and let's go on and with restrictions that they provide the necessary paperwork in a timely manner before their next meeting. All right, there's a motion made by Mr Thurton. Does anybody to make us a second or any other comments? I I'm Miss young yeah a couple of questions. First of all, did I know he was going to be working on his application. Did he complete it and get that in yeah did that come through Mr Ellis? I have not seen anything in my inbox, yet we also kind of hi. We preemptively said: let's go through this orally okay, under the understanding that he would send a an updated and thorough written application. Once you move through this okay. The other question you have is related to the fine. Oh you were you wanted to answer. I'm sorry, did you want to respond to my question? Yeah, I'm sorry Miss young! No! I was just simply saying that I will have the application completed tonight and sent over to the Community Board. Okay, fine, okay! Well, let me okay, all right! That's a separate sidebar with respect to the fine. What I know it's a hefty fine. What are you working on and how do you plan to satisfy that? We're definitely working on putting some money together from operations, but at the same time we are you know reaching out to you, know family members and getting you know putting together every resource that we can to get this taken care of as soon as possible, so we could get back to somewhat normal operation. Okay, I I'm struggling with this, because I certainly understand that things happened and I'm not making any judgment about what occurred at your establishment, and I want to be some supportive, I'm just not sure what options we have to and I reached this is really to the committee to try to support him with what some kind of stipulations, but I'm not so sure what they should look like I mean, certainly adhering to the rules, would be one of them. So I do not know- and I'm asking for the committee some other thoughts around what I'm trying to frame I'd like to support the recommendation, but I also think that there needs to be some restrictions to ensure that all things are in order and that they remain in compliance. Definitely, since we have gotten our license suspended and since opening back up for indoor dining, we have taken all the necessary precaution to make sure that we're you know maintaining social distance and we're doing everything that the governor requested of us. So you know we definitely understand. We know that we made a mistake and we're doing everything in our power to definitely try to fix that our employees have been more than diligent in helping us to make sure that is done as well. But yes, we do make. We do know that we made a mistake and we fully accept the mistake that we made and the penalty, and this is the reason why we've been you know, trying our best to make sure that this get paid as well. But it was a. It was a mistake that we made and we're trying to do everything we can to fix that and move forward. Okay. Well, I thank you for sharing that. So with that now listen I'm getting ready to support the motion on the floor. Please do not make me have to work harder and come into your st. I have been in your establishment, so do not make me have to come in there every two days. Well, I think that was the effort of Miss Young. She was getting. I know she seconded it hold on one. Second, I think that there was a motion made by Mr Thurton. I think Young had some questions right and some clarity before she offered a second. So I did not hear in a second though right. Am I correct in saying Miss Young that you are willing and now ready to second Mr Kirk's motion? Yes, I am now willing and ready to second Mr Thurton's motion. Thank you, you're welcome. Are there any questions to this motion? Yes, this is ethel pious, hi Mr. Yes, please proceed the question. I have I'm not clear what happened to font. His license was suspended, that's right and the fine is not paid. That's all he's got. I imagine if you want to add that you're in the midst of ameliorating, that with the SLA right now and putting yourself on a payment timeline or has your license been reinstated. No, our license have not been reinstated, but this literally took place about two and a half weeks ago, so we just got the the necessary information and what our fines is about two weeks ago. So this is the reason why we're now working on getting everything paid. So my remaining question is: should the committee support this licensed renewable? He would still not be able to do business and minus pay in the suspension is lifted. That's correct, I mean we were definitely told that we would not even be able to do business without a renewal. So even if we do pay the 20,000 that we, you know trying so hard to find. If we do not get a renewal, then that 20,000 would definitely be in vain, so we would definitely have to go through the renewal process as well, and this is the reason why I'm here today he's not putting the cart before the horse. No okay, I need some clarification, so he could open as a restaurant, minus alcohol correct, that's correct all right. So if that is the case, my position still remains to support the motion that was made, because how is he supposed to generate the money to pay the fine? If he can't do business, we need to give him an opportunity to rectify he's already apologized. He knows he made a mistake and he's going to take corrective actions from what I'm hearing so I'd like to see him have an opportunity to make the money he needs to make to pay the fine. Thank you for that. Miss, young Miss collins. Do you have a response? No! Are there any other questions on this motion? We do have an active motion with a second sorry: I'm not able to monitor the hands one second Miss Weatherspoon. I will get back to you, but I'm going to let Gail proceed. Okay, mine is not a question. I think I just like some clarity. What Debbie just said and what the Mr Clapton said he can do business. He can open as a restaurant. He just can not sell alcohol. He wants the renewal because, even if he, if he does not have the renewal and he pays the fine, he can not get a liquor license. So he needs to lick a license. He needs to be able to renew, even though he's not going to be selling liquor until the fight is paid now. Is that is that correct, yeah? I'm sorry Mr, let's go ahead. I said I was just going to ask the applicant to respond to Miss Branch Mohammed's question. Yes, that's definitely correct so currently we're unable to serve alcohol and we've just been operating as a restaurant since August 4.. Now it's just a coincidence that this happened around the same time that our liquor license goes up for renewal. If we do not get the liquor license, renewal we'll be paying the 20,000 fine for no reason at all, because we can't operate coming down from you know our lawyer. We have to definitely take care of our renewal first and then take care of the suspension or do both if we have the money, but we were you know we wanted to make sure that this is taken care of, because if we do not get the renewal, then even if we paid a fine for the suspension, it would not even be worth anything because we'll still need the that's kind renewal putting the horse above the carriage above the horse. But you know we've been given a situation and we just have to do the best we can at it. Okay, thank you now that makes sense to me that makes sense, Miss, Weatherspoon you're. Next, what time frame do you have to pay off your fine? I believe they give us 30 days after accepting is accepting what is what are you speaking of the fines, so whether you want to take the finer if you want a trial, you do not want to trial. You have to pay your 20,000 fine in 30 days, yes, Ma'am. I believe it's 30 days. I would have to clarify with our lawyer again, but I do believe it's 30 days. Thank you all right, any other questions making sure that we're thinking about this motion just for another reminder. This motion has been made to support the application is orally presented. It has been seconded as well, and I believe it's as stated before, we went through this process that the applicant would submit a hard copy paperwork reflecting these responses to the board office by tomorrow. No other questions or comments. I'm asked Mr Witherwax vote on this motion. I would just observe that if we do and that do not pay the fine they're not serving that we're not holding the SLA, so let's be, lest we think otherwise, all right Mr Allison, I'm Miss French Muhammad. Yes, thank you! No mister! I'm abstaining. Mr Puka, yes, thank you, Mr saunders. What was that about? Mr saunders? Yes, thank you. Miss Tyus, yes, reluctantly! Thank you! Mr Fakoni, that's pain. No! Yes, the motion passes seven in favor, two of those three abstentions, all right now that has gone through I'd like to just address the applicant from this committee in this body. I will share from my seat and not and I'm this is a personal opinion. It's disappointing to hear these incidences that have happened in your establishment. It's disappointing to hear that there was disregard for the mandated regulations due to this current business landscape. I encourage you to be more diligent and more thoughtful about your operations, moving forward, keeping in mind the community that we're also all dealing with at this time in this kind of unique circumstances and the rear yard noise levels, the the appearance of disregarding states and city regulations does not bode well. As we move forward and as a new establishment, that's already come under scrutiny. I will certainly say that you're on the radar for other agencies to continue doing enforcement checks. Sorry, one! Second, all right as I continue to pass the sirens, so I just really want to enforce that. You know this committee and this body of community members are encouraging our restaurants and bar establishments to be successful, but only under the guise of operating under the recurrent regulations that are allowable. So it is again, I I'd say from my seat a little disappointing to hear the the disregard for those enforcements and those regulations in the past, and I hope that this conversation and this experience will help you move forward in making the appropriate actions and changes in your operations to be compliant. Thank you, Mr Ellison, and thank you to the rest of the community board. I you know I do want to ensure you that everything that everyone has you know said to us tonight will definitely be taken with with into consideration. We have definitely as of late change. The way we operate- and you know everyone understands that these are things that we definitely have to abide by and we've been making changes. I had a meeting with all the staff two weeks ago and we went to we went through different procedures on how we'll be operating moving forward. This way, we're not putting anyone life into jeopardy and we're not putting our business into jeopardy. So we definitely understand James. I just like I'm sorry. I would just like to add that I distinctly remember when they came before the board originally and asked Answer liquor license and they were given a difficult time and they had to come back, and I remember that the Minister from before Central came forward and spoke on their behalf, and I think that it's important that the manager, as well as the owners of the business, take this very seriously and do the right thing, because twenty thousand dollars is a lot of money to have to pay, and I it's difficult enough staying in business and having that kind of fine above your head makes it that much more difficult. So I wish you well and understand that it was not easy for us for some of us to vote. Yes, but again we wanted to see the business maintained. You have a wonderful establishment or it looks aesthetically, it's very nice and we hope that you do well, but you must abide by city and state rules. Thank you. Thank you. James. May I ah Mr Thurton please proceed yeah from my perspective. We're definitely pushing hard for the growth of Nostran and and for your establishment. We will put emphasis that you do abide by the by the regulations and and whatever is needed to be done. Could you please take care of issues that you have immediately so that we do not have any issues on Nashville Avenue, because we do have a ways to go and we are looking for the growth of nostrand and everyone is involved, so we definitely want you to be part of it in a positive way so that we do not in our next meeting. We do not have to go through any issues. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mister. Thank you. Mr Thornton, and you know I just want to you know just clarify. Within the past couple months, we have formed a Nostril, restaurant and Bar association, and this has also been helping us to make sure making sure that you know we are going over all the issues within the neighborhood that Us, restaurant and bars are facing, and you know what we can do moving forward to. You know, help protect ourselves and also pulling resources together to make sure that all the businesses have the mask, and you know, thermometers and everything that they need in order to run the business properly. So, yes, we're definitely taking the proper steps to move forward. Again, we did make some. You know stupid mistakes in the past, but you know I really do not want that to be a low- hanging fruit over our head. You know, while we try to do better well, thank you and I and I appreciate your candidness and responding to these questions. It is a unique time and your circumstances have really highlighted some of the obstacles that businesses are facing. But once again, please do not let us regret making this decision as a committee and seeing that our trust and your application to move forward in an operational manner that is compliant. I will also remind you, as an applicant and any other applicants that are still here, that these recommendations will be will be presented at the full board meeting and we'll also need the support of the community. The full community board. That meeting will be Thursday, October 8th, which is, I believe, this week. The information for that teleconference can be obtained from the board office, and they should probably be sending you out the appropriate information to join us. It won't be a presentation of your full application. It will only be a recommendation from this committee and we want you present to be able to answer any questions if any of the community members or any of our board members have directed for you. So, thank you for calendaring that on Thursday October, 8th, okay, I want to make sure that there is no other applicants in the room on this teleconference that we might have overlooked through the jumping around I'm making a last call for any applicants, all right azer. Do we want to make any motions for any outstanding renewals, Mr Witherwax I'll, ask you. We have 150 for Utica right. I think that's the only one! That's the create she was joined us in the beginning and then she fell off. So I'm not sure what her plans were. Miss Neil. Did you get any community follow- up communications from her on her renewal application? No, I did not know and the only other October renewal for omarino, which we took care of already and good 706 washington, oh, but they did not present right. I do not believe they did and they may have done an alteration that changes their time. You know did send their information sheet. It's in our records. We, I have not received anything from good life. If they're up in October were not, they are not they mandated by a 30-day notification. I've only gotten one 30-day notice of intent to apply for a liquor license right now and it's actually for a new application. I do not have any renewals so far, but notices will have to go out shortly, though, for the November meeting- and you said mister with Wax good life was October or November. I have them as an October renewal, you know, but I have it at 706 mezcal and I'm not sure what happened with the remember. They changed ownership. There may have been a oh, an extension. A reset like it might have started to clock for them. Yes, 706 good life. I think they had the 500 foot hearing less than a year ago or just up to a year ago. I do not think they they should be up for renewal yet, but well, I would say good life, 706 Washington, I'm just glad had their 500-foot hearing about a year ago, but 706 mezcal. They did sell to good life, but Pequena's. If that is Ellen Fishman's place, then they did send their information sheet to us. They were on the agenda for last month. Amarino you mean oh yeah, okay, yep, I'm going to yep, that's mine! Thank you just for understanding, so if they did a management change or an ownership change, and they had their review a year ago, then that would have probably started a new two- year. Clock for them for renewal. Is that what we're doing that's correct? Good life is now owned by the same people. I believe that own ode to Babel right, it's marv, that's Marva and Martin yeah. I do not want to take up too much committee time with this, but this is very interesting. I'm on the SLA website, their initial application for an on- premises, full liquor license is still classified as pending they've been doing month to month to month licenses for May June July August September. So I do not know why, but they are they're. Their current month to month expires on the 16th of October. Okay, let me see Miss Neil. Can we just do it? Can we just check in with marva and her and them over there to see where they're at and have them give us an update, sure our records the last time? Well, we sent the letter to the state liquor authority for their support in June 2019. The 500-foot hearing was scheduled for September October 2019, but I will definitely say Julia's right. I think this is just a hangover from when it was the prior establishment, so they are probably on an entirely new cycle. 706 was it started out as minor arcana and then it was bar 706 and then good life took over in 2019. You know: they've actually had a few issues with that location, keeping a tenant in there, but I will definitely not a problem. Send Miss, Babel and email requests are on top of it if they're doing these monthly renewals, but I'm just curious why their on- premises license was filed in February of 20 2020 February of this year. Okay, I will, I will send an email, not a problem, all right- and I just want to. I think, let me double check that this is that the Miss Neil put into the chat the agenda for the full meeting on Thursday, just as a reminder of what we're going to be covering. We are going to be reviewing our budget. Our capital and expense budget request for fiscal year 22., so your participation is requested as well as all applicants are expected to be there to review this committee's work today I do see- and I want to just not to put anybody on the spot, but Mr Kearney you're you're. I see you have a title after your name. Are you here with a another applicant or are you a community member of Cbh? Thank you for speaking with me, I'm actually here just listening to the community, I'm a former prosecutor with the SLA, so I'm opening a full service law firm and I'm just trying to hear the issues and get to see the actual participants in all of the communities. Oh great, thank you again. My apologies for putting you on the spot, but with I just was making sure that we were not overlooking a representative from a business that we were unable to hear from today. So I wanted to make sure and since you're one of the few that decided to be on camera the whole time, it also highlighted your presence. So, thank you again for speaking to me great at this point. I want to ask for many committee members or community members. If there's any questions or comments or any concerns they'd like to raise in this forum before we adjourn yes, Gail did we share about the end bar and for Saturday right ahead. Yes, we did the last minute, but please debbie. Oh okay provide additional information. Okay, just so everyone will know this saturday from 12 to 6 crown Heights North Association is introducing nbar and we have a series we're having an opening ceremony which is going to be at 706 nostrand at 12 noon. We have three establishments along notion, avenue that will be doing music so from 12 to 2. There will be music at 706 at two to four blue finn will be having live music and from four to six sweet bar. I think sweet bar is going sweet, Brooklyn, I'm sweet, Brooklyn, Bob, sorry is going to be having music. They are also offering a 10 discount at establishing businesses along the notion corridor. So we ask people, you know to spread the word and please come out and join us as we try to you know, introduce an ocean avenue and get people to come out and frequent the establishments. Thank you. Anybody want to add anything. Gail did I forget anything yes and besides bars and restaurants, there's also other merchants on Notion Avenue and it's from Atlantic Avenue into Eastern. Parkway is Deborah, hey and thanks for sharing that it's very exciting, to see noester avenue, merchants rising up and trying to coalesce as a singular voice and advocacy for their needs as business operators. So please, if you're available and able to swing by Nostrand Avenue. If you have not been on northern avenue in a while, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised about the rise and activity and vitality there, and so encourage you guys to check out some of the new establishments along that corridor in our in our district, any other questions or comments from community members or committee members. Before we adjourn, I see that berkey came on camera. I assume that you have something you'd like to add. I do hi my name's rachel. I'm a member of the community- and I just wanted to join you all tonight, to express my support for Miss Vivian, who was very, we think my community members and I all think rudely kicked off of vanderbilt after she did a lovely job of serving jerk chicken and fried fish on Saturday. We heard through the grapevine and that it was because a quote-, unquote, restaurant group complained about her and it just feels incredibly uncommunity- like that. Someone who's been known to the community for so long would be so rudely booted off the street when so many other establishments are, you know, there's live music on vanderbilt all the time and we've had I've had lovely interactions with members. Interrupt you for a second. This individual was selling food was transacting food out on the streets, yes, Miss Vivian she had, she does jerk chicken. She has the licenses for everything and but she's, not a brick and mortar okay. That is apparently what the big complaint was, and I'm sorry to be the bearer of this news. But in these circumstances of the open streets, restaurants, there's very much a very deep level of prescriptions on what's allowed and what's not allowed- and it sounds like this might have been a violation of that permitting process as unfortunate as it is- and I understand your point of what you're saying about this long- standing community member, but I do not. I just want to make sure that we understand that there might have been a violation of rules because of open sales of restaurants. Due to this permit, I will ask if he's available and interested to say anything Mr, Bocconi, who's, part of the prospect heights ndc, that's one of the sponsor organizations for the open, restaurants, sure yeah, it's true. There are very specific rules about what's permitted during open streets, restaurants. The real issue here is, although the street is closed to traffic, all the other laws of New York City are still in effect. It's illegal in New, York City to have an open fire in the street selling food in the street requires a vendor permit for the street and the problem that we have. First of all, let me just say for those of you who have not had a chance to visit open streets, restaurants on Vanderbilt Avenue, it's been tremendously successful for the businesses there. Now we began this because we were interested in trying to keep as many of those businesses afloat through the pandemic as possible, and it's working now we're coming down to the end of it I mean not. The mayor has announced that it will be permanent, but from a practical point of view there are not that many more weekends we can run this and one of the one of the real problems we have is that people see an open street and see wow. This is great. This looks like it's something for me. I can come and I can play my music. I can come and sell some food. I can sell something else. The simple fact is those things are not permitted and for people to come and take them on themselves. To do them really risks are being able to manage the event. This event is managed with no budget whatsoever. We have 33 volunteers that marshal it during the weekend and they're, not in a position to be able to mediate among all the people who decide that they'd rather run their own program. During the event we just can't, we just can't accommodate it. We risk being shut down by the city, and that would be a result that would be very damaging to our restaurants. So I I'm sorry, I did speak to miss Vivian on Sunday. She. I asked the folks at foodtown to give her my phone number and she called me- and I did speak to her about this, and I also put her in touch with a small business advocacy group at impact Brooklyn to try to help her get grants for her own business, but unfortunately, when some food, anyone else can look at that and point to it and say then it's okay. For me, too, and the minute we have a half a dozen open fires going on the avenue with people selling their own barbecue. We do not have an event anymore, so I'm sorry that your perception was that it was uncommunity- like, but really what community is in this case is understanding the purpose of the event and why it was organized and who it has to support, and if it can't, if people want to do things that run counter to that purpose, we have to ask them to stop. We just we just do not have a choice. I'm and I'm sorry about it, but that's how it is. We do have people who do things that are non- compliant. We try our best to keep them in line. It's not an easy job and the fact that people are doing things that are non- compliant from time to time does not mean that anyone gets to write their own ticket. That is not community. Let me tell you that right now. Thank you. Thank you. Mr Verconi and Miss Berkey. Thank you for expressing your concern and bringing that to our attention. Unfortunately, the circumstances being what they are with the permitting process preclude type of activity from happening in that area, totally understand that it really I'm concerned. As a community member that you know, I've been participating in open streets as a as a guest the whole time. It's been wonderful, like it's really been wonderful to see the restaurants, be able to stay open and expand, how much seating they have etcetera. I'm concerned, aside from the fact that we all love, miss Vivian. The fact that what we heard on Sunday through the you know, neighborhood rumor mill, was that the community mount the Community board, went to miss Vivian and said well, the guys behind olmstead called you in, and it's about what happened. I understand that. It's absolutely not what happened. Let me finish. Let me finish what I'm saying is that it created this like rumor mill thing where suddenly people were excuse, my language complaining pitching and moaning about the gentrifying restaurants in prospect heights, and it just creates a lot of animosity amongst community members that I think the open streets like we're all trying to avoid like that is we want to support all these local communities, and I do not know if it's that more people need. I honestly only knew that the community board was behind because, first of all, let me clarify one. Second, the community board is not involved with any of the permitting of open streets on either on any of the districts doing that it is something that is done by local neighborhood folks and, like local excuse me, hi Cheryl one. Second, that's okay. Give me one second, we'll circle back to you. I just want to clarify the county board. Is not the agency or the group that has applied for these open streets. These are done by local neighborhood groups under the auspice of volunteerism. I need someone to mute their cheryl. Can you mute your phone please or your video? Thank you. Yes, and so one thing. Oh there you're me. I think it's the person on whose number begins with two zero one. Two, that's talking! Oh that's! Mr! Puka! Can you mute? Please thank you. So that's an unfortunate under that's an unfortunate circumstances that the misunderstanding is that, and I would hope that you would take this newfound information and share back to any of those concerned parties that it is not the community board that applied for the open streets. Nor was it the community board that had an issue or any violations with Ms Vivian, obviously, there's extenuating circumstances and in the cases Mr Viconia explained. This was a process and it's about being compliant with the current permits to allow for open streets, restaurant to activate on vanderbilt and it's unfortunate circumstances, and I hope that with you and your my your micro community, that you discuss this with you. Let them know that it was not the Community Board of eight or any members of that community board eight representing the board and that it is an application separate from the Community board's actions and activities I'll have to find Mr. Tony's word be the one for saying who reported who and where that, where the issue was raised from I'm not certain. I well I'll, tell you exactly where it came from. We have. We have volunteer marshals that patrol the streets and they saw this and said: hey. We've got somebody running an open barbecue on Vanderbilt Avenue. What do we do? What had happened there was that the folks at foodtown, who we love and who do great things in the community, were approached by Ms Vivian and asked if she could come out and run a barbecue on Vanderbilt Avenue. They thought it'd be a great idea and we had to exchange them. It's not such a great idea. It's going to really it's illegal and it's going to potential problem for us she's. We can't allow her to continue, and that is exactly what happened. I can tell you. I personally had several phone calls with the food Hoax on Saturday and again I think if you, if you look at it from the point of view of what would mean if we just let people cook their, you know, build a barbecue on Vanderbilt Avenue people have a manageable situation very quickly. We're already you know we're. We have a couple other issues, we're dealing with there right now and the number one thing that we're trying to we're trying to be able to do is to resolve these things. So people understand what the path of the event is. We do not want to involve police in anything that happens on Vanderbilt Avenue, we're dependent on people showing their good will towards the businesses of our community and not trying to take it away for themselves for some other purpose. However, mobile, that's just the way we have to run it, and if you want somebody, if you want somebody to throw under the bus I'll, send you my phone number and you can have anybody call me you want. May I have this one? Yes go ahead: Miss Collins, Hi, Miss Berkey. Can you tell us? When is this vivian still selling her fish, and you know where she usually has she's? She does the drinks in the park and that kind of thing she's a caterer in the community. He does not have a brick and mortar right like do you know what she's usually in traffic for her? Yes, you know a part I do not. I have not run into her. My friends have yeah. Okay. Thank you all right. I need to bring us back since Miss Cheryl Smith has joined us from Cheryl's global soul. It looks like she's having some video audio video issues, but awesome. If you want to unmute, I just want to kind of bring you up to speed on what went down while with your application. Are you going to hear us and communicate? I do not know it looks like she might have. Cheryl Smith is going to be able to hear us, but just I'll just let the Community Board office inform you of what went down here today. I think there was an email sent to you to update your if you'd like to update hours operation. Miss collins. Can you mute? Please sorry. So if you could hear us, Ms Smith just check in with the Community Board aid office for the updates on your renewal application that was approved by this body this evening and will be submitted to the full board on Thursday at this point, if there's no other open any new business or old business. I just want to thank everybody for joining us tonight. I appreciate everybody's due diligence and reviewing these applications. I also want to k. I want to express my thanks to all the applicants that are continuing to invest during this kind of on this questionable period in business in community board eight, and if there's nothing else, I'd like to make a motion to Adjourn. Second, oh yeah, all right have a great evening. Everybody we'll see you Thursday night on the full board meeting. Please review the capital budget stuff in advance, because we won't be doing that on the teleconference. Thank you have a good night good evening. You.
