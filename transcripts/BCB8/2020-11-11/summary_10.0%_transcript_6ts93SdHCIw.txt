So, therefore, HPD is proposing to fulfill the 80-100 unit, commitment on site b and that we're able to provide an opportunity for another affordable program on site, a which is helping us with the furthering fair housing.
I think we've heard from numerous we've heard from numerous engagements, or rather materials and stakeholders that there is a need for affordable units in this community and so addressing the or fulfilling the senior commitment on site.
These sites, we've analyzed other zoning designations, and so we want to gather your feedback about the design elements like heights in bulk, which can vary to influence the look and feel of the building.
And we look at different combinations of that to allow us to fit the minimum threshold of the units and the square footage that goes with these community facilities and open space that we want to achieve here in addition to delivering feasible, projects.
We, do also still want to optimize the site here, so our other HPD programs also have other minimum units at for financial feasibility.
We do not have programming the need for heights and bulks that are identified in the R7A zoning in order to optimize the site for all of these goals that we want to achieve, and so we also wanted to note that, in our analysis.
But there were a lot of questions with that process, so I wanted to clarify that the HPD process is a little different from that.
The last thing on this is that developers also documents such as a land, disposition, agreement and regulatory agreements that hold them to specific the specified program and the affordability and then, on the last thing, before over, to Q&A statistics about vacancy rates in the area and New York, City, overall and sort of the concern about why we're proposing new construction house what seems to be vacancy rates.
So I know people were sending questions in as she was talking hold on a second.
Think we should let the person ask the question because I see in the chat.
You maybe answered this question, but it was whether the because you talked about the number of units that you're aiming to create in the building in site.
I understand that HPD has not yet figured out what population they're going to target for it, but I guess my concern would just be that if it's going to have I, my hope would be that it would be a hundred percent extremely affordable, because I mean it's just such a huge opportunity there with a piece of land that belongs to the city.
Have questions about the zoning envelope, but I'm sure other people are going to ask it.
Kind of like get people's ideas on for this RFP and that's what this community outreaches for, and certainly we just Wanna, be able to take advantage of this opportunity to give as much affordable, housing.
Everyone who lives in this neighborhood knows, we've been there's been construction going on for the last 10 years on the Atlantic Yards Project Pacific park, barclay center, all of that, but 17 high-rises, and it's been really.
Why has an HPD done a serious study into the feasibility of transforming some of those spaces into affordable housing which could be done much more quickly and would cost much less city money.
Then you could use the HPD lots either for low-rise housing or for open space, which this community desperately needs.
That's, a really good idea in looking at you know: converting commercial and vacant residential to affordable, housing.
Think for now we have to kind of plan for these two sites that have been underutilized by the city for a really long, time, and so.
Show the need in this neighborhood show the need to build on those specific sites and specify exactly what you plan to do before you issue an RFP I think this is bordering on arbitrary and capricious.
I. Think you know: we've been tasked to try to create quality, affordable housing across the neighborhood and across the city on city-owned land and because of city-owned land.
You know that we have a commitment for senior housing on one of the sites.
You know their designs of the site based on feedback we're hearing from community during this period amassing and such and also they're.
You know to expand the passive open space there, so we're not building on the priority of the city-owned land.
So I think you know like with a lot of rfps.
You, know, intention to build 100, affordable housing on these two sites.
Then we're asking people to come back with their ideas that you know the best idea and the best building that fits into this neighborhood and what we hear from.
I know that there's a lot of people who've asked multiple questions.
And I wanted to know why it's not using the full parking lot in its footprint and also just the practical question about the survey on the HPD website.
Many of us support deeply affordable senior housing, but we would like any kind of zoning change or a large construction to be looked at in a much more holistic, way, and I'd like to comment on that.
You know it's the policy and also we actually do not have a lot of land in neighborhoods like this.
We really think it's irresponsible, particularly to ask a community to support a proposal that is, at this point vague in terms of hey what the zoning is and b how broad that zoning would be.
Both of these sites are mid plot, so we need to discuss sort of the zoning rationale with Ccp. It is hard to give a you know a real answer to that question on what the zoning district and boundaries are at.
The developer has to do an environmental assessment statement which looks at the impact of not just the proposed buildings on the city sites, but depending on where the zoning boundary is how that rezoning would impact the sites are being included in the district.
Just you know: I, mean it's irresponsible to say like yeah, the district is going to go to the avenues.
It was the same process there, but in our case for the disposition of city land and for the rezoning that would be needed for the project that we're proposing, you know would require an environmental assessment.
You know the two and two affordable buildings on these two sites.
I think so, just one other question, so the quote-unquote commitment for 80-100 units on these specific sites.
I want to just first to just explain, because I think I also agree strongly with this notion that we need a holistic plan before this proceeds, but I have some zoning questions, but the zoning.
You're, adding in you know, thousands and thousands of units of six thousand four thousand six thousand four hundred thirty units of housing, potentially and maybe a little less if some of the buildings are not completed and 2,250 of those affordable units plus a lot of empty.
We have a lot of different issues that need to be addressed, and what we see here in with M Crown was a proposal to address these things with looking at zoning across the district, but also in looking at public realm potential public realm improvements, and these HPD sites were included in those.
You can look at the ratios and you'll see that we do not have the space for pedestrians, that a lot of other areas have or the we have, and we have a bunch of like design flaws in the project atlantic yards which are going to directly even impact on these sites, like you have just at the dean and carlton intersection on Dean, Street.
I mean we need to be thinking about this holistically and really talking about what the community needs are in a different way than I.
I hear you saying and because we are actually the neighborhood, the immediate area, that's carrying a lot of the weight of the new, affordable housing and the new development.
So you know the city can't keep having the same idea over and over without addressing the things that we need addressed at the same time.
We strongly support the use of these sites for senior, affordable, housing.
Actually, I would say that both sites should be used for senior affordable housing, but at the end of the day.
Definitely taking notes here on what you're saying I want to make sure that we are understanding your just because it we did hear a lot of concerns.
That means you guys know what zoning envelope you want.
You know I, think that would that would just result in a financially and feasible project here and because we want to optimize.
We are looking for a larger zoning envelope, but one that is not out of scale with the surrounding neighborhood, and some of the buildings like right across the street.
Think if catherine wanted to step in I know, we had talked about the.
We are looking at financial feasibility as well, which is going to result in on proposing more use on that site than the current zoning allows.
You know I share in the desire for answers about the zoning envelope that it kind of seems like from what I understand from what you're saying.
I mean I know that everybody has tons of meetings, but I'm wondering if there could be another meeting where DCP could be here to answer questions about the zoning envelope.
A lot of people talked about what a tremendous asset it is to have city-owned land in our area that could be turned into affordable, housing.
So I think the way we imagine this for most of our city, sites.
And, but we do have like lawyers looking into this question, because it is definitely something a lot of community groups across the city and non-profit developers.
The senior, affordable, housing error on one site.
