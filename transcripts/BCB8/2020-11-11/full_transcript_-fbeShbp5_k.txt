The former President George, H.W, Bush and now sully, is being reckoned good evening. Everyone. Thank you all for coming on time. I see the housing committee chair is with us. Ms Granville, you're, muted, am I, still muted I see I can't tell anyone. Can you hear me go ahead? I can hear you now go ahead. Okay, good evening, everyone I was hoping one of our committee members who has not been able to join in so hopefully with the information I gave him he's going to call in he'll be able to join for the first time in about three months, so I'm sorry for being late. So, as everyone probably noticed, this is a joint meeting of the Housing Advocacy Committee and the land use. You need a community board committee, so we're here to hear from HPD and I'm hoping they are ready to start. If we have a quorum, looks like we do. Yes, hi, I'm kathryn I will be sharing the presentation from HPD. If somebody could give me access to share my screen, that'd be great. Okay, I'm going to depend on district manager, george or community Liaison Julie Emile. To do that, can you give us your last name? Yes, tavares! Thank you! Okay, Ms George! Are you available to give her the ball so to speak, miss tavares. You should be able to share your screen. This is a meeting not an event. Thank you. Okay, just going to need a minute, not very familiar with webex I visited the the website and just for simplicity. I did just give you the ball so now you should be able to not only share your screen, but also to share content. Okay, I'm able to do that, but I actually have to log off in order to give my laptop permission to do so. I will be right back. Okay, while that's being done. I do not know if the rest of the audience has had a chance to go back to the HPD website on the project and take a look at the information they've posted from the last webinar of sorts that they use to gather the information. I thought it was fairly well put together, so they do seem to be making progress on pulling that data out so that we could take a close look at it. I hope you have done that revisitation to that website and have some structured questions to ask this evening. Can you hear me? Yes, okay, I just wanted to welcome everyone to the meeting it's the night before holiday, so I know you had things to do, but we're happy that you decided to spend your time with us. Our hope is that your concerns will be addressed and that you will walk away knowing more than you did when you sat down that's what we try to do is to make sure that you get all the information that you need. So my name is Miss Granville and welcome to the meeting and I'm hoping that, like I said, everyone gets their concerns and their questions answered. I'm going to ask you to please give the ladies. Your attention hold your questions until the end. Please. Thank you. So far we have 42 people on the call I think that's a fairly good turnout for the euler session. We had yesterday evening with the land use director for the ball. President Richard Bearak. We had 19 people on the session and we will be revisiting some of the basics that we need to know. We have under our wings so to speak as we go forward. We'll do one on zoning in January in early December, we are having city planning come on and talk about demographics and population for immigrant improv I. Think it's been moved to December 12th have to check the calendar, will get it posted at least and then the following week or two we'll have them back again to talk about the zoning for M crown. So DCP is creeping along with that process so that we will have enough time to ruminate or what we should be asking them for. I see a number of telephone numbers when the call I hope these people will be willing to identify themselves. Who is it that is phone numbers ending with 94? Could you please give your name? You have to unmute yourself phone number ending in 9, 4,201 6, and then it ends in 9 4. no answer, okay. It is an open meeting, it's just nice to know who you're working with again. We have two phone attendees one beginning with three four: seven ending in five six hi everyone, it's Miss, Kenzie hi! Thank you. Okay, Catherine tavares writes in saying she's having a problem with her sound. You have to. You have to assign the session to a particular.
