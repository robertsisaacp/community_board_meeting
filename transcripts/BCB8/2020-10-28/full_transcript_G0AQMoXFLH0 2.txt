Hello hi: how are you okay, good? Well, I had a little trouble today. The graphics seem to be different Janet. This is Francis hi, I'm Janet and Francis. This is debbie hi, Debbie, how's everybody. How are you I'm good? Did anybody else see any differences, this time and logging in? Oh? I know you know what I'd be logging in so much. I do not know what no. I did not have no problem. Vlogging then, did you yeah? It looked real, weird things. Look strange. I've got different windows and then now the graphics look a little different. I do not know. I did not have a dip because I'd be on all day on different things anyway, so I did not have a problem. Well, I'm here now where's our cheer person. Well, it's just 6:15.. Yes, they're coming out alpha holes, I suppose so I got some dinner waiting for me. Another zoo. I got another zoo, oh god! This is my second for today, I'm I listen today. I got something waiting for me. Some cleanups, I'm putting some clothes away. I got stuff all over. My house seems like I'm busier now than before. That's true, can you believe it that, because you're in the house, yeah at home, yeah and everybody wants to do a zoom meeting, I have to go to a place. Hi elsa, hello. Why y' all good hi everyone greetings eating. It's been a long time, folks, yep yeah! You do not want to hear me. We hear you never let me come back out and back in again. Do we have an agenda for this evening. Agenda for this evening is to create the agendas for the rest of our evenings. What about the thing they sent out about the street one of naming items? Okay, let's give it a few more minutes, get a few more bodies in the zoom room. I did not get a new list from the board yet members, I see that we have a cba participant, I'm not sure anybody's, but when we last left I'm here, I'm sorry, I'm literally Julia you guys who are who's the list of members. I do not. I am on a different computer right now, but almost me if I did my typical redundancy and I saved it in five different places- give me about two minutes to try to locate the updated list. I know and when I send it out to you guys back in, I believe in the beginning of September, miss weatherspoon took off a few members. I'm just give me two minutes and I'll see if I can find it for you. Thank you no rush and also the code naming thing. I had a few follow- up options for the potential, but if you guys want to continue with the application tonight by all means, please do so. I did forward it out to the committee. You do have the information package that we had at the office. Julia your voice is real choppy. That's what I hear I do not know if anybody else it could be the internet connection. I do know that optimum has been having major connectivity issues, but unfortunately I do not have video on so there's no way for me to eliminate that choppiness. So I will just go back into the background. Then wow Julia, I found the roster. It's a little wait. Okay. This is good because it's got the new people, but there's certainly some people who dropped off these entertainments. Okay, there's no way for me to share my screen. Is there you have the ball now you should be able to share it and I believe the only change to your updated roster that was in September was the removal of Dr Turbo. Was he the only one that was in yeah? There's a few people who've rolled off for non- attendance? We also have our new board members. Who've joined John, Buckholtz, Horace Blenman, only things that pop out at me, okay, so everyone I've dropped into the chat, some of the main issues that we've fielded at the district office regarding Est concern, so everyone can look at them and the doctor would be chair and vice the committee I think whatever it was. I do not know how much of it will be discussed tonight, but just so you guys have for your record. If you want it, I can pop it into the chat. Thank you all right. Why do not we take some roll call and see where we stand? Where's my dadkins Mr Buckholtz Janet collins present. Thank you. Holly Fuchs Ed Genie, Chris, Glenman, Jordan, Francis, Langley yeah. Thank you, Robert Lapointe, Celeste, Stern mark certain. I know Mark's here, I'm here there you are. Thank you. Here's a weather spoon here, hey Robert, wither wax is here and Deborah. Young is here. We have six seven six children, I'm looking at the cva square. Do not confuse me! It's easy business, but it's probably fine, because snorkeling said at the St at the top. The agenda for Jeanette is really just to kind of set the agenda for what we're going to accomplish in the next couple months. We're not going to dispose of anything tonight, particularly one attack. First meeting back and two, we do not have a forum, but we will. I want to discuss this code naming just briefly. I want to discuss the proposal to invite a department of information and technology. We do know what that is to talk about the 5 g network and we want to talk about your pandemic complaints list which thank you for posting in the chat. Excuse me Bob yeah. Can everyone just mute their background noise? If you could just meet your phone? I'm sorry your volume great. So it's just me now perfect. So thank you. Everybody. I hope everybody had as nice as summer, as could have been had under the circumstances, very little travel very little positivity, but hopefully we all made something nice out of it. One of the plus points I think for us and CB8 was that we live in a very nice place to begin with, so it was nice to be able to get out and about and use our parks and use our streets in new and wonderful ways as we stayed home for the bulk of the summer. I know I did with two teenagers. It was interesting to try to keep them active mobile entertained and it was good to have the open streets nearby to go out and sachet every now and then up and down the avenues. No one here is a problem with this, but we did have an active chat over the summer on our list serve and once or twice I think things got a little heated and out of hand and the tone that was used by some of the participants in the email exchanges that little personal or ad hominem, perhaps unnecessarily so I we did not moderate it unduly or you know, ask people to step down publicly, but I just want us to all try to be a little more aware that we are a diverse community with diverse opinions on what matters to people who have equally valid claims to this community. So let's try to not attack each other on email exchanges. We lost a good member. I think largely because of that I do not want that to repeat itself, I mean either direction on either issue for any reason. So, let's all try to play nice together again. I do not think that anyone on this call right now is a problem liable to be a problem on that front, but they're saying so. Miss Weatherspoon and I spoke briefly the other day and I think we'd like to try to set for a November meeting, and I know because we meet so late in the month. Thanksgiving does intrude we'd like to try to schedule the oh, really sharing content. Thank you, Julia schedule the co- naming discussion for a November meeting. I do not get the sense, there's a ticking clock on that. So if the members could review that more closely for the next meeting, that would be great. We also would like to extend an invitation. Julia would like the board office to an extended invitation to the individual from DOITT to come and discuss the 5 g infrastructure. That's coming so thank you very much again a November date. I think the date that we're supposed to meet is 24th. That is probably the Tuesday before thanksgiving. So I do not know if we're going to do that, but we'll see what their schedule permits and the same thing with the street code name. If we can, if we can put a committee meeting together that day, maybe we'll send a straw poll around to the members and see who's available for resume, we will see all right any comments on either one of those topics. You know we want to dispose of our business, but nothing is urgent and I do not want to just have a meeting to have a meeting. So if we can schedule it for that time, I think that's a good use of the committee's time great. Why do not we turn to the est concerns? Then we'll go through these one by one quickly the great pause 2020 it says 200. I do not think we've gone back in time, but you know this is in some ways it's kind of like living in the roman empire toward the fall, but hopefully after November 3rd things will brighten up scooters. Electric bikes concern over the proliferation of them. Noise from them increased illegal traffic of them on sidewalks of endangered pedestrians repair shops with little to no regard for pedestrian safety, as they openly engage in repair on the street. So, back to front I mean repair shops were like any other business. They needed to use as much outdoor space as other regard for pedestrian safety should be a given. They should not engage in that same thing. These things belong on streets and not on sidewalks the noise from them. Some of these guys are silent, that's almost more deadly than the noisy ones, but the proliferation I mean, I think, there's a couple of things that go here. Yes, a lot more of us used scooters this summer, myself included. My very smart wife bought one online toward the beginning of things, so I could actually commute and go do my job without going on the subway, and that was a great boon, but I was a scooter for the first time this this summer it was a very eye- opening experience. A lot of people do not share the road well, including other speakers, delivery man, but again I've got people slack for trying to do business in this time, but this is something to watch for. I do not think they're going to. I do not think we're going to see fewer of them. So the proliferation is something to watch, but you know manage scooter, shares, yeah, Revel, right, wanton usage of people not licensed. This is why I have not yet driven a rebel. I do not feel competent to drive a rebel. You do not necessarily know how to properly utilize this food lack of helmet usage endangering left, but, subsequent to this complaint there has been at least three fatalities associated with rebels, and they now have a they revise their policies. So Helmet usage is not mandatory. They will shut the bike off if they find you if their algorithm finds you misusing it and they have increased their learning curve before you can use it, which are all to the good right. We do not want anyone putting themselves or anybody else in danger. Commercial karting do we know Julia when the new zones took place, have they yet for our district, just ancillary to that non- commercial parting right, regular, garbage pickup, I thought was spotty at best this summer or missed a couple of times whether it's recycling or garbage. I'm sorry, I was. I was struggling to figure out how to unmute myself, and I have no idea what part of the screen you guys are seeing now, because you know a little slow and uptake today, but the new karting regulations went into effect in December 2019., so we are subject to them. Yes, and, as I understand it, the with the zones- everyone in that zone gets picked up at a certain time and new complaints that have started coming in the last 30 days or so, or that there are certain vendors, certain commercial businesses that do not like who their carter is and therefore they are not utilizing the zoned carter out of respect for these businesses. I will not name them, but there is one in particular that is a habitual bad actor that has refused to get the private carder for their zone and those complaints are starting to rise again complaints by residents about the business. That is correct. The vendors that do not utilize the zoned carter are now relying on. You know sanitation to remove their garbage. If sanitation does not remove it, then you know the residents have to look at it. For an extended period of time, it's something that we're working with the garage on, but we do not. We have yet to figure out how to resolve it. It's why I did not update it in this document here, but just to let you guys know and also, if you guys notice this, please let us know the other businesses that are doing this. Well, I mean, I know you're reluctant to name names, but can you give street corners? There are a few businesses on Kingston Avenue that refuse to use the carton company for that zone. No surprise all right! Thank you. We'll try to come up with a creative solution for that, but I think it's really above our pay grade. Let's keep monitoring and keep the sanitation department abreast of whatever we find in the mornings left behind. So moving on to the next issue: curbside seating and their impact on deliveries, Street, cleaning and Vermin. I was just talking with a business vendor on Washington Avenue this evening. Before this meeting showing me his new seating array, it looks really quite pleasant, I'll be Frank. The wither waxes have not yet dined out. We've gotten taken, we've cooked a whole ton of food here, but we have not gone to a restaurant for reasons of our own personal preference, but it looked very nice and we were talking about what his plans were for the winter and when and if the snow comes, and he showed me the thought that has gone in to creating this really nice seating area. It's tremendous. They said it's an investment that I had to make, but it was made at a very bad time for the business right. It's a lot of money. I had to spend that I need to spend to stay in business, but did not necessarily have on hand to spend so, hopefully our restaurants and bars and their curbside seating will permit them to last and stay around for nicer times. However, that does not mean it's impact free right, so deliveries, they're, taking up parking spots, they're taking in floating zones they're not taking up bus stops and they're, not taking up fire hydrants street cleaning is probably my number one issue with this right now. Our streets they've rolled back alternate side already, so the sweepers are not moving through in any case, as often as they were forget commercial avenues, but garbage and debris is going to pile up, and it's not going to be the fault of the restaurant tour with the bar owner. It's just going to collect leaves it's just going to collect wind blown garbage, so I'm hoping that department of sanitation stays on the restaurants and helps them maintain their own spaces where they have taken curbside streets space. I do not want to go through this item by item. The bulletin points are self- explanatory, but anyone hold a comment. Yeah. I have a question. Okay, I do not know how to raise my hand. That's all right. I do not see it anyway, so miss Collins go right ahead. Oh okay, are not the restaurants, like homeowners responsible for 18 inches at into the curve? Well, the buildings are responsible for 18 inches into the curve, and it's between the landlord and the tenant as to how they allocate that okay. So then that's everything, then the city takes up, takes over 18 minutes out for 18 minutes, 18 inches beyond correct and I'm not sure how having a semi- permanent structure in the street that obviously exceeds 18 inches changes that I'm sure in the program that devised this somehow they've addressed it. But I have not seen the answer. I can't imagine it's we're leaving the building owner and the tenant of any responsibility to do that in fact, he's probably enhancing their responsibility to keep that patch clean Mr young yeah. This is not. I want to preface my statement by saying it's not a complaint. It's clearly a question. I've noticed two establishments that have extended out into the street, which is fine, but on both of them like there's one on the corner of, I want to say, Albany avenue and sterling place. I think it's like a bakery shop and they do not eat in and they extend it out into the street on Albany Avenue, but they have a section. That's like an outdoor seating space from Albany avenue almost to Hampton place. Similarly, on Kingston, Avenue and they've come before us a couple of times, and I know sometimes: we've had problems with them right on the corner of Lincoln and Kingston. They did a similar thing onto thinking place. They now have a readers for anybody who loves Rita's ice cream, there's one right on Lincoln off at Kingston Avenue, but they've extended their outdoor seating so far onto Lincoln place. So it's really I mean I do not know. If there's any requirements about how far you can extend and I'm again, it's not a complaint. I just was. It was just interesting to see it's so large and particularly the one on kingston on Albany avenue, which had was not an eat- in place. It's people going and get coffee and bagels there's no seating, but to extend it so far just made my eyebrows go up, so anyone has any thoughts about that or know whether there's a requirement about how far you could extend to start with. It was very similar to the SLA committee. Sidewalk cafe guidelines. You could only have it in front of your establishment right. So if you have a corner lot, you're lucky you've got the short side and the long side, but if you're a mid block spot, you are unlucky because you only had your little slice okay, so they have since relaxed that they've said that if you have a neighboring business that is not doing this and I'm not sure of the intricacies, you can steal some of their space and make your cafe your sidewalk if they larger than the storefront so again, very beneficial for the mid block businesses with maybe a you know, a 15:20 foot width. They can now go 25, 30., okay, I presume it's the same, no matter what you have so the corner lots maybe can go farther than their their footprint as well. So definitely look into that and see if we can find that answer. Yeah I'd be curious to know but again not a complaint. This is just observation, so we know when to spot people who are misbehaving right. If anyone would have a complaint, it would be the residents who live in particular on sterling place between Albany and Hampton place, because it takes up the whole sidewalk but anyway, okay. Thank you. Thank you. Debbie. You mean that the the they have their tables in front of the homeowner. It's not commercial on sterling between and I think it's Hampton and I think it looks like it might be. A private dwelling apartment, building small apartment building, but it's not a the business, does not face onto a sterling place. It's only on Albany Avenue, but it are. You is about the bakery on the corner of Albany and stuff, of course. Yes, oh yeah, they definitely do have. I believe they own that apartment building on the staff. Oh okay, that was actually the first place that they built their curbside seating. That was the first they extended around onto the almond side. Oh okay, see, I did not know they owned that apartment, but okay, fine! Thank you for the information I do not. I said I think I do not know: okay yeah they. Definitely they took advantage of the loophole of frontage space of the establishment. Yes, okay, I'm going to take a class in loophole. It's called law school yeah. I got ta, consult my daughter and get to law school. So the last two bullet points under this basically double parking right, whether it's delivery trucks or just cars. I see it all the time on Washington Avenue, we have lost metered parking space in one sense, but we've gained the street seats and what will probably shake itself out? Is the delivery companies will figure out how to do this without blocking the street for more than you know, 10 minutes at a time, but it's the double parkers that you know. Hopefully the police will take a bigger hand and shooting them away to keep the street free for movement all right, moving on down budget cuts for department of sanitation right. So we alluded to this earlier. I wish they had not rolled back alternate side as big a pain in the butt as it was. We were all home and moving our cars was not an issue. We were there. Why not? It gave me something to look forward to at 9:30 on a Monday morning. I get to move my car yay, but now the downside of the rollback is that yeah, the streets do seem dirtier, especially now with leaves, and people have been super aggressive about, moving back in we're on a block where it's 9:30 to 11 on thursdays and Fridays, and my god, if at 10, if it is not 10:15 or 10 minutes after 10, cars are already moving back in to get a spot on the side that was supposed to be clean until it clear until 11 and the sweeper has not even passed so guess what it does not get clean stay dirty. So if there's anything, we can do to talk with department of sanitation. About that you know I would not mind seeing alternate side return to its full force, not a big issue, because again those of us with cars, probably sitting at home, looking at them right now, so we can make it work, increasing open streets, continuing restaurants, open markets and open streets by closing vehicular traffic, even post cover whenever that will be so yeah. This has been a great success, smashing success in the weekends and vanderbilt, and I know, there's been several other blocks or series of blocks throughout the neighborhood and the district that have been closed during the school day during the evenings. What have you and they're all supposed to stay the open streets program which, in my immediate neck of the woods, is on underhill avenue they're supposed to close down? They think in November they're, not 100, sure and the open streets. Restaurants is going to stay open through thanksgiving on vanderbilt, but the programs are in place to reopen in the spring. So again, we should be aware of that locally. For me, these have been entirely volunteer. Driven people like me go out at 8 A.M and move a barricade from one point to another: that's not sustainable! It's a great way to meet your neighbors, but again once we're all up and going back somewhere for work, it's going to be tough to make happen and the scheduling that is open streets vanderbilt. The restaurants has been amazing, praise to give the kony for taking on that challenge, no surprise to those who give and making it work by organizing a fleet of volunteers, 30 40 people on a rotating schedule who man the open hours for vanderbilt avenues, open streets, restaurants on Friday nights, Saturdays and Sundays. But again that is not sustainable, so we may need to be professionalizing it when that opens up again in the spring. So we'll have plenty of opportunity to discuss that and what worked? What did not work? We might suggest, as we get last bullet point. I think this is the last in Julia or is there more below the equitable streetscape changes anyway, more equitable streetscape changes and vehicle owners feel like everything is happening to them to hurt them. You know that's how people feel that's how people feel, but equity is what it's all about, and my point has always been that I feel the equities have been very tilted toward vehicle owners, so pulling them back a little bit and sharing the equities. I still think it's a it's a good direction, we're moving it's a good vector, but I do not want to see the city where, for those who need a private vehicle, can't have it. I would not want to see that city, so I do not think we're there yet and I'm sorry if it feels like everything is happening to them, to hurt them to some people, but hopefully that's not truly the case anything further down on this any comments. Those are all the issues that we fielded, with the exception of the one that I just gave earlier tonight about the establishments that do not necessarily want to use their great so add to this for the for the November meeting put the street naming discussion. If you would, please know this, this is just I can share this document with the committee if you want, but this is just from my notes. I just wrote that in because I did not have a piece of paper, I think it's great. This is this is how I would take take the notes yeah. My alert just went off for the est meeting, so I guess I do not need to. I can dismiss that reminder on my phone, any other topics that we want to discuss at the next meeting. Ms Young I had I put two things in the chat and all of a sudden. I can't remember what the first one was, but the second one was to explore a left turn signal from on eastern Parkway from Eastern Parkway onto New, York Avenue. I do not know if there's a reason why we do not have one there. The other thing that I've noticed- and I do not know if other streets have noticed. I know what happens on my block sterling between Brooklyn and New York, but I also understand it's happening on sterling between New York and Nostrand, where cars have taken to parking overnight. On the hydrants I mean it's really. It's really become very serious know that I've called three one, but a couple of times they ask me about, for the license plates number and at two or three o'clock in the morning. I'm not going outside the kids license plates number, even though I did it once, but it's, but it's pervasive and you know it's not parking there for a hot minute or hour. It's like repeatedly, I know, come about nine to ten o'clock at night somebody's going to park there and that car is going to be there to through eight or nine o'clock in the morning. Well, I have not noticed that, but I I'm not up at that hour, so wow, I'm talking nine o'clock at night, I'm not up. Oh okay, but that's time I am. I am a little concerned and what happened over here on this block. We had a dumpster that was being set on fire and the fire department had come a couple of times and then whoever was doing the fires also kind of started it along the Hebron grounds, and so there was a period of time when the police department, the fire department, was here quite often, and they were here. Cars were on the high street. That's tragic, that's yeah! That should not be the case mark. Were you going to say something to that? Yes, Deborah I'll mention I'll mention that also to the 77 priests and hopefully that they can do some enforcement on that I'll. Ask them also just to specifically look at sterling that at their at those two blocks that you're referring last week to last week, I was coming up. This was the middle of the day and the police were kind of on. They were on my block down and they're saying gregory and I stopped and had a little chat with them and they said. Oh, you know. If we happen to see it, you know we would certainly ticket them or something right. So I walked away and I came back. I said: wait a minute: there's a car right there on the hydrant parked right there. You know that car stayed there with no ticket and the police were right there. So it's normally the traffic enforcement section of the police department that we give out the tickets, but I'll, let them know okay. Thank you. Mark roxy! Yes, wait! Let me just say I just wanted to add a block for your also added that Brooklyn between brook bergen between Brooklyn and New York is also having problems with parking on the hydrant. Yes, so you can take that back too yeah, I'm so I'm Brooklyn bergen between Brooklyn and New York. Okay, all right sounds good, yeah! Okay, oh go ahead! I'm sorry! Mark, then back to deb. Yes, okay, yes, Rob! There's a couple of things that I have in reference to the cotting. Can we get a map of the of the cottage that's going to be done for the for the Brooklyn area? That's one thing: at our public safety meeting: it was a concerned resident brought up the issue of the scooters on the on the sidewalk and they brought that up to the police department and on what, with the response to the police department, is that if a scooter is stationary on the sidewalk and they seen them moving and they're stationary, there will be able to give them a ticket, but they do not want to chase the scooter. And that's one thing that they're not willing to do is to chase the scooter and endanger pedestrians and other bike riders, so that that's the concern that we have from the police perspective. What else I have Easton parkway the project that we have going on for the eastern Parkway. I have a major concern with that, because, on the on the western section they completed their walk, do not walk renovation, that they have that they was going on, but on the east side they have not. We have rochester, we have Buffalo those areas over. There is extremely dangerous when they're, when they're pedestrians walking crossing eastern Parkway and for the cars turning. So those are an extreme dangerous situation that was supposed to resolve from last year, but it's still ongoing, and can we put that as a as a top agenda and are we able to send an email to whoever's overseeing it? I'm questioning the time span on this, because this has been going on for two years, because I remember I was complaining about this when my daughter was in high school and now she's getting ready to get to graduate college, and we still have that problem going on. I did send him an email, but I would prefer it for the ferment to come from the Community Board and oh and for them to give us a time span, because it's an unsafe situation and if we can put that as a priority on our list, because it is a commitment from the city to get that done and has not been completed as of yet. I think that's about it. From my perspective for now. Thank you guys, agree 100 mark. If you're, looking in the chat, you'll see Julia commented about the left turn from New York to northbound from Eastern Parkway Northbound on to New York, we've requested it. It was supposed to be part of this project. There were reasons- and I remember why it was not part of this project, and I can't recall them specifically, I'm sorry so we'll get on it. But your quest, your point about rochester and the other things that were definitely supposed to happen. I agree: let's have Michelle reach out to DOT for an update, which is exactly what Julio says in the chat. We'll do great, we'll get that we'll figure it out. Okay, any other comments, questions concerns we can add to our. I had one I had one more and I raised it during another meeting. I can't remember- and this is on the north side of Easton Parkway, and I hope I explain this this properly when you come to East of Washington Avenue or is it east of Clausen? I'm not sure there is no division between walkers and bicyclists okay and having been walking up and down trying to get some exercise during our pause. I've become quite conscious of it. I'm not that even where there is the separation that everybody follows the rules, but at least you see some efforts with walkers trying to walk where they're supposed to why bikers ride, where they're supposed to on the sidewalk, where there is no distinction between where you walk and where you ride the bike, bicyclists and people walking, are just all and it's a safety issue. So I do not know if we can have this similar kind of separation markings on the east on the north side of eastern parkway that we do on the west, because, when you're heading West, once you hit Washington Avenue, it's divided there's a little raised piece of concrete where people walk and there's signs on the ground. But it's not east on eastern Parkway on the northern side, you're exactly right, and the reason for that is the bike. Lane is supposed to be on the South Median on the CB9 media. So if you're walking on the CB9 side, you will see that Ray's strip to a certain point, not the whole way, huh yeah, I you may be right. I could not well. I can walk because I start walking from New York Avenue and I walk on the south side and then I walk down to Grand only Plaza on the south side, and then I come back on the north side. So I was conscious and I think when I first reported it, I talked about it on the south side and then somebody said well, that's not our area, but then so I started paying attention, so I'm looking at it on the north side. But this it's a similar thing. When you get to a certain point, it does not exist on the on the eastern end, you're right, bro. The reason for that is that there is not supposed to be a bike lane on the Northern Median East of Washington, some people you're on the same thing, which would be a good idea. Why do not we just say put down some paint? Walkers cyclists right? Why not right, because they're riding bikes on both sides, so it does not matter, you know, and people are walking on both sides, so it should be safety for all. Debra yes, Mark is that is that before the before the entrance to the subway or after the entrance to the subway on the are you talking about on the heading east on the north, I think I'm trying to think I mean this is going, I'm going east or you're going west towards going coming. Well, I'm, let me say going east on the north side of Eastern Parkway. I think it stops at Washington would agree with Avenue yeah. I think it stops there. Okay, we can bring this up to D.O.T and see what would be involved. I mean the median's a funny place because it's sort of Quasi Park, Quasi Street and there may be some jurisdictional elements to it, but we can certainly ask we. We've observed this. What would be some suggestible changes that would be easy and achievable like a stripe, yeah, okay, great thanks any other new business, yes Rob and everyone. I just. I just wanted to mention that tomorrow there will be a round table discussion, actually rod and I were invited to attend it's hosted by link by super pedestrian.
