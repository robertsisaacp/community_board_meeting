One here is a problem with this, but we did have an active chat over the summer on our list serve and once or twice Things got a little heated and out of hand and the tone that was used by some of the participants in the email exchanges that little personal or ad hominem, perhaps unnecessarily We did not moderate it unduly or you know, ask people to step down publicly, but I just want us to all try to be a little more aware that we are a diverse community with diverse opinions on what matters to people who have equally valid claims to this community.
So I do not know if we're going to do that, but we'll see what their schedule permits and the same thing with the street code.
You know we want to dispose of our business, but nothing is urgent Time, I think that's a good use of the committee's time, great.
Commercial karting do we know Julia when the new zones took place, have they yet for our district, just ancillary to that non-Commercial parting right, regular, garbage pickup , I thought was spotty at best this summer or missed a couple of times whether it's recycling or garbage.
Everyone in that zone gets picked up at a certain time and new complaints that have started coming in the last 30 days or so, or that there are certain vendors, certain commercial businesses that do not like who their carter is and therefore they are not utilizing.
Well, I, mean, I, know you're reluctant to name names, but can you give street corners?
So, moving on to the next issue: curbside seating and their impact on deliveries, Street, cleaning and Vermin.
Our streets, they've rolled back alternate side already, so the sweepers are not moving through in any case, as often as they were forget commercial avenues, but garbage and debris is going to pile up.
It's, just going to collect wind blown garbage, so I'm, hoping that department of sanitation stays on the restaurants and helps them maintain their own spaces where they have taken curbside streets, space.
I think it's like a bakery shop And they do not eat in and they extend it out into the street on Albany Avenue, but they have a section.
The delivery companies will figure out how to do this without blocking the street for more than you know, 10 minutes at a time.
About that you know I would not mind seeing alternate side return to its full force, not a big issue, because again those of us with cars, probably sitting at home, looking at them right now.
It's a great way to meet your neighbors, but again once we're all up and going back somewhere for work, it's going to be tough to make happen and the scheduling that is open streets, vanderbilt.
Yet And I'm, sorry, if it feels like everything, is happening to them, to hurt them to some people, but For the for the November meeting put the street naming discussion.
You know that car stayed there with no ticket and the police were right.
So I do not know if we can have this similar kind of separation markings on the east on the north side of eastern parkway that we do on the west, because, when you're heading West, once you hit Washington Avenue, it's divided It's not east on eastern Parkway, on the northern side, you're, exactly right, and the reason for that is the bike.
