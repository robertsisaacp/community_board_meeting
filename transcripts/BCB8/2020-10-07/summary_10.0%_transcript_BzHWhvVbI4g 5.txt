Everyone, may I ask, since we do not have the opportunity to see one another, that we unmask ourselves and since we're fairly civilized as much of an opportunity, as you have will be to unmute yourself, because there's a lot in this agenda, although it seems really simple, so I, just wanted to take the opportunity to welcome everyone to what is the October meeting of the youth and Education committee and that other people will be joining us, and this is the part of the the meeting where I introduce myself and welcome everybody to this meeting.
And, of course, it's everyone's personal opinion as to what will be best for their child, but one of the things that was very interesting is that if you elected for remote learning exclusively, you would not be able to elect back into classroom learning on a quarterly basis and as we're now seeing we're having hot spots, one zip code that is coming up, that's in community board.
One of the announcements that was being that had been made is that I will be taking a leave of absence for the Community Board through the, but given that I have unique knowledge and special relationships, I will be working manner with our committee, secretary, Marva, Henry and also with Nora Daniels, neither of whom are present right now and which, but I know, they'll be joining the meeting later and just you know just to talk about things.
No one was given any quiet, answers, and so I decided to call and actually and call the Community, Board and ask: Could they call and reach out to somebody, because it's ridiculous, you know you have seniors So I made the I made the call and then one of my co- workers, because I worked for the city Also.
That group is comprised of the president of all 32 community education councils, plus the members of the city- wide organizations, and they have A few alumni members and one of the things that you know we see that is somewhat chaotic, has been the school reopening process and it's uneven in districts.
If you're working in a community over a period of time, there's a continuum of families and children, and so people begin to have confidence in you and It makes life easier on meeting the needs of the school body, meaning the product which are the children and then there's also the politics, If they can remove the community involvement, then that's just what they've done That's kind of a an analogy, but in the long run, typically people come out losing when you have being taken over by a larger entity, meaning and particularly and historically undisturbed, communities as I would deem brownstone Brooklyn central Brooklyn.
So I'm just going to mention them so that you know where we should have input as parents and as community members right.
You know what is the attendance policy in the time of Covid-19 and the attendance power by the principles and The principals must share that with the school communities in the next month.
That's one of the reasons why there is a provision to have the cova testing, so it's quick and accessible, but- It also requires that a pre, a parent or guardian, be present, so that still does not address the parent, that's unable to go to school and those are things that need to be worked out and to may be made.
And I know when Michael Bloomberg had gotten blanket approval for mayoral control and as we went through mayoral control, and we saw that communities were not being included in the discussions about what happens around our schools.
Things will be like to see that are included right charter schools operate out of the par purview of the Board of education?
Excuse me, the Department of Education, but their so to speak, comes from the New York state regions and Success Academy They do not have to seek community or public input where something like that could not happen right, but something like that could not happen with public schools.
Nor I, keep putting on this on a long- term advocacy having more of those meetings in New York City, to make it more accessible for us to be able to give our input because it makes it onerous that you have to take time off from work and then incur the expenses to do.
How that money's being expanded, even if it's just to look at the spreadsheet and Also one of the things that's come up aside from the the whole decision making around outdoor learning was, as it was described to me by a cec president that they basically leapfrogged over the community to make the decisions happen and made it a multi- agency, response.
Do not have any notification or say about that, and those advocates that think that you know having a car in New. York City should not guarantee you parking right.
Anyway, so yeah, so mayoral control is going to be an issue also I'd love to give a shout out to the family and community engagement of the Department of education.
What's, going on in our own neighborhood One of the principals, came to a parent and wanted the community board to advocate on his behalf right regarding an after- school program and my response, because it was a quick text, was Department of education, mandates, all requirements, are, and the first thing I directed that parent to do is ask you, Know or ask you know: ask to take a look at the budget.
Just want to be very respectful of time, because I have some ask of the members assembled just in terms because I'm I am, as I said, will be going on lead.
Make sure that you take a regular look at the does page so that they know when they're going to be paneled for educational policy meetings as well as they can review.
So one I'm going to have a conversation with principal me and Marcel We are very good friends a couple of issues and it's particularly the her budgetary requirements for having the parent coordinator, because we might be able to shoot something in no promises, But, I thought and also to have Camille, which is the person in the district office.
