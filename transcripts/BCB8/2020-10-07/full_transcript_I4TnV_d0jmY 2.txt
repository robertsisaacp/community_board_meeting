Okay, yes, once I, if I can get that audio going I'll, hang up my phone and then I'll call her. Okay, all right we're going to get started. Okay, so, like I said, welcome everybody, okay, we're going to get started and we have we do not have. I do not have the minutes for the last minute, but I will have it the next time, so we can bring ourselves up to date with what's going on with that, but I can tell you that we, they were working on a couple of projects, capital projects, but they were put on whole, of course, because of you know what was going on so with that being said, they just started back to work on the projects that we had. You know ongoing. In the meantime, they would be we're working on the well. You know the conversation is done. We talked about that at John, Recreation center they've been using that and that's been well. I had no report of people, you know any incidents or anything going on, so it seemed like that is working out pretty well. We did have another project, that's supposed to be going on, where they're going to have the exercise and the bars and they're going to have some more activity things going on outside of sit down recreation center. That has not been started yet, but that will I guess it will resume very soon I'll get some up- to- date. Information on that I did get a copy of the budget for 20 21 for our projects that we are what we have here. We have the the basketball court. I think they're going to go back and it's almost completely done, but they're going to go back, but brown park, basketball, court they're going to go back and repaint the support, the pay mid part for the basketball court. So they have to go back and finish that up they had a budget of seven hundred thousand dollars for that and six hundred thousand of that came from Carnegie and a hundred thousand of that came from the borough president. Okay, so they were upgrading the basketball court. You know they had a lot of cracks in it and they had to you know the the loops, the hoops and all the stuff they wanted to update so they're working on that now the Lincoln Terrace Park on conference station. There was a four million dollar budget for that. Okay, we got two a million from Andre samuels I have to see, but I see him empress samuels and the mayor gave two million the constructions in new conference station is in the scope status. They did a bid, a re- bid, contract from 2018 design was completed in 2020 and the construction will be starting in the spring of 2021. Okay, so they're going to start working on that in 2021. So we got to look forward to that. I'm quite sure that we probably will get another visit, maybe from parks or so tell us to update on that. You know you know in the near future. Okay, so I think that is it with the projects. Let me see what else. Okay, all right, we had the reconstruction of the baller and all of that they did. They finished all of the completion in inside the building, so that was a 3.09 million dollar budget where they did the hvac system, the boiler, and they did a lot of painting. They did a lot of adjustment. You know like upgrading the central recreation center inside they anticipate. There was a few more things they had to complete and by the fall of this year they should be completed I'll, bring you more up to date. Once I find out more information about that, okay wanted to let you know that had a meeting on the 19th of September with the Ralph Lincoln Gardens is on Saint John near Wrath Avenue, it's a garden that actually our Robert Matthews started. You know years ago, and he got that together and they made a garden out of it. And you know eventually, over the years it got dilapidated and you know they needed some attention and just started. You know everything started growing wow, so they wanted to revamp that garden. Okay, so we had a meeting the people in the neighborhood and the last, the Brooklyn trust. Last election Trust Committee met they owned that property, so they met with us and some other stakeholders and people that was interested in upgrading the garden. They had a their first meeting on the 19th, so they what they wanted to do was just start brainstorming what they wanted to do with the park, how how they want to upgrade it, what kind of activities they're going to have there. So there was a lot of great ideas about you know about doing you know, upgrading the garden. I think the next meeting that we have, I want to invite them, or you know, to talk a little bit more about it. So we can. The committee can help brainstorm with this group to help you know upgrade this garden. They do have stuff in the garden now, but it's like you said these clean up. They have a lot of garbage a lot around and it needs to be updated. Some of this stuff needs to be removed, but they are still growing tomatoes and peppers and squash and stuff like that. So you know they still have it, but they want to bring it up to date and invite people into it. So it's not inviting looking right now, but I do have some pictures eventually next time I'll just forward the pictures to you guys, so you will see the condition of it, but they want us to work with them to help brainstorm. How to bring this park back this garden back, okay on October the 17th they're going to have a cleanup day. They want. You know some of the people in the neighborhood, the community board the parks. You know all of us have come and helped clean up the garden. Okay, there's a you know a lot of little things. I need to do so I'll. Give you more information. They did not send me the flyer. Yet I do not have a copy of the flyer. I will not be here. I will be out of town. I have a family issue emergency. I have to go next week. You know my sister's sick, so I need to go out I'll be going for about two weeks, but I would like for some of the people from the Parks Committee, to join the the cleanup day for that and I'll fold. The information to you guys and you know if you want to go, you you'll, have the information. Regina. Are you there yeah? Okay, now Regina is the head person for Saint John, the friends of Saint John, Recreation Center. She wants to tell you some activities. That's going to be coming up soon. Go ahead! Okay! Yes, this Saturday October 10th at 10 30. We will be hosting or it's my Park Day Cleanup Initiative, in conjunction with a couple of other friends of parks, volunteers from around Brooklyn, so we're looking for volunteers to help us. We have the rakes. We have the brooms and the necessary tools. That's needed to do the weeding, we'll be planting 300 bulbs supplied by the Parks Department, and we just hope this event is a successful one, and now we can have many more. The flyer will be posted on the Community Board website and all the members should receive a flyer as well. So I'm hoping to see some of you guys there Saturday morning it's at 10, 30, 10 30 between 10, 30 and 11., it's a two- hour event, yeah two- hour event and the children's playground. That's where we're going to start in the children's playground. So it's a lot of weeding to be done and some raking the most important we want to. I have 300 bulbs that need planting, so we want to be able to plant those bulbs. That day did you have supplies and rates and stuff like that? Did they give you they're going to give you? Yes, we have everything: okay, yeah, all right, so that's at 10, so you have a flyer. You can send to email it to me and I can send it forward to everybody. Yes, we you'll I'll, send the flyer over to you tomorrow. We're just finalizing it okay, but everyone will receive a flyer and it's this Saturday, this Saturday between 10 30 and 11, and we're going to go on to two o'clock, okay to two o'clock yeah. So everybody got that so you know try to come and support. If you can, you know we got to, you know, keep within the health. You know rules of distancing yourself not being too close of a crowd. That's what they were talking about with the gardens that the Rap Lincoln Garden, that they do not want everybody to come at one time, so you can pace it out and come maybe like an hour here and an hour. You know for an hour at least to rotate, so it wo not be so many people at one time, even though that's outside, and they do have a lot of things going on, they still want you to. You know, make sure you know stay within the distancing. You know and make where your mass, of course that's the most important part where your mask yes and Ppe's will be supplied. We do have gloves and we do have masks. Okay, if you ca not make it, you know we understand it because you know we know that certain people are not going to be able to. You know handle that right, yeah, but there will be other things that you're going to be planning. You know you know in the future, after maybe after all of this is over that we can all support, and you know, support you with and just Virginia anytime. You need something, let me know and I'll see if I can get more support. I know you have support with some other groups that are coming to help you also, but we're here also as community board. Eight we're here to support you. Yes, thank you so much Miss Andrews and I hope I see you on Saturday, I'm looking forward to seeing you, okay yeah. I can have to reschedule that I'm going to get my hair done and I have to reschedule I'll go later. Okay here for the beginning of the beginning of the the rape thing, because I'm going to get my hair done and get ready to go out, but that's all right, but I'll come I'll come for that hour, at least okay, I appreciate it. Any amount of time is appreciated. Okay, does I really do not have too much more to report right now? I you know every year they usually want the subcommittees to have some type of event, which we, I guess we can call this as one of our events at the it's my park day, but since we're going through this pandemic, it's I think we're going to just have to put everything on hold right now until we get a little better grip of what's going on, you know so people you know we can start brainstorming for something, maybe for a year ahead of time, but just think of things that we can do as a park committee that would be beneficial to to what we are advocating for. We always wanted the parks to be clean. We want the parks to be safe. We want to be able to have activities for the children, adults and seniors. So we think on that term we could always come up with something we were going to have a ergonomic event, but that got placed on whole. That might be something we might want to do where we invite people like the Khan, Edison and Brooklyn unit gas, and then tell you how to you know, do things safely and things that people talk about planting gardens and fresh vegetables, and you know those type of things have an event where you have. We were going to have it at Broward park where we have all of these vendors come or these people are coming from different parts of of being safe and healthy with the earth and this in the plants and the world come out, and you know to give provide information, you know. So we can. You know maybe pick it back on that idea and just move along with it for the for next year or you know, or the next year or a year and a half. So if people got ideas, please you can email me, you can tell me, you can call me and we can write it down and we can start brainstorming. Okay, yeah. We have any questions or comments or I actually hi. My name is Irisa Weatherspoon. Can you hear me hi? How are you how's everybody, okay, excellent, hi, good to see you actually my picture's, not up, because I'm kind of moving so I'm I was driving and now I'm walking, but I just wanted some everything sounds so exciting. I love what's happening with the St John's. My question is: are there any other parks in our community that you work with? We work at green Street on Green Street park over there on the underground underwood that one we have those two. We have. What other parks do we have? Oh, we have Lincoln Terrace, Park, okay, yeah, all right yeah. I did not know. I knew we had a few more, but I just was not sure you know. I really did not really check to see how many, but I was just wondering you know if we had any movement or activity in the other parts. Is there a need- or you know just to know if we're used to in touch, we use the people used to come a lot from the Green Street and on the underhill one, but they just kind of fell off the radar after they got the project done and then they just stopped so they used to have you know capitalist projects going in those clocks, but you know now, since their stuff has been done, they do not yeah anymore. I see those folks are the only concern with their one interest and then they fly out and go yes and we have this house, I'm just going to talk to the school. So this is, you know, there's quite a few, but the stars are doing some other stuff too. There's going to be some more of the upcoming capital projects with them also they're going to be working, but we just have to you know just hope that you know we keep everything not only that we advocating for the safety of the park. Oh and another. I think I need to remind you guys and let you guys know when we go back with the rink Ralph Lincoln. They want us to work with the public Safety okay committee to try to strategize make sure that the garden is going to be safe and then that the the parks park you know the garden is going to be healthy and inviting so eventually we're going to have a joint meeting with public safety for Community Board right. So you know look forward to that. Also all right awesome. I thank you and I'm glad to be here. Okay, all right, so anybody else any other announcement or comments. Okay, now, next month you know we never it's always our meaning always falls on election day. Okay, so I've been, you know, I've not been having meetings on the election day or either we can decide. We can have a meeting the following week or we can just just haul off until December. They say that we could have at least we have to have at least I think three or four meetings per year, which is already sufficient. If we do not need to have a meeting so with that being said, I think you'll be going to have our next meeting in December unless anybody have any other any other topic. They want to talk about before that. What do you think? That's fine with me? Okay, anybody else have any concerns. I guess that's fine. If you have not been having meetings in November, you know you know sometime. I have it like the following the following Tuesday: if we think we need it really need it, but since things are kind of really slow right now, it's not really much too much going on they're. Just starting to you know, work back on the projects and construction, so they're moving a little slow right now, so we really do not have. I do not think anything dire now if they sometimes things come up like when you have to do an action item, then I'll do an ad hoc meeting and we have to meet. We would have to meet if something like that would come up and we have to meet to make a decision. Then we could call the meeting in November. Okay, I'm just hoping moving forward that we become more active in terms of our parks, any and even including our streets, especially with these budget cuts right. We do not have to stop at the park. Someone's street may need cleaning or what have you. I just want us to be more proactive, moving forward into 2021 right. Well, they do have quite a few. It's my park days with the parks I've. You know gotten noticed by they're doing that. Let me tell you: Brian Parker was very active, but we I have to find out what happened with Broward park on friends of Broward park, my understanding that Robin is no longer there and they know nobody's taking the lead to do the broward park to be the next person to take over friends of Broward park. So that's how things happen. They start they're good and then things fall off and people do not take pick up the torch to keep it going. So we're going to have to reach out to some of the members that were members of the friends of Bravo Park Dorothy. I think you used to go to those meetings right, yeah, okay, right so is it? Is it still up? Was it still? I do not know. You know I've been quarantining since March, so I've been staying inside. So I have not. You know, met with anybody or have you seen robin lately? No, I have not seen her for a long time. Last time I spoke to her. She was in physical therapy upstate with her son. Oh okay, all right! Well, they are indeed they are not in need of a of a director or coordinator over there. I do not. I do not understand why the people that were in the group, no one stepped up, but they are in need of someone and as soon as they get someone I would not mind partnering with them. You know it could be a back and forth thing whenever we're doing something in these parts, because I was in broward today and it definitely needs a little sprucing up. Okay, so we're going to have to hello everybody all right, okay, kill me! So I'm going to see if I can find some of the names. That's connected to that and see if I can get in contact with anybody. You know to see. What's going on with anybody be able to take the you know the lead on that. You know right now, because they were very active. They were doing a whole bunch of stuff there and they had a lot of kids activity. They had the garden, you know the butterfly gone, they had a whole bunch of stuff going on and I hate to see that go down. You know, since robin may not be there right now, so we need to do a little research there ursa and see if we can find somebody okay. Well, I know Valerie Nero was on their boy, so everyone knows Valerie Nero. I heard you know her, but yes Valerie Nero. She was, she was a part of the Bravo Park Committee. Oh person knows about me here: bro right yeah, you know what I I'm not familiar with her face because I'm familiar with her name always come to the Crown Heights North Association meeting, so she would be her. Contact would be with Crown Heights Nora. Okay, so we can get her yeah and you know you mentioned I'm sure the face has not registered with the name. That's I'm not sure I could tell her. I could tell her because Valerie comes to me. She has been my nurse all these three months that I was sick. So when she comes here I'll tell her yeah, that's great and you got a nurse, and I know that a nurse thank you. I stopped walking totally. I stopped walking praise the Lord yeah. That's why I won that money yesterday, at the casino we do have somebody at for Lincoln Terrace, Mr, Brown Larry. I got to find out what's going on with him because he dropped on the radar too, because he was coming to the meetings and all of a sudden he stopped. So you know we need to it's very important that we have these people that connect to these parks, so we can keep up with what's going on. Sometimes they give us inside stories of you know there may be a little something going on that need to be addressed, crime going up or something like that. So we need to you know, get in contact with these people to see if they can help us. You know, give us some information. I do know Peter Crashes used to come to the meeting for Dean Street Playground, oh yeah, so I got ta see if he or somebody from his group can keep us up to date on what's going on with Dean Street. I do not know the connecting person with underhill, so I have to find out that the person who was who is in charge with that right now. I think that's a great idea so we'll reach out to this box and see if we have the friends of and see if we can, you know get this going. Okay, so yeah. I think that's about it. If we do not have a meeting next month, I want to wish everybody happy thanksgiving, yeah everybody please go out and vote, please it's important this year, everybody! Oh yes, oh god, you're telling me! Oh yes spread the word. It's very important that we broke this year and the census. Also it's very important for our neighborhood. We have a very low. You know responsibility, especially yes, okay, oh, it has a beautiful meat and I like this me dude. Let me know already booby at the room I'm going to meet him: okay, go to the living room; okay, oh that's the baby! Yes, oh my god, she's doing well, oh god, okay! So it's so good to see everybody like yeah! You know! If you know you have my contact information. If you need to say anything or you think we need to have a meeting I'll, be happy to call a hot meeting if we have anything important to talk about, but in the meantime I think this summer would be the next meeting for us for that time, and if I have information that I that I think you need to know, I will forward that I'll. Send you the information to keep you up to date with what's going on. Okay, do not forget to come out on Saturday to support Regina, starting at what you say: 10 30 or 11 o'clock, yeah 10 30 people could come out at 10 30 as well I'll, be there all right. Thank you all right and October over there I'll send the flyer. Once I get it: oh, okay, we're cleaning up the park, Saturday Miss Boy same time, Saturday yeah. I think I mentioned that yeah, but I know it's Saturday. You know where I go on Saturday morning. This is in the morning: oh okay! Yes, okay, guys! If you do not have anything else in here, an announcement or anything else going on. It was nice hearing and seeing you guys yeah, it was nice. Okay, I feel like the walton okay.
