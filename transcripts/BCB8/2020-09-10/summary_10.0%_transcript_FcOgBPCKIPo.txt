We also have darryl white from the new york state attorney general's office on and two additional board members kevin, farley and gail branson muhammad excellent, okay.
So my name is matthew kidd, as most of you already know, I'm with the new york city campaign, finance board, specifically with the voter engagement arm, That's, spearheaded by the new york city campaign finance board, and what we do is we more or less We, engage and inform new yorkers about elections and voting in new york city I was invited by community board eight just to go over a few things , most importantly registering to vote updates to election and voting laws that have just been passed recently and also mail-in voting, as well as a few other things that are also voting related during this time.
If you know someone who is 16 or 17 years old, they can pre-register to vote The board of elections, mails out post site locations as well as absentee ballots and absentee ballot applications to folks as well.
It: paper application or online The new york state legislature has just passed the law that also now requires certain state agencies to also automatically register people to vote as well.
The board of elections will send out ballots to folks who put in an absentee request, that's only because by that time they should already know who will be on the ballot on the state.
Seven days after the elections, with or without a postmark That was a very contentious issue that occurred during the last election as well, but the board of elections will count it if it is received in the seven days that came after the election, so by november, 10th For folks, who are a bit more curious about absent city voting, remember you can always You know, fill out an application.
You know who might not be able to take it in and with people's concerns around the mail The case where you know you do have folks who are in the hospital and cannot turn in a ballot Is they when we also tell them that they should also have the person write down on a piece of paper that the person who's turning in the ballot is a representative of that person and also have that person's the voter sign it as well, just to make sure everything is good?, I, guess, I'm concerned about those who want to vote and want to make sure that their voters can't counted but cannot get out and how we can be up helpful to the handicapped and elderly in the community with making sure that their ballot is in So. Maybe that's something that could be pushed a little further to get a answer for those in the community who want to be helpful.
Or is that going to be specific to our community districts and those that are voting nearby as far as I've heard, that is supposed to be a general poll site, and that's all that we've heard I do know that the folks at the working with the Brooklyn nets are working outside of that to make sure that they, you know, engage with voters in any kind of way possible If you want to clarify which way you would like for people to put in their questions, in which section that way, you're able to follow along the chat section, So, that's something she mentioned on the bottom of the absentee ballot application They can designate a proxy who will be authorized to turn in their ballot Okay when I voted in the primary I use the mailing ballot You repeat that to confirm that my mailing ballot was received, don't expect to so prior to them instituting a agency ballot tracking, system?
The big difference about the census and voting is you do not have to be a us citizen to complete your census and in fact the census is an exercise of counting every living person in the united states, regardless of their immigrant status Of course, we, you may remember from previous presentations that I made that the census there are two populations that are amongst the the most under counted number one are children under the age of five, so we think about our schools not having the appropriate resources It's, often because those children were not counted and the second most undercounted community is black men 18 to 29, and that includes african-american, afro-caribbean, afro-latino and african So, very important to just understand how critically important it is to count everyone in your household, regardless of their immigrant status, and this is unlike the election.
So when you put it in historical context, then I think that it starts to sort of like break down the barriers a bit, because a lot of people are You , know really concerned about us sharing information with other government agencies or courts, and we as census employees everyone from the enumerators up until the most senior person.
We would only receive 55 of that, because we would only receive the resources based on the count and, of course, my understanding is expert I'm, not as I'm, not a professional in statistics, but you know they have people who are experts in statistics who will make some other You know assumptions about a community about attract about a city, but still I mean you want to be closest to 100 right, like we don't want any trial and error like people making assumptions about who lives where what the needs of the community are That's, how we end up with schools that are under resource senior centers that are under resource like the lack of hospital beds, which is a real issue and has been a real issue in Brooklyn right, particularly in central Brooklyn, especially and east Brooklyn I mean all of new york effectively, but all of that data is determined by census data That's the reason why they're getting the repeat visits from the enumerators, because they're still looking for people in those units they assumed like a lot of people, did because they filled out the form that they were done, and there was no reason why the innovators were returning I.
They tend to be black and brown communities, I'm working with lyft, who is one of my partners, lyft the car hold on one second You can see you can just hone in you can put in Brooklyn right and then from there My question was that so since april 1st, which is you know, the day-- that the census question is asking about, a lot of tenants have moved either just temporarily or permanently since then and I was wondering if landlords are under any sort of obligation to forward the census request to their former tenants who are no longer present in the unit, no they're, not no, that makes sense, but no they're not I mean, and they should regardle If. I mean technically they would have maybe put in a change of address, form or forwarding by usps and as well as in their new home if I move from apartment, you know like from I, don't know park place to zappos avenue like at you know one flatbush avenue that one flatbush avenue unit, whether it's a house or a apartment, every apartment in the united states, but if they get a mailer at their new place, are they able to respond on behalf of their previous home, where they actually were on april 1st, for example, if well, if they it's, where you live right, so I thought that people were supposed to answer based on where they are on april.
You lived before if you live in a totally different state like if you move from new york from Brooklyn to lebron when you're family, where you live now right, Theoretically, it's just so many people left temporarily and I want all that money to come here.
It was it was october 30th because of it would seem as though an extension would be warranted because of the current virus pandemic, the clover 19 pandemic We have any reports next on our full board meeting agenda and we'll try to take them in order, starting with the bylaws committee all right good evening.
Vanderbilt avenue, at least in our district, for open streets, restaurants- and this will sort of cast ahead to what mr ellis may be talking about in a few about mr saunders about economic development and the livelihood At the moment as to whether the esd committee is going to have a september meeting, we will let the board office know shortly.
Probably the second wednesday of the month and I hope that the new board members will consider coming out, because our committee will be dealing with the rights of tenants and that's a very important thing right now and I understand, I'm, not sure if the council person and the mayor were able to delay the lien sale.
The meeting for the land use committee in july was problematic, In the crown heights We asked them to come back in september and this project is called 959 sterling partners llc, and they are scheduled to come back in october and they have they asked to come back in october to land use and then to the full board meeting in august, the land use committee worked with the department of city planning to revisit for the third or fourth time the concept of public realm improvements for for the m crown, and so we will do that again in november and for the september meeting of land use, it was sort of a celebratory short session to point out that cb8 has done a landmark achievement of using a community benefits agreement to work with a developer to add aspects to its planned construction of a building in the proposed rezoning area.
They don't have the million and a half to do the environmental impact study that it would The back half of that statement is that they will entertain private rezoning applications So. they may The Applicants may be under the same kinds of financial pressures that everybody else is Nobody has money to be passing over to the next person Yes, there's no funding for the m crown rezoning, but we need to take this time to look at public realm improvements that we would want to happen there and I will be recirculating a nice powerpoint summary that was done by brian paul from the council's land use committee, with the help of chief of staff, tasha young for majority leader combo's office, and take a closer look at that I've done.
The next meeting is scheduled for wednesday october 2nd If anybody on the committee has any ideas of something that we can do to help make our meetings meaningful to the seniors, We did have one of the new community board members that participated in our last meeting Are there.
Let me start with daryl white from the ag's office I'm, just looking at the numbers of the people in the list that I got so I just want to say, hello, everybody community board a thank you all for being on the call tonight.
