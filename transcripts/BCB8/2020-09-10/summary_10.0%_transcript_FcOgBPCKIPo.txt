We also have Darryl white from the New York State Attorney General's office on and two additional board members Kevin Farley and Gail Branson Muhammad, Excellent So moving down the agenda, everyone's had a chance to look at the minutes.
Most of you already know, I'm with the New York City campaign, Finance Board, specifically with the voter engagement arm.
I was invited by Community Board, eight just to go over a few things, most importantly, registering to vote updates to election and voting laws that have just been passed recently and also mail- in voting as well as a few other things that are also voting related during this time.
You know, you have to be a U.S citizen to register to vote in New York state.
You could do the same thing as well, with the form there's roughly two ways you can register to vote in New York state.
The, New York state legislature has just passed the law that also now requires certain state agencies to also automatically register people to vote as well.
The board of elections will send out ballots to folks who put in an absentee request, that's only because by that time they should already know who will be on the ballot on the state.
I, should say, there's a new legislation that allows ballots to be counted in postmarked on or before election day, November third and received by the board of elections, seven days after the elections, with or without a postmark.
You know just make sure that you check the box for temporary illness on the application and starting Just to remind you all October 27th, is the deadline to request an absentee ballot by mail.
It came with and additionally, please make sure to sign the back of the envelope as instructed, and if you are going to send it back in the mail, please make sure you do it by November, 2nd I've heard mixed things about taking in the mallet mail- in ballots, for maybe the elderly, you know who might not be able to take it in and with people's concerns around the mail.
I, guess, I'm concerned about those who want to vote and want to make sure that their voters can't counted but can not get out and how we can be up helpful to the handicapped and elderly in the community with making sure that their ballot is in.
I do not know, I'm, not sure the state legislature has asked the Post office to come in for a hearing to explain some of the issues, The state legislature, as I mentioned, earlier, passed a provision to sort of relax that problem when it comes to posted postage, page envelopes, because that was the real issue like some folks It sort of like just became this huge issue that sort of spiraled out of control, so hopefully with the new laws passed by the state, legislature.
I do not know if you have much information about that, but is that going to be a general polling location or is that going to be specific to our community districts and those that are voting?
If you want to clarify which way you would like for people to put in their questions, in which section that way, you're able to follow along the chat, section.
I wanted to start with the numbers of where we are and just give you a snapshot of not only Brooklyn but New York, City, New, York, State and national.
We just had a presentation on voting, so the two most important things I think, as persons residing in the United States- can do right now our vote and do their census.
The big difference about the census and voting is you: Do not have to be a Us citizen to complete your census and in fact the census is an exercise of counting every living person in the United States, regardless of their immigrant status.
You may remember from previous presentations that I made that the census there are two populations that are amongst the the most under counted number one are children under the age of five, so we think about our schools not having the appropriate resources.
So I can also drop my email in the chat, but I personally know that I've requested a number of mobile census.
Vacant units should be counted as zero, so if they're just vacant, you know someone if it's like a private home And, you have like an empty apartment: Or you're, a landlord, and So. A great example of that are people who have second homes right.
If we were going to get a 100 million dollars a year, 100, let's say: Let's, make it bigger people from New, York, Love, money.
You know assumptions about a community about attract about a city, but still I mean you want to be closest to We do not want any trial and error like people making assumptions about who lives where what the needs of the community are.
That is something that they need to do so that those units do not affect impact our greater numbers and go unreported I know you work very closely with James Tillman, my colleague, so you can send it to myself or James, and then we can see if we can share that with national, But right now, we're in peak field, operations.
So we have any reports next on our full board meeting agenda and we'll try to take them in order, starting with the bylaws committee.
Another area, we're making some changes in elections, this one's very pertinent, because we're going to have elections coming this upcoming may of 2021 elections for the officers of the board.
If we can not meet in person right now, our bylaws require signed, paper, ballots and immediate runoffs, so we're putting an escape clause in the elections, provisions that permit the Nominating committee and the district manager to set alternative rules should they be called we're actually also bringing the elections provisions to the conformity of what we've done actually with my job.
On that note, officers making three minor tweaks we're clarifying the fact that the chair of the board is a non- voting, ex- officio member of all committees.
We need to render a decision right now or in the near term to help inform other stakeholders of what we, what the Community board thinks long- term policy.
Look forward to some very stimulating discussions and I hope that the new board members will consider coming out, because our committee will be dealing with the rights of tenants and that's a very important thing right.
We originally had them laid over to September They asked to come back in October to land use and then to the full board meeting in August.
The land Use Committee worked with the Department of City planning to revisit for the third or fourth time the concept of public realm improvements for for the M crown neighborhood rezoning, and so we will do that again in November and for the September meeting of land.
Just wanted to mention that miss ties and myself and maybe a few other members of the Community Board, will be meeting with the Ralph Lincoln Community Garden representative on September, the 19th.
Our next meeting will be done on Monday September, the 28th, that's Monday, September 28th it'll be at 6:00 6,30, but we'll verify the time we'll have the community board send out the invite to everyone to participate?
The next meeting will be on Monday September, the 28th, and that's I'm, going to be at 6:30, and the community board will send out the Invites Okay, I think we lost our incoming state.
Okay, so I just want to say, hello, everybody community board a thank you all for being on the call.
I'm, a public school teacher in Crown, Heights, right, now, and I'm still teaching through December, but as we get our office set up and everything and office infrastructure I'm set up, I still want to make sure that I'm available as a community resource and help anybody with what they need.
That is for the word, for not the number four contact at Jabari for state Senate, DOT com, any and all things that you need help with we'll do our best to put you with the appropriate resources, and if you get, I, want to get involved with the campaign.
'll be working on helping out with some upstate Senate campaigns in October to you, know, fight for a veto, proof majority in the New York State Senate.
I do not think that people understand the commitment that members of the Community board put in the time and the effort to ensure that our local government is run efficiently, and this has certainly always been one of those meetings that you enjoy coming to because it is run efficiently.
You know: New York state's rent laws has changed and the and the assertive things in the new rent Lord that you guys should know, and we have that on our website- A g, DOT, N, Y, DOT, gov, You, know enough time, I'm hoping that Gail will invite me to the senior committee meeting Thank you, so we'll make sure that link gets in one up on our website as well, and people can access it from there as well.
