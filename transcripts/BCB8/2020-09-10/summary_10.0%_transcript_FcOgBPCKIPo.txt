We also have darryl white from the new york state attorney general's office on and two additional board members kevin, farley and gail branson muhammad, excellent, okay, so we're up to 24 So moving down the agenda, everyone's had a chance to look at the minutes.
Yes, okay, all right, so my name is matthew kidd, as most of you already know, I'm with the new york city campaign, finance board, specifically with the voter engagement, arm.
I was invited by community board eight just to go over a few things, most importantly, registering to vote updates to election and voting laws that have just been passed recently and also mail-in voting, as well as a few other things that are also voting related during this time.
You know, you have to be a u.s citizen to register to vote in new york.
The new york state legislature has just passed the law that also now requires certain state agencies to also automatically register people to vote as well.
The board of elections will send out ballots to folks who put in an absentee request, that's only because by that time they should already know who will be on the ballot on the state.
You know just make sure that you check the box for temporary illness on the application and starting Just to remind you all October 27th, is the deadline to request an absentee ballot by mail.
Is they, when we also tell them that they should also have the person write down on a piece of paper that the person who's turning in the ballot is a representative of that person and also have that person's the voter sign it as well, just to make sure everything is good?, I, guess, I'm concerned about those who want to vote and want to make sure that their voters can't counted but cannot get out and how we can be up helpful to the handicapped and elderly in the community with making sure that their ballot is in.
I put it in the chat as well, but I had heard from some people that part of the that part of the issues with the primary election and that postmarking issue was some confusion about whether post offices needed to place whether they needed to postmark these ballots, because there were a lot of ballots that did indeed go through the post office in order to arrive at the destination, but they didn't have post, marks, and I think there might have been some confusion at the post office about what they were supposed to how they were supposed to handle.
I do not know, I'm, not sure the state legislature has asked the post office to come in for a hearing to explain some of the issues, The state legislature, as I mentioned earlier, passed a provision to sort of relax that problem when it comes to posted postage, page envelopes, because that was the real issue like some folks So it sort of, like just became this huge issue that sort of spiraled out of control.
If you want to clarify which way you would like for people to put in their questions, in which section that way, you're able to follow along the chat, section.
So much to michelle and community board 8 for inviting us I wanted to start with the numbers of where we are and just give you a snapshot of not only Brooklyn but new york, city, new york, state and national.
We just had a presentation on voting, so the two most important things I think, as persons residing in the united states, can do right now our vote and do their census.
The big difference about the census and voting is you do not have to be a us citizen to complete your census and in fact the census is an exercise of counting every living person in the united states, regardless of their immigrant status.
City, That may be one to like, let's say three family homes that are becoming 80 unit, buildings right , there's 40 people, online.
So if they're just vacant, you know someone if it's like a private home A great example of that are people who have second homes right.
You know assumptions about a community about attract about a city, but still I mean you want to be closest to 100 right, like we don't want any trial and error like people making assumptions about who lives where what the needs of the community are.
If well, if they it's, where you live right, so I thought that people were supposed to answer based on where they are on April 1st You lived before if you live in a totally different state like if you move from new york from Brooklyn to lebron when you're family, where you live now right, Theoretically, it's just so many people left temporarily, and I want all that money to come.
We have any reports next on our full board meeting agenda and we'll try to take them in order, starting with the bylaws committee, all right, good, evening.
If we cannot meet in person right now, our bylaws require signed, paper, ballots and immediate runoffs, so we're putting an escape clause in the elections, provisions that permit the nominating committee and the district manager to set alternative rules should they be called we're actually also bringing the elections.
We need to render a decision right now or in the near term to help inform other stakeholders of what we, what the community board thinks.
At the moment as to whether the esd committee is going to have a september meeting, we will let the board office know shortly.
Look forward to some very stimulating discussions and I hope that the new board members will consider coming out, because our committee will be dealing with the rights of tenants and that's a very important thing right.
We asked them to come back in september and this project is called 959 sterling partners, llc They asked to come back in October to land use and then to the full board meeting in august, the land use committee worked with the department of city planning to revisit for the third or fourth time the concept of public realm improvements for for the m crown.
So we will do that again in november and for the september meeting of land use , it was sort of a celebratory short session to point out that cb8 has done a landmark achievement of using a community benefits agreement to work with a developer, to add aspects to its planned construction of a building in the proposed rezoning.
But I just wanted to mention that miss ties and myself and maybe a few other members of the community board, will be meeting with the ralph lincoln community garden representative on september, Mr robert matthews is the one who originally started that guarding along with the community.
And, that's I'm, going to be at 6 30 and the community board will send out the invites- Okay, I think we lost our incoming state.
We did have one of the new community board members that participated in our last meeting.
So I just want to say, hello: everybody community board a thank My name is jabari brisport, I'm, the incoming state senator starting in January in senator 25, I'm, taking over after development.
I'm a public school teacher in crown heights right now, And I'm still teaching through december, but as we get our office set up and everything and office infrastructure I'm set up, I still want to make sure that I'm available as a community resource and help anybody with what they need.
'll, be working on helping out with some upstate senate campaigns in October to you, know, fight for a veto, proof majority in the new york state senate.
I, don't think that people understand the commitment that members of the community board put in the time and the effort to ensure that our local government is run efficiently, and this has certainly always been one of those meetings that you enjoy coming to because it is run efficiently.
New york state's rent laws has changed and You know enough.
Time, I'm hoping that gail will invite me to the senior committee meeting Thank you very much, mr white.
Miss zimmerman wants to remind us that today is request your ballot day for those who are planning to vote by mail.
