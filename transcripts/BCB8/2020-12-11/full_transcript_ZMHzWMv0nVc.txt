Okay, is it cold there in New York, I'm in Washington fighting the good fight, happy, Hanukkah, senator Schumer, hello and I. Don't know who put oh: this is a webex yeah we use zoom, usually zoom has less trouble than Webex I. Think. Is this your monthly meeting? Yes, this is our monthly meeting, I'm Michelle George the district manager. How are you thanks for joining us? Thank you. We've been planning this three months into working everybody's busy. Yes, when we're ready to start, I'm ready when you are I can stay here. Miss Tyler, you see our chair was on, but we couldn't get a video working so we're waiting for her to rejoin her. Okay, that's great a few minutes. I! Don't know why you do you usually do Cisco, because I don't know who did this on my staff, but zoom is much better says. Okay always have trouble with Well. Webex is the official city's platform. We've been gotcha, sure yeah. How many people are on the line here, because I only got about seven. Eight pictures, but I got a lot of boxes. 52, 42, very nice and they're still joining yeah good and you meet every Thursday every second Thursday of the month months, every second Thursday, and how long Michelle have you been the district manager? I've been district manager for 11 years wow. You don't look any worse for the wear. You look much younger than that. I. Look a lot younger than I am thank you very much. So does my wife and we've been married? 40 years, oh nice, my parents, listen to this. My parents have been married, they've had their 71st anniversary in April, they're, 97 and 92. My father was an exterminator. He struggled his whole life, in fact where he worked might have been. Yes, I think it was in. It was on Atlantic. Yes, his little exterminating place was on Atlantic by Near Washington, that is in your district. It's in community port, 8, nice anyway, he's a funny guy. He said I'm 97 how bad could ddt have been while we're waiting. I'll tell you one more story. This was my Thanksgiving story about my parents, who are 97 and 92, so we've had every thanksgiving with them. In fact, I was born on Thanksgiving day and every year it's been a very nice celebration in our family, but this year, of course, we couldn't get together because of Covid-19. So each of us gathered in our own homes. With our you know, greater families, but we thought and my parents couldn't come being 97 and 92 they were staying in their apartment. Anyway, we thought we'd do a very nice thing and we do a zoom with them or a webex at 6:00 p.m, and we get on there and my mother gets very angry. She said you lied to me, I said: well. What do you mean? We've lied to you mom. We came here to wish you happy Thanksgiving. She said you went you weren't all getting together, but I see you're all together and you haven't invited us. I said no mom. This is zoom. What's zoom I said, zoom allows everybody to get their pictures together and talk to you there's no such thing as zoom you're, making that up you're all together and forgetting me. It took us about 15 minutes to tell her that no, we were not together. We were all apart, but we wanted to all say hello to her together. That's funny! That's nice! Isn't that something yeah okay, she's rejoined us. Yes, thank you for coming senator. We appreciate it. We appreciate you coming in this part is successful. We don't have any crazies running around. In the background. We can't see you miss Tyler. My video is still not working seems like I would have to change the machines, I'm not sure. Oh, you were at the event we had at the armory I guess right they didn't. They were mad at her about something. So they tried to dis. They did disrupt our meeting. We're going to do that same meeting on zoom I. Think it's scheduled next week. Yes, I have the invitation. Thank you good. So should I start? What can we can everyone turn their cameras on that Miss ties. You can open the meeting and we'll press record and start great district manager. George keeps us in line. I can see that I asked her she's been district manager for 11 years and she doesn't look any worse for the where she looks much younger than someone who's been the district manager for 11 years. Well, this year is a trying time for all of us. Yes, it is, and I just want to make sure that everyone knows that we appreciate that we're all still here we are the lucky ones and as such, we need to plan for a brighter and safer future so to open this meeting. I just want to say that there is a light at the end of this tunnel and we have an effective and safe vaccine on the horizon by March of 2021. It should be widely available to us for free at our local city and state hospitals, including Kings, County, Downstate, Woodhull and Interfaith. If anything good has come from this trial, it's that it has shown us that we are not quitters. This community has hung together over the past year, using whatever means necessary to attend to the welfare of those less fortunate and to maintain focus on what is happening in the district and what might be coming down the pike. We are grateful for your continuing civic engagement and wish you a very happy and safe holidays and a safe and healthy new year. Thank you all for coming tonight with that, since we're not voting on anything, I'm going to turn this back to senator Schumer, to give us his updates and information on legislation and what he sees coming our way. Thank you for coming and I will try to talk for about 10 minutes and since we started a little later, I'll leave about 10:15 minutes for questions and I'll come back another time. I have another zoom that I have to do. That starts at about a quarter of 10 of seven okay. First, thank you all for serving on the community board, I've been a community person. My whole life I started as a tenant, organizer and so I know. Community boards well and I know that when things go right, no one says thank you. When things go wrong, you hear about it. So I want to say thank you for your service community Board 8 is Crown heights. I live nearby and I ride my bicycle through your board, all the time on Eastern, Parkway and all the way through. My parents live in Queens. In fact, I ride my bike down, he's all the way down to the end of Eastern Parkway and going to Queens to see them, but in any case and I'm a brooklynite total, so I know, you're, bored and I know that it's a ladder up that people are striving, people are working, people are middle class and trying to stay there. People are poor and trying to get there get to the middle class. So I know how important this board is to the future, not only of New York City but really of America and, of course, it's a board of so many immigrants, I believe in immigration reform. Very much. I'm the author of the comprehensive immigration reform bill and you know when I March down the Caribbean Day parade through your district I tell people I, asked people a question. I said: what's the biggest island in the caribbean and some people say Jamaica and some people say Barbados and some people say Cuba and I say no. It's Brooklyn. It was the biggest island in the Caribbean and so appreciate that, let me say a few things here. First, so thank you for your service. The fact that there are people like you gives me hope in the future of our city and our country, we're in the middle of a national crisis, as Ethel mentioned, the greatest economic crisis since the great depression, the greatest health crisis. In a hundred years since the spanish pandemic, flew over 290,000 families have an empty spot at the dinner table this season, because people passed away from Covid-19 people are losing their jobs. People can't feed their kids. People are getting evicted from their homes, all through no fault of their own. Because of this evil disease. Small businesses are having trouble, and so we really need relief and that's one challenge, and then we faced a second challenge this year. Our democracy was at risk, Donald Trump is a despot and he wanted to ruin our democracy and, even after he lost he's still playing these games and trying to say he didn't lose. He says: there's fraud when there was no fraud, but the good news is this. Most of the court cases that have been Trump has run have been thrown out even by republican judges in conservative states, and so the Good News is on Monday the 16th of December. The electoral college will declare Joe Biden to be the next president of the United States and all of Trump's shenanigans are over. So that is very good news. Now Covid-19 relief. This has been something I have worked so hard on. I was the author of the original Covid-19 build the cares built, which did a whole lot of good. It got 100 billion dollars to New York City I wrote the law that said, unemployment insurance should be augmented by 600 a week. It kept 12 million people out of poverty, I authored the paycheck protection program, which helped our small businesses and at first when it came out. If you were a small business and didn't have a fancy banker, you didn't get money, we changed it. We put aside money for small businesses and minority businesses, we put a lot of money into cdfi's, community development, financial institutions and Mdis Minority development institutions and here's I'm met with the leaders of some of the church and synagogue leaders and they said our congregations are going under because there's no services and no collection plate and I got them added to the Ppp program. So many of the churches, synagogues, mosques and other houses of worship in your community were able to get some of that money. As was small businesses. We got a. We got money for our hospitals, the hospitals Ethel mentioned at the beginning. Many of them would have gone under with not for the money. We got money for the MTA four billion dollars, so it should keep running and many other things, but here's the problem back in March when I passed. This I negotiated this with the Secretary of Treasury Mnuchin, and that's why New York did well. We got 10 billion for state and local governments too New York City got several billion. New York state government, okay, but we thought Covid-19 would last be gone by the summer. So most of the programs have expired and we need desperate relief. 12 million people will lose. Unemployment benefits are the day after Christmas. If we don't renew the bill, 12 million people, our business, small businesses, will keep going under our churches, we'll have, and our synagogues and mosques will still have these problems. The MTA will run out of money. So right now, as I speak to you, I'm in Washington I wish I were home tonight's, the first night of Hanukkah, which is Halibrae. Of course, I celebrate and I can't be with my family, but I have to be here to be fighting for New, York and fighting for people who need help and what's happened. Right now is Mitch Mcconnell who's. The leader of the Senate, is holding up all of this. He doesn't want to spend any money. There are 20 people in his republican caucus in the Senate who want to spend zero dollars, despite the fact that people can't feed their kids despite the fact that people are addicted from their homes. Despite the fact that businesses are going under and millions of losing their jobs, he doesn't want to spend a nickel he's this right-wing guy and the big corporation and big mobiles don't want to pay any taxes. So then, so we're fighting him as we speak, and hopefully we can get a bill next week. That does things we passed it in the house already the Heroes act and it had money for state and local governments and for the MTA and for schools to reopen safely. You can't have a school open if it's not going to be safe, more money for small businesses, non-profits our churches, as I mentioned money for restaurants, they're, going under no one's showing up money for our venues, our independent venues, money for food assistance for kids, more unemployment, insurance, etc. So this past the house but Mcconnell when you're the majority leader of the Senate, you can determine what bill goes on the floor of the Senate and he's stopping it. So we're putting a lot of pressure on him right now to get it done and there's a group four Republicans in the Senate broke with Mcconnell and they're trying to get it done and as we speak, we're negotiating and trying to get as much of this done as we can one of the things he wants to one of the things we're trying to get in the bill and working with Bernie Sanders is twelve hundred 1200 check to everybody like we did the first time out, and another thing we're trying to do is make sure that there's enough money, just what Ethel mentioned, to distribute the vaccine for free to everybody safely, so that by March or April, when everybody who wants the vaccine gets it, we should be a different place. So there's a whole lot to do there and I'm fighting very hard to get it done. It's I'm working with your Congress Members Yvette Clark is my congresswoman and I. Think she's much of yours or is Hakeem Jeffries, some of your district too well, whoever Yvette, Clark and Hakeem and I we're good buddies, we're working together. She event is my congressman because I don't leave I live right by Prospect Park, I'm not far away from you and that's why I know your district so well, if I get I'm trying to be majority leader, if we win the two seats in Georgia, I will be majority leader and all these good things I can put on the floor of the Senate instead of Mcconnell having the ability to block them because he's a majority leader now and most of them will pass and if a majority leader I just want to tell you we're trying to win in Georgia. We have two great candidates, us off and someone. You might be interested in Pastor Warnock because he's the pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church, but guess what he was a pastor in New York. He was the deputy pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist church. That's how I got to know him. I recruited him to run that's Calvin Butts church up in Harlem, but now he he's such a great man and a great preacher that they made him the head of, probably the most famous pope did in America the Ebenezer Baptist Church Mlk Martin, Luther King's old pulpit. But in any case, if I get to be a majority leader, there are three big topics: I want to cover. The first is income inequality, wealth inequality, making it easier for poor people to get into the middle class, making it easier for people in the middle class to stay. There's lots of pieces to that. There's a large infrastructure bill, a trillion dollars, 40 of the people who are hired by that 10 million people will be people who don't have jobs or don't have good paying jobs and they train them for construction jobs. Those are good paying jobs and we rebuild our infrastructure, and one of the things in that bill is every home should get Broadband. Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s said every home should get electricity because it was a necessity. Well now, broadband's a necessity, a lot of homes in community board; 8. Don't have broadband because they can't afford it, and then they can't the kids can't learn it's it. Just cuts you off from the world. So that's in our bill. We have a bill to take Elizabeth, Warren and I are trying to remove 50,000 of student debt from anyone in student and make community college for free that'll help people advance we're also in our bill is job training for good paying jobs. Money to communities, and another thing we want to do is called the Economic Justice Act, which should really benefit board eight. It takes the 300 billion dollars that trump and Mnuchin put into a slush fund and instead sends it to poor communities and communities of color to deal with the systemic racism. That's been part of our society and it goes for housing and it goes for jobs, and it goes for summer school. They have summer programs and after school and night centers I spent I went to James Madison High school I, don't know if anyone here went, but I spent my nights at the Knight center. It kept me off the streets playing basketball. Our team at Madison wasn't very good. Our motto was, we may be small, but we're slow, but it kept me off the streets get me off the streets, so all of this money, the Economic Justice Act, would go there and there are other things that you may not think are economic, but they are I. Am the leader in the Senate to try and create a path to citizenship for all immigrants, documented or undocumented? If they were freed on, when this passes to work to travel, it would unleash such economic energy. The gdp would grow by three and a half percent and we can get that done, and criminal justice reform. That's economic. If a young man has a record and then he can never get a good job again. What good is that, so we're pushing for all these things as part of that second, is democracy, making our democracy better, getting rid of citizens? United, a horrible decision that lets the wealthy put dark money into our politics. We would get rid of all the decisions that the Supreme Court made that get in the way of people voting. In fact, we put in automatic voter registration, you show up at the polls, you vote. That would be huge. 10 million people would vote. We put in DC statehood. Why shouldn't Washington D.C be a state, and then we get two more Democrats in there. So that's another thing we do, and the third thing we focus on is climate, but climate change to create good-paying jobs and climate change to affect the poor communities that have been most effective. So those are the things I want to do. They're part of something called the thrive agenda on the climate issue, which most of the progressive climate change groups are backing. If I get to be majority leader, we'll do all those things so I want to end. On a positive note, Ethel said we got tough times. This has been the roughest year in a very long time, but we're persisting and we're still here and you're still showing up at the board meetings and making your communities of brown heights and Weeksville and the other communities you represent so much better prospect heights. That gives us faith in the future and New York we've been put to put down before we had sandy. We had the big economic crisis we had 911 because we stuck together, we stayed unified, we didn't give up, we bounced back. We will again so with that. Thank you for listening. I'm sure I'm gonna try to do this once every you know. Six months show up again, so you can and I have a great staff. Steve, Barton and Julieta Lopez are on the phone and I'll give us a call and I will give Ethel and your their number the phone numbers, and you can call us for anything. You need federally to help you out with that Ethel is. It is effort running the show. Whoever is running the show I am the chair and we have at least one question for you. If you have a minute before you go, I do I have a time for three or four questions: okay, we're looking at problems with our local housing authority, funding for there's a movement afoot to prioritize it and we're dreadfully afraid. A lot of people will lose their homes. Nice communities to step up and pay those bills and bring those facilities back to habitability in our infrastructure bill. You see, infrastructures, roads and bridges in all tunnels, but it's also housing and schools, and he put a hundred billion dollars in to upgrade public housing. Nycha would get the biggest chunk of that. I am a big defender of public housing and I will push very hard to get that done if we get in the majority and if we get a bigger bill when Biden becomes president the bill I mentioned is a down payment, but if Biden cuts in we're going to try to do a much bigger bill that stimulates the economy creates more jobs, etcetera, not just to deal with emergency and one other thing. I'd say: Ethel in this bill is 100. I'm sorry Gary, I'm on zoom. What's going on? Okay in our in this bill in the Heroes act, we're trying to pass had a hundred billion dollars for rental assistance, that's not new housing and that's not construction, but for to keep people in their homes who are getting kicked out because they're losing their jobs and can't pay. The rent, so we have a moratorium, but a moratorium does no good if, after six months, you owe six months rent. So we need some help for people to pay the rent and that's in the bill too. Thank you. Are there other questions, district manager George that we can get on the floor before he has to go? There are a few raised hands: Miss Weatherspoon? Yes! Well we're going to start with the hands that are already raised in the chat room, so we have Kermani hi Kamani wherever you are I see you there you are I am sorry that I raised my hand for something prior, so you could go to the next question. Thank you for spending time with us. Thank you, Karmani. Thank you for doing the job on the board. Robert Callahan Mr Schumer. How are you hi I just wanted to know if you wanted to talk a little bit about what the wealth transfer? That's happened over the last 10 years since the last recession. Yes, whether you have any plans to talk about potentially a financial transactions tax at the national level, just something to the effect of just a one-time wealth transfer. In addition to a more progressive taxation policy. Okay, well, I totally agree with you that we need a much more progressive policy. A much more progressive policy, I would repeal first. The first thing we do is repeal all those trump tax cuts which went to the very rich, that's 1.7 trillion dollars and what we would do with that money is two things one. We would try to transfer money to poorer people and lower income people, as you said, and the second is we do use some of it for job creation and things like that very important, and so we're going to try to get both those things done in the Senate, as for other means such as you mentioned the tax on each transaction and things like that, those two would be on the table: we're going to figure out the best way capital gains, getting rid of carried interest loophole. All those things are on the tape. Great next up is Desmond Atkins, but the first job Robert get rid of those trump tax cuts. That's 1.7 trillion dollars that went to the wealthy that we could give to that. We can use to repeat poor people and middle-income people. Sorry go ahead, that's okay! So Mr Atkins! Yes, good evening! Senator Schumer! Can you hear me? Yes, okay! Thank you. My question I posted it in the chat and we had met several years ago at Robert Carnegie's state of the district, oh and I asked you I had asked you the same question. Then I attended a seminar at Nyu earlier in the spring, with one of the members of the board and the community Reinvestment Act was discussed and all the panelists who were truthful in private conversations and all the people there found that it's still an inadequate vehicle to help housing and redevelopment initiatives within the city and at the time I was under the Mis guided point that it was a quarter of a million per institution and since then I've learned that it varies per institution in the number of uses, but it is largely inadequate. It's a farce and I would look forward to you, bringing along with the other economic initiatives, to help the people of this community surrounding communities in all of New York City in their endeavors to try and get better and better housing. Yes, so the community reinvestment act. The economic reinvestment fact that I talked about is 350 billion dollars to poorer communities and commuters of color. It takes that big slush fund that Trump put together for the big corporations eliminates that and puts it into minority and poorer communities, part of it for housing, part of it for job training, part of it for infrastructure and part of it for youth and school programs for people, and it would be much better than Cra when Cra started. Mr Atkins, it was pretty good. I helped write. The law, I was in Congress back then, and it said when any bank merged they had to put money into the zip codes of the poorest communities. But when Phil Graham, a very conservative Republican got head of the banking committee, he basically defanged it. So it's on the books, but it's useless. We need a much stronger act. Now then, there are two more small initiatives of working towards the public banking initiative: that's already being brought forward in the house, aligning that in the Senate and also in the same 350 billion dollars that you've just earmarked or you're attempting to earmark getting training for inner-city youth to become workers and trade unions. 40 billion dollars is in the bill for that. We desperately need that in this community award, and the chair of this board has been championing that I'm not trying to steal her thunder, but I have your ear for the moment, but she will tell you more about it herself, this Mr Atkins, that, in addition to the infrastructure bill, the infrastructure builds a trillion dollars, but forty percent of the new jobs have to go to people who are not in the construction industry who are poor. People who got out of prison who will get a big increase and construction jobs are good, paying jobs, and you know it's a skill that everyone could learn. Thank you, Mr Atkins. We have a few more questions. Senator Schumer has to jump off so we're going to take a few more okay. Michelle how's hi, hello, senator Schumer. Ah there you are hi Sarah, I'm glad you mentioned doing tenant organizing in addition to the community board, I also volunteer as a tenant organizer with the Crown Heights Tenant Union and I just wanted to make sure that you were aware that evictions I mean people talked about a moratorium being in place here in New York, but it is not no longer in place and evictions have already started in Brooklyn yeah and it's honestly been horrific. It's terrible so far, I mean illegal addictions and then legal evictions are coming. I have started already as well, and tenants in New York are not able to pay back all of the rent that they owe, and so the housing justice for all coalition. A lot of people have been pushing for rent cancellation at the New York state level, but I would hope that our federal elected officials are also paying attention to this. Yes, and what we have done in this heroes act is put a 100 billion dollars to help people who are getting, who might be, who would have been evicted to pay their rents and I? Think that's a very important thing and that's the best thing we can do at the federal level and it's in our heroes bill now the Republicans are fighting it, but so far, we've gotten to do 25 billion for the next four months on an emergency basis, we'll see if they follow through. On that, we need to I, couldn't agree with you more. We need help here. Big help, yeah and I mean just to follow up there's. Also, a lot of us dependent activists are concerned that there's going to be. You know from this crisis, there's going to be a massive transfer of the ownership of properties to the largest real estate concerns in the entire state, because these properties are distressed. They can't afford to hold on to that yeah see. That's why giving money a moratorium is good, but the problem is some of the buildings are like three family buildings or four family buildings and the landlord's not rich, so giving the money to the tenant doesn't throw them out. You know, doesn't make them give up their buildings to other people. I mean you have a lot of those. In crown heights and in Prospect heights etc. So that's why giving real dollars is the best thing to do and I'm pushing that? Thank you so much we lost Michelle there you are okay would be Allison, Brundette, hi Allison! That's my daughter's name, where's Allison! Okay! We can move to Celine. What's your last name, she's here she's on mute, tell her she's on mute. Yes, please rosetta, hi, Celine, hello! Thank you for I, guess being on this call and hearing us all out. I'm an owner of a small barn restaurant located in Crown Heights, Cole, sweet Brooklyn bar on northern Avenue. We are limited to 25 right now inside, however, to service 25 of clientele requires for us to use a hundred percent of our fixed operating costs, such as insurance utilities, etc. Is there anything anywhere? Yes, somehow allowing us to get big on that we put in the Ppp the protection program for small businesses, a special provision for restaurants. You would get a six-month grant and by then six months, God willing will be recovering from Covid-19 with the vaccine to help pay all your expenses and it won't be limited to 25. It can go all the way up. The National Restaurant Association and the New York Restaurant Association are strongly behind us and if we get this bill, passed, I think there's a good chance. It's going to be in there it's in there right now, I'm fighting to keep it in, and the guy that guy on television he's involved too Kalikio yeah he's involved in this too. When he's supporting what we're doing so in the meantime, I guess we all thought in March. This would be over in six months, all right. It are there any stipulations where we would get court for at least a year. Yes, it goes retroactive, I think to August first, okay, Michelle! Thank you Ursa! Thank you! Everybody! Thank you! So much I. Thank you again for being on the board. If you have other questions and concerns your chair and your board manager will have where to reach my folks and we'll do everything we can to help your communities in CBA. As I said, it's a ladder up, it's the future. Thank you for joining thanks. Everybody. Sorry very much! Thank you. Take care, Merry, Christmas, Happy, Hanukkah, Happy, Kwanzaa to everybody. We need everyone to lower their hands because we still have some hands raised, but I think the questions were already asked. Okay, so the meeting's been called to order now to take care of some business.

On behalf of state Senator, Zellner Myrie, just bringing his regards and greeting, for you know the holidays and the new year. Of course, 2020 was a tough year for our communities, but you know there's still a lot of work ahead for our community. So in terms of that, the session for the state legislature will be starting on January 6 and there's a lot of work to do for our community and the Senator. One of the main focus will be. You know, housing and eviction. So, as you guys may know, the senator has a strong eviction moratorium bill that pretty much stipulates that any eviction like there will be no eviction for a year until the pandemic is over. So we really gonna push forward and like make sure that bill gets past next session to provide much needed relief for our tenants, but also for our small businesses that are hurting. We just had a small business town Hall a few minutes ago that we had a few strong businesses that are making ways to recover, but you know also finding ways to stay in our community that they have service and served for. So many years so that will be like the gist of like our work for this session. In terms of our district updates. Our office is currently closed as we are moving to a second wave. So if any constituents or any tenants or have any questions they can reach out to our office via our phone number or our email, our phone number is seven one, eight, two, eight four, seven, zero repeat again: seven one, eight two, eight four: seven zero and our email is marry.

Let me pull up the action items, so the Slack committee met Monday December 7th at to buy a Webex virtual meeting platform. The committee discussed a couple following liquor: license applications a renewal for James restaurant at 605. Carlton is seeking to renew their full license at the meeting that at this time of this application, a quorum was not present for this item, but the committee discussed approving the application and hopes that the full board votes in support of renewing this liquor license.

Oh okay, I said yes, I was thinking and the motion passes with 30 3 in favor great. Thank you. Mr Weatherwax. If I might take this moment, miss Tyus just for a couple short announcements that I think are pertinent. First of all, just as a reminder, our food and beverage outlets throughout New, York City, are suffering a very major plight these days with a lot of limitations on their business activities. As you heard from one of our own very own members, our own community members, Ms Rosado from sweet Brooklyn on Northern Avenue. It's very difficult and I think I just want to make a couple announcements, just to kind of increase our awareness and share that there are a couple options right now that we can do if you're, having or see issues with operations of a business regarding Covid-19 standards or social distancing or outside setups. There is a program with the city that is offering called NYC mend M-e-n-d. It is a way to work with the business as opposed to going straight to regulatory and enforcement agencies that might cause undue damage to the businesses operating. Obviously, I'm not suggesting this if this is a major public violation, a public health violation, but certainly, if you're a neighbor to an establishment that you might be having some issues with I strongly encourage you to look at this program and to work with the operator directly as opposed to trying to bring enforcement down on them needlessly during this kind of difficult times again. I preemptively say that if it's not a public health issue or a violation or crime issue, the second thing is we're all in the holiday season and if it's within your means or your wherewithal to do so, I would strongly suggest you select a couple of locations in our community board district and look at that as an option for gifting a gift certificate, a future dinner out a small shop, even not necessarily a restaurant, but really try to look at our small businesses along our corridors. Nostra and Vanderbilt Utica, Franklin, Underhill, Flatbush, there's plenty of businesses within our district that we can be supporting during this holiday season and I would really just try to implore upon my community members and my colleagues here on the board and any community members that are visiting us tonight, virtually to really consider this as a gifting option, this holiday season. So thank you for the indulgence of this comp. This message that I'm sharing with you and I appreciate your time. Thank you. Mr Ellis, you're, bringing your expertise to bear on a problem like this is very helpful. I would hope that the ability of these small businesses to hand out a gift certificate is easy for them to do. Some of the larger credit card providers are offering membership services similar to what you described. So that is a very good idea. So we're going to move on to the next committee report and I will ask Miss Daniel to the resolutions for the land. Use Committee one at a time we're all together, one at a time. The application lpc2100136 for certificate of appropriate fitness to legalize facade, work and installation of mailbox in non-compliance with certificate of no effect 16-7468 for 875 St, Marks Avenue in the Crown Heights North historic district. Whereas Guy Cohen of Cone Architecture made a second presentation of plans and photos describing the project which is mainly to correct illegal work done by the prior owner and whereas Mr Cohen updated. The committee by explaining that compared to his presentation of November 2020 staff of the Landmarks Preservation Commission had recommended cures for the previously cited violations, including moving the mailboxes closer to the sidewalk, and that the only violation remaining was a replication of the decorative detail and fenestration of the turret facade, including the fish scale, design and finish of the window surrounds and replacing the stained glass window. And whereas Mr Cone again described the project as a hardship case. That indicated that part of the cost-saving approach is to use stucco to replace the fish scale detail removed by the prior owner. And whereas the committee members again voiced concerns regarding saying undesirable precedence by supporting supplementation from owners requesting forgiveness for out of character, work done in violation of LPC permit and, whereas basically sorry go ahead and whereas based on the revised scope of the project work as presented and on condition that the additional violations previously listed have been resolved at LPC staff level committee member Lisa Lizzer moves the committee to support the revised scope of work for legalizing, inappropriate, facade work for the second time as young and whereas 17 committee members voted to support the revised project as presented with none against, and one abstention, therefore be it resolved that the committee recommends. Support for the above, described, application for certificate of appropriateness for correcting work done in violation of Lpc's permit and recommends that the full board do the same. Thank you, Ms Daniel. Are there any questions on this resolution to support legalization of the work done at 875 St Marks Avenue in the Crown Heights North historic district? I'm not seeing anything in the chat, any comments, questions seeing none is for Motion James Ellis. I'm prepared to make a motion to support the committee's recommendation. Thank you. Is there a second Mr Witherwax? Will you please call the roll to support a 75 St marks who seconded that promotion? Oh, who I did Deborah Young. Thank you all right. 875, seven Yo Mr Kearmony Allison! Yes, thank you! Linda Andrews! Yes, thank you! Desmond Atkins! Yes, thank you! Lisa Atkinson! Yes, thank Wayne Bailey! Yes thank suspense! Yes, thank you! John Buckholtz. Yes, then Robert Callahan! Yes, thank you! Hanji Charles for Daniel! Thank you! James Ellis! Yes, thank you! Kevin Farley! Yes, thank you. Andrea Ferris! Thank you. Fred Frazier drew Gabriel. Yes, thank you. Tamika Gibbs! Yes, thank you! Johnny Granville! Yes, thank you. Genie Harris Blendman! Yes, thank you! Marva Henry! Yes, thank you! Jersey Jordan! Yes, thank you. Sarah Lazar, Murray Lemain! Yes, thank you. Elaine Mahoney, Elvis Picklesteins! Yes, thank you Robert! Yes, thank you! Yaya Raji! Yes, thank you Adam sacks! Yes, thank you. Brian Saunders, yes, Staten parishes should help yes, Mr sax. Please close your microphone. Thank you. Give him a comment. Yes, thank you. Willis Kimberly Watson, here's a weather spoon, yes, I, get Miss Mahoney I didn't catch your vote. Yes, thank you. Then. The motion was unanimous and supported by 33 individuals. Thank you. Mr Witherwax I want to point out to all the members in the audience that we have explicating report for Miss Daniels with a blow by blow on what was done in the land use committee. For these items, which are summarized we have two more to go: Ms Daniels. Would you please proceed with 97 St marks? Yes, application for a certificate of appropriateness to install a rooftop, stair bulkhead at 97, St, Marks Avenue in the Prospect Heights historic district, whereas Brian Ripple of confined architecture and interiors presented owner's plans for rooftop terrace and access to the proposed terrace requires a bulkhead opening in line with the existing staircase and whereas the proposed safety rail will be aluminum with glass, balusters and the surface of the proposed roof. Terrace will be porcelain, pavers and whereas the visibility of the proposed bulkhead was described as minimal from Saint Mark's Avenue, an assertion that could not be confirmed by a committee member, because a recent windstorm had blown down the mock-up and there was concerned voice regarding the color and position of the bulkhead, but the concern was not pursued and whereas Mr Ripple indicated the project is scheduled for a hearing before LPC in January 2021 Mr Verconi moves the committee to support the proposal with a second by Ms, Weatherspoon and 17 members voted 17 committee members voted to support. The motion with two abstentions. Therefore, be it resolved that the committee recommends, support for the above, described application or certificate of appropriateness for construction of a rooftop bulkhead and recommends that the full board do the same. Thank you, miss Daniel are there any questions on this item is Titus. Yes, I wanted to say that, as the discussion that we just heard reflected, it was not possible to see the mock-up prior to this item coming before the land use Committee. Since that time the mock-up has been restored and a couple of our the Phndc Landmarks committee members have gone to look at the mock-ups and not feel that it is minimally visible from Saint Mark's avenue. We believe either or those members believe the visibility was greater than the 18 inches claimed by the architect in his presentation. So I just wanted to advise the board that will likely be testifying to LPC that the size of that bulkhead should either be reduced, perhaps something other than a door be considered like a hatch or that it'd be relocated, someplace, where it won't be visible. The car that is visible that part should be finished to match the light gray of the mansard roofing, we're going to the bulkhead is made larger by a mechanical shed behind it that contains four condensers that are stacked on top of each other. Those condensers be located not stacked on top of each other and not inside of a mechanical closet. So it doesn't add this little bulk to the bulkhead. If you will and then finally we're going to ask that the glass rail be replaced by a cable rail or an iron railing painted Black, I'm sorry that these commas weren't available for the land use committee meeting. We had gotten really short notice of this application and, as I said, that the mock-ups were not available to look at before the land, Use Committee meeting. Thank you for the update, Mr Viconi and the assiduousness that you and your neighbors apply to maintaining the quality in the character of the Prospect Heights historic district. So now we know when we have a missing element to a presentation. We should be mindful of that and condition any votes we take on satisfying that condition as the time goes by with this new information available. I'm asking for questions or motion on this item which has morphed from when we saw it in committee. Are there any questions from committee members on this, seeing that I asked for a motion on this changed condition from a community board? Member I have a question: I guess: Mr Atkins I was just asking Mr Verconi in his opinion, did the change. After they, after what he had seen, make it so that they would not, it would not be acceptable to the board to the Prospect heights and to LPC any one of those entities. Well, I can't LPC and I can't speak on behalf of the whole community board, but, as I said, phndc will be testifying that we would like to see the bulkhead either reduced in size or moved, and so it won't be visible from Saint Mark's again we felt that and I was not one of the people who want to look at it, but two people did they both felt that it was much more visible than described by the architect, certainly more than the 18 inches that was described by the architect. So it does not get a passing grade. It sounds like we have two conditions or three conditions on which Phndc would couch any continuing support for this application am I, correct, Mr Peconi we actually have four one. Is that the one is that the size be reduced? The second is that it be painted in a way that will, if any part of it remains visible from the street. That it be less that it be painted light gray, so it won't attract as much attention and then the other two one had to do with reworking the mechanical closet, and so it doesn't add to the bulk of the bulkhead. If the bulkhead remains and then the last was the glass rail in the back with the cable rail, because there was some concern raised, that glass rail will be reflective, will reflect light and be distracting from back in the building. I. Don't know that I would be comfortable having the community moving. The community board take all of those positions because they weren't raised at the land use committee meeting, but perhaps I would move that the community board conditioned its support on the being reduced so as not to be visible from Saint Mark's Avenue. Is that your motion as a motion yeah? Yes, it is thank you Mr Vakoni! Is there a second in support of the motion that Mr Fakoni has made for acceptance for support of the rooftop edition at 97 St Marks Avenue? Is there a second for Mr Buccone's? Thank you and you are call this mickelsteins okay. So we have a motion on the floor. Any questions on the motion on the floor, Matt and chair a question that may morph into a friendly amendment disclosing my role as the current, but outgoing chair of phn DC I have no part in the deliberations of the Landmarks Committee of Phndc, though I think that this board Mr Fakoni, is too modest. This board can and should import wholesale I think Phnbc's determinations for the four amendments to the motion of support, because we rely all the time on organizations like Phdc and China to do the groundwork on this and there's nothing wrong about something that wasn't available at the committee meeting. That came up after the fact for us to include it in our deliberations here at the full board meeting. So I would have proposed a friendly amendment to bring in all four of those conditions. I agree with you wholeheartedly. Mr, Witherwax and I would encourage representatives from our various neighborhood associations to speak up as Mr Bocconi has done and not to hold back, because you guys are the boots on the ground and the eyes on what's going on around here. So if you don't speak up, we don't know, and whoever did go out from prospect heights to put some eyes on what was being done. Please let them know we're grateful for their monitoring of what's happening out there, so Mr Viconi. Do you accept the friendly amendments from Mr Bush, I'm happy to accept the Trump Mr Witherwax amendment. You want me to restate the conditions for support absolutely and then, as we go forward. Please put it in the chat, so we have that go ahead, please, first, that the size of the bulkhead be reduced or relocated or the ball could be relocated. It's not visible from Saint Mark's Avenue, second, that if the bulkhead remains the mechanical shed, be I'm sorry, the second that, if the bulkhead, if any part of it, is visible from Saint Mark's Avenue that part be painted a light gray to match the roofing at the Mansur. So it's less attractive from the street. Third, that the mechanical closet be removed from the bulkhead that the condensers not be stacked, not to increase the bulk of the bulkhead and for that the rail, the glass rail be replaced with either a cable rail or an iron rail painted black so as not to be reflective and add to the distraction in the back of the building. Thank you Mr Coney. So we will now recap on your explicated motion. We have a motion from Mississippi. We have a second from who now we have the second one Mr Nicholson. Thank you, okay, Draconians, and are there any residual questions on this amended motion? All right, I have a question: go ahead, I think it's more of a I guess just a comment so I just googled that the location for 97 marks just trying to visualize what all of this will look like so for future. You know, I think it would just be helpful if maybe there was just a mock-up or a blueprint. So folks can know what this will look in the future, because I'm just trying to visualize it. You know if it makes sense- and you know, in order to support yeah if it's possible, Ms Tyus, if you'd like to let me share my screen. I can show a picture that we took this morning that one of our committee members took this morning of the building at 97 St marks. We usually don't revisit committee work, but in this one instance, I will work with you on it. Go ahead quickly. I need I, don't know. If I can do that without somebody giving me some access to do it one second, I'm on it. So now generally Mr Allison. We do share this information that goes out to the committees. I have to check with Mr George. How broadly do we share this across the board of Ms George? The materials that come to land use is that shared across the board? No just the committee members get it okay, Mr Balcony, you should be okay, got it. Let yeah get there one! Second, okay, so this is the building, and you can see I mean this is clearly more than 18 inches of the top of this that's visible. This was taken from across the street. This is 97 state parks here, and this is the bulkhead. So if this was to be painted black, as the applicants proposed I mean, it would clearly be, you know, be very visible against the sky across this Mr Viconi. If I'm wrong, the building that is 97 St marks is actually the one. That's oh you're right. It's this one angle, this one yeah! Let me see it's already a super tall building. Yes, it is it's a five-story building. Let me go back hang on one. Second, let me see if I can pick up an additional picture for us. One second bear with me a second: are you finding this helpful Mr Allison? Yes, thank you so much one second, and let me just give me one minute: these are some additional photos. I'm only going to focus on the ones from so these are some pictures walking down the street on St marks. You can see it here anyway. I think you get the idea. Yes, thank you very much. We don't normally do this, possibly in the future. We can ask Miss George or Ms Neil to make the information the photos and plans available to the full board before we go into a full board meeting, so that those full board members who are concerned about items coming in from land use committee can take a look at them before we go into a full board meeting. So now you can do that. Madam, chair, yes hi! This is James I just wanted to share as a member of that committee that was present that evening. For this conversation, what Mr Viconia is showing us is, as a photograph was not at all shown to us in the same manner. At the committee meeting it wasn't enough. It's been calmed down. It happened if I may finish, please before you give me grief the packet that was shared with us had images that was taken of that mock-up and we could see them from certain angles, but not of other angles, but with the images that Mr Verconi are showing us are much more larger in scale and scope than what was presented at the committee meeting. I just want to share somebody who was actively a part of that conversation and actively a part of the movement of supporting that application. That now seeing this information, my opinion may change. Okay, I'm not even going to go into that, because the presentation was that the mock-up had been blown down, so it wasn't available right. The presentation mentioned that it had been blown down from that day, but the images that he showed us were still images from the street with the mock-up present right. That's, but it was a lot of them were obscured because of trees. That that's true I think that the images depicted the mock-up in a light that was more favorable than what we saw when we went to look at it actually in position, and that happens sometimes with presentations right. The architects sometimes try to present their project in the best light, but in this case we thought it was really different than the way he represented it, a false light, hidden behind a fully leafed tree. Okay, let's proceed. We have a recap on the revised the motion from Mr Fakoni. We have a second from Mr Mickelstein. We don't do. We have any more questions on it. No so I would ask Mr Witherwax to call the role on the motion to support with the four conditions. I will do that. Cameron hi! Yes, kermani, yes, to support. Thank you, Mr Allison, Glenda Andrews! Yes, thank you! Desmond Atkins hi! Thank you! Lisa Atkinson! Yes, thank you assistant. Yes, thank you holds. Thank you, Robert Callahan Abstain. Thank you for Daniel. Yes, thank you Andrea! Yes, thank you. Fred Frazier drew Gabriel. Yes, thank you. Timmy Gibbs! Yes, thank you. Did you Johnny Granville? Yes, thank you. Eugenie Harris-Blennan! Yes, thank you! Marva Henry! Yes, thank you. Sir Dima Jordan! Yes, thank you. Sarah Lazar, Marie Lauren. Can you say anytime? Yes, thank you. Elaine Mahoney! Yes, Calvis Mickelsteins! Yes, thank you! Robert Puka Yayaraji! Yes, thank you Adam sacks! Yes, thank you! Brian Saunders! Yes, thank you Paul! Yes, thank you mark certain. Thank you. Greg Todd Ethel Thomas. Yes, thank you. Yes, you Eve's villains, there's a weather spoon. Yes, thank you. Robert wither wax. Yes, the motion passes 31 in favor. With one abstention is you need to have a voice activation? Okay, so the next one is Daniel is 294, Albany I think that's a pretty short item application, lpc19 for a certificate of appropriateness to legalize the door in small terrace and rear facade for 294 Albany avenue in the Crown Heights North historic district. This item was tabled because of the lack of information about the project as Alexander Latovsky of Cityscape design. The principal representative did not make the presentation and there appeared to be a lack of notice to the name. The committee voted 16 in favor. With one abstention to table the hearing the applicant was invited to present in January 2021 you're still muted again. Thank you. I'm sorry I tried to keep from wrestling papers with open microphone, so that item was tabled and we don't need to take a vote on it. What I did learn after land use was that they that presenter Cityscape design had filed with department of buildings in June, so for some reason, he's not tuned in to what the process is for that, but they have been invited back for January. They wanted to come back this month and we had to explain to them that we don't meet twice as a committee during any particular month. So moving on with our agenda, we have other committee reports and I think the next committee up for presentation is economic, Development, Mr, Saunders, hello, good evening. Everyone I'd like to report. As we know, every economic development is very important at this time and we're actually in an unpardoned territory every second Tuesday of the month. We have a meeting at 6:15 p.m. We're actually looking for more members, please reach out to the community board and submit your name if you're interested. So the last meeting we talked about implementing a community engagement, walk or tour, where we're gonna basically go down the corridors of from Vanderbilt, Washington, Nostrand Franklin and just basically sell information and help merchants in this type of need, and I'm seeing what information we can provide to them and also support the different businesses on those avenues. Also, we have an upcoming presentation being done again by popular bank. That's just gonna be done next month and hopefully presented and I'm looking forward to having people come aboard members come aboard and hope to support and just forward I just like to say thank you for everyone have a great holiday and that's it second Tuesday of the month. Please excuse me, miss tires hello, yes, Miss Weatherspoon. What's that it was a question that was overlooked from Kathy Iceland, okay for economic development, it was at land use, so I just wanted to get that question out this island. Do you want to well? It may be a mute question. Thank you for recognizing me. It may be a mute question now that the board has voted. I was just wondering if, as part of this, the applicant is there a land use meeting between now and their LPC hearing, where the applicant would be asked to re-present, given the findings that Mpha was I mean that Phndc made available today, which were very informative. So is there a process by which they have to come back to the land use Committee or it just goes straight to LPC. Now, with the board's recommendation, I just was asking a procedural question. Thank you. Oh okay, let me ask which application are you referring to I? Pardon me 97 St marks, 97 Saint marks is going to go straight to LPC, and the letter that goes from the community board to LPC will reflect this evening's deliberations and this evening's vote. Thank you, okay. So that's how that works. The committee has to come back to the full board, for ratification has to come to the full board period for ratification before it goes to LPC. So that's the standard ops. We generally ask for applicants that don't get committee support and don't get full board support to come back to committee, so we can try to fix whatever whatever's wrong with the proposal and make it happen. If I guess, that's I, guess that was my question but they're Lp they already have an LPC hearing scheduled. Okay LPC works very closely with us and it may be a time lag, but you will see, for instance, the 294 Albany was on the schedule. They were pulled when they got at the community board. 8 report in draft and a formal letterhead statement will follow. They told it from the report. They, the LPC, keeps a close watch on what the committee the community boards are recommending to it. We're the boots on the ground. We've got eyes on the prize and they trust us to give them good advice on what's what should be supported by them and approved by them. Thank you. You're welcome we're going to move on to the next committee report, which is youth and education and youth and I believe that's Ms Mahoney, I'm health, youth, Education and Youth Ms George who's handling that either Miss Henry or Ms Daniel. I'm sorry, yes, Ms Daniel is Henry. You want to make a report now sure the youth and Education Committee met on December 1st. We came up with a survey that we'd like to distribute to teachers, particularly about how they can better serve their students. There was some discussion about whether or not virtual school is being successful for all students, especially given the fact that there are non-traditional caregivers at home, who may not either have access to the digital devices or know how to use digital devices and need you know, assistance with helping the students in those ways and also concern was expressed about whether or not the kids were sent home with paper materials, books, work, packets and things like that, so that, if they don't have the digital devices, whether or not they'd be able to do it. So our suggestion is to- and we came up with questions to put in a survey that we will hopefully distribute to teachers about what they need. What you know issues they see as far as engagement with their students and their families at home and what resources they could use to make the virtual learning process smoother. How can the full board help I think it's going to be an issue of distributing the survey getting if anyone knows of teachers that could distribute, amongst other teachers within their schools, within the district reaching out to Cec, 16 and 17. Seeing if they'd be on board to distribute the survey to through their networks, Marva it's Ken, I'm on the education committee, but I wasn't able to join this month, because I wasn't feeling well but I. Can't if you guys email me, the survey because I work for the DOE, so I can just send it out. I have at least six schools and I can have my team of social workers in Brooklyn I can find out who's in the 15 16 and 17 schools and I can send it out or if I, just get the name of the principals for 15, 16 and 17, which I can spend some time looking at I can just send it out. It's no problem. Okay! Thank you! So I'll put my personal email in the chat Marva and then, if you send me the survey and I'm so sorry I missed that meeting, because this is like all the stuff we're working on now. I can make sure that survey gets out. So quite a few people right. Thank you. I am so impressed at how well this board works together, fantastic anything else. We need to know check the calendar for our next meeting. I believe it'll be in January. Thank you very much question. Go ahead: hello, Miss Henry! How many responses are you looking to gain for the survey as many as we can get? Okay, I, don't think we've set any limits: yeah! Okay, thank you. I think Ms Neil was integral in collecting the suggested questions for the survey, so once we get it finalized, we'll definitely be able to send it out to everyone, and we would be appreciate anyone who can use their resources to disseminate the survey to the public. Thank you and miss Watson I see your email in the chat. Thank you for that report. If there's nothing else, we'll move on to environment, sanitation and Transportation Committee report, I'm going to thank you, miss Tess. I'm going to cede my own time to myself for the bylaws committee, because we need to action on the bylaws tonight yeah I had, but on the list. I was just stepping through the list. I have printed in front of me, but if you want to do my words now, please go ahead well before our membership drifts away off to the pre-pre-holiday festivities before I have any more eggnog right. Everybody specifically the committee members, miss Weatherburn, Miss, Weatherspoon, Mr, Thurton, Miss, Tyus myself, and if I forgot any Miss George. Of course, if we forgot anybody who joined in on our merry deliberations all summer, we once again reopened the whole bylaws and heard about how they work and how they don't work and came up with several ways to improve the concept. So I'm going to walk us through for the last time. Third time in a row, the five categories and the 15 or so changes that we're proposing and then I'm going to ask for a motion. I would prefer that motion to be let's support the bylaws Committee's recommendations as a whole, because that is the cleanest and neatest way to do this. But, of course let the chips fall where they make. So the bylaws updates category number one membership. We included default language for leaves of absence from board service. If you want to take some time off, there's now a mechanism in the biologist to do that, we were added notice requirements for excuses from given meetings. If you let us know in advance of the meeting, you will be excused from that meeting, you won't be counted absent. We shorted the shortened the notice requirement for removal proceedings from 30 days to 21 days so again we're on cycle. With our board meetings, we made some changes to the election procedure, we're proposing an escape clause in the event that we can not meet in person come time to vote. That would permit the nominating committee and the manager to set alternative rules for besides paper ballots, and we are proposing that there is no need to elect officers to fill vacancies under certain circumstances. The chair can appoint and the officers of the board the other officers of the board can approve the filling of that vacancy. We propose some changes to the composition, description of the officers we've made the chair very clearly the chair of the board, a non-voting member of all committees. We have established an emeritus category whereby a retiring board, chair of more than two of two or more terms, will have the title emeritus for the next board year and we put more specific definitions of the duties in for the vice chairs, the secretary and the sergeant again, bringing the bylaws and alignment to how we actually operate category four of five is our committees. We added a mechanism for choosing vice chairs. The vice chairs of each committee will be chosen by the board chair in consultation with the committee chair. Currently, it's just the board chairs decision changed some language about how frequently the committees must meet. We said at least four times in a given board year before it's a really, which is a little confusing, and we reorganized because it was getting too much now. It is only elected officers of the board and the chairs of the committees we've removed vice chairs, from service on the executive committee and then three or four miscellaneous changes. We have put some language in where the district manager has personnel authority. We have added some changes to the friends of Community board. Eight bylaws that incorporate all of these terms into those bylaws by reference, and we have clarified the different definitions of board term. A term is a member's two years or an officer's two-year term of office and the board year a year starts on September 1st and ends on August 31st. Now certain matters in the bylaws are keyed to terms in certain matters to years, and there was some confusion there, so you have all received. That's the high level view you've all received both of the current bylaws and the proposed amended bylaws as a black line and as a red line and I hope. When all is said and done, these are all acceptable treaties that will help our business community coordinate more smoothly. Mr Witherwax. Are there any questions from board members on this? Is our third go around on reviewing the pretending changes to the bylaws and I hope that we'll be able to vote on the revisions in January? That's the plan, correct Mr with wax. No, it will be voting tonight. We, but we read them through in October. We read them through November. We vote in December, okay, then. So now we're looking at any questions to the proposed revisions. The documents were circulated earlier. Are there any questions from committee from board? Members is Weatherspoon, am I missing anything in the chat? There's nothing in the chat, there's, nothing anything! Okay! All right, then I would ask that we have a motion put on the floor for acceptance of the proposed revisions to the bylaws. I would like to thank the committee for its work. Changes to the bylaws were excellent and I would like to move that the board adopt them. Thank you. Mr Peconi I need a second on your motion. Okay and I'm going to add a column to the vote. Roster I can't see who that was. Oh who's. Second to motion I had Robert Callahan Second in the motion. Okay, thank you all right. So we'll call the role on the revised bylaws being formally amended. All right. Thank you. Miss Tyus I will now call starting with Mr Kiermany Allison Support. Thank you. It's hard to be the lead-off hitter I know Andrews. Yes, thank you. Mr Davkins, yes, Lisa Atkinson! Thank you. Wayne Bailey Princess Ben James, John Buckholz, Robert Callahan. Yes, thank you, Andrey Charles, Laura Daniel. Yes, thank you. James Ellis, Kevin Farley! Yes, thank you. Andre Ferris drew Gabriel. Yes, thank you, Tamika Gibbs! Yes, thank you new Johnny Granville. Yes, thank you. Bye, Genie, Harris Blendman! Yes, thank you, Marva Henry! No! Thank you! President Jordan! Yes, thank you. Murray Lemaine, Elaine Mahoney! Yes, thank you! Elvis Mickelsteins! Yes, thank you! Robert Yayaraji! Yes, thank you! Adam sax! Yes, thank you. Brian Saunders! Thank you! Audrey Tate Hall! Yes, thank you mark certain. Thank you apple Tyus. Thank you from Tony. Yes, thank you. Here's a weather spoon! Yes, thank you. Robert wither wax! Yes, Deborah Young! Yes, thank you. The motion passes 25 in favor. One opposed one abstention. Reply laws shall go into effect as of now. Thank you all very much and putting on my other hat for the chair of the Esd committee. We will not be meeting in December. We look forward to reuniting again in 2021. Is that for January most likely, but not definitely take that as a maybe okay we're going to move on to the next committee, which is the health committee and I believe that's dismantled, have a report from the health Committee. Thank you chairwoman. So we had our first kind of kickoff meeting of the health committee reboot last month and our next meeting will be on December 17th. We set priorities for the next year and decided that we're going to have kind of a dual focus over the next 12 months, splitting between mental health and economic health. So this coming week on the 17th, we're going to have a speaker come from thrive, NYC to the meeting and give a presentation on the free mental health services being offered through the first ladies office and we're also going to be partnering with local food pantries to distribute flyers on thrive, NYC, and we would love to see you guys at the next meeting as we continue to kind of hone our prioritization going forward for the reboot. Thank you. Ms Mahoney I want to ask health and the other committees to try to make sure you have your agenda in your meeting, notices that get posted on the board calendar that I find that very attractive to potential attendees and I. Think we'll get larger audiences if we put the agenda out on the calendar. Thank you so much for all you do Mrs Mahoney appreciate it. Thank you, chairwoman. You too! Next up, we have the housing committee. Can you hear me? I can hear you now: okay, good last night, our discussion centered on the blueprint that was supposedly announced publicly in July that somehow we just heard about- and this blueprint is to privatize NYCHA, to put to create a trust made up of the housing units, and it would be a bond issue that would be financed by if I understood it correctly. It would have something to do with them being able to use section 8 in order to do this. The whole prospect is very scary because the residents will have very little say as to how things are done or what the priorities would be. The whole move to have private developers handle housing to me is very scary. It means that their right to remain in this housing would be based on the private developers and on market concerns and market conditions, and a lot of what New, York City housing should be attending to at this time. As far as repairs are concerned, this whole business of them, privatizing it and possibly having developers and a trust, take care of everything would mean that now there will be no incentive to make any repairs. The hearing that was held Tuesday I, did not have a chance to prepare remarks in time. For that there was a hearing with the city council about this. It was also a hearing with the state and it's my understanding that the end of the comment period is Monday, December, 28th and that would be to NYCHA. So we discussed last night having something prepared in response to that. We understand that housing authority residents were present and they are somewhat mystified because they got the notice at the last minute and they're not exactly sure what it means. The scary thing is that, once they convert these units to a trust, there will be no way to undo the process. We're talking about a city that has a homeless problem now and I'm not sure what the numbers are. But I can only imagine how horrible it would be if all these people in nature ended up losing the housing that they have and those people who are very concerned about welfare hotels, imagine stepping out your door and every time you step out you step over somebody who used to have a home I can't imagine it so I think that, even though we may not live in public housing ourselves, all of us have a stake in making sure that this does not happen. So, basically, that's my report. Thank you. Ms Granville, I, believe the hearings are available on the city council website and link to YouTube from the City Council website, or you can go to YouTube and search for city Council hearings. So those of you who want to track this and respond and send in statements should work on that. I personally will be doing that and getting back to district manager, George and working with Ms Granville to make a formal statement on behalf of the full board. Is there anything else we need to know on this Ms Granville? Do it yourself a mute yourself? Okay, can you hear me now? Yes, go ahead, okay, other than your suggestion that we make sure that not only the city officials, state, the city, elected officials, get the remarks, but the state elected officials as well, and possibly also the federal ones. I'm thinking about the remark that was just made when Mr Schumer was talking about the fact that some of the monies for infrastructure would include housing. So that's a very encouraging development to know that he's thinking of housing, his infrastructure. So as far as I'm concerned, that means that any urgency that there's no need to rush this, but what our discussion from our discussion last night we might have 90 days we might and we're not sure, because you have state budget here in the city and I'm very concerned whenever this city comes up with stuff in July. The boards do not meet and then you want to rush things through by the end of the year. You have what a one day public comment period one day and maybe let's go like we did so it's to me, you're, pushing it down people's throats and they really don't really know what you're doing or how it's going to affect them. So it's like a sneak attack as far as I'm concerned in the middle of it. This is what they come up with I'd like to make a statement when it's appropriate Mrs Tyus. Please go ahead. Yes, I after last night's hearing, I had some time to do some research, because I knew that we're trying to put together a statement on behalf of the housing committee. Perhaps the entire board I want to say at the front. I've not had a ton of time to do a full review of the blueprint for change. That's being referenced. I can say with certainty that this blueprint for change has had a deeply flawed public relations campaign. I think that the NYCHA should be how to say reprimanded for how they're rolling this program out. It's pretty tremendously badly done, but with that said, there were a few pieces that had been put out that I think it's worth correcting the record on the most important of which is that there's a very strong difference between what the city is engaging in here and what is being done already as far as privatization of work and the blueprint for change is not going to have any private development in the strictest sense of the word. There's going to be no selling of buildings. In fact, the blueprint for change explicitly says that the trust will not be allowed to sell the buildings. In addition to that, the work and the work that will be done on the buildings will continue to be done by NYCHA employees, so there will be no outside contractors that are conducting the work with. That said, there is still a lot of cause for concern and need for review of this program and I I'd like to have some time to review. What advocates are saying, because, quite honestly, this is not a new process. This process of creating trusts that are run by the city has been done in the past. The Hudson river or the Hudson yards trust comes to mind. It's just a new way that they have to do an end run around the federal government having no capacity to actually help us when we need help. So it's very possible that this is the city making the best of a bad situation, but it doesn't mean that they don't need to be held accountable for the protect the potential runoff from the process, especially because they're talking about floating bonds that will indeed be held by members of the company. Here we go again, so that's how I say. Thank you. Mr Kevin, yeah I, just want to point out. Thank you and Mr. Atkins can have a moment next. I just want to point out that the prior head of NYCHA is no longer the head of NYCHA, because the company that was responsible for maintaining the roofs of the various projects gave a warranty when they first did the moves and then continue to charge when the roofs would leak and they would come in and make repairs. So the warranty that they charged for with the original work and which the city paid for with the original work was a boondoggle. There was no true value to it, because the contractor asked for and was paid for to do, the roof again and again, even though it had sold a warranty service to the city. So it's that type of lack of oversight that should be baked in to having a monitor so to speak, so that you can see that the value for the money paid is being realized, so that I think is one of the that type of boondoggle is one of the key problems that we have Mr Atkins. You want to add something to the discussion. Yes, please I was very pleased that Miss Granville brought up the fact that Senator Schumer commented about the largess that he is attempting to bring to the city. That said, it's an attempt right now we're still under the guidance of the executive branch of Mr Trump and the lady who he has instituted. Who I see on your plea letter. You list her as one of the seven or nine people as an instance of what's going on with the with NYCHA. If you read, the chief is requesting people to be elevator technicians right now, NYCHA houses are tremendously understaffed with elevator technicians, and there have been complaints made that the people are not certified to do the work. You were. You just cited the boondoggle as far as the roof and the fact that there they should have been able to go ahead and call the original contractors in this is a cash cow for contractors who bleed the city, and then you have administrators on the federal level who say that quote democrat cities are inefficient, whereas, but half of that is due to the strictures that they place on government and on regulations right now go ahead. Keep it please. Okay, Mr Callahan's point brings out the fact that there needs to be very in reading into the what is being pushed forward. But the present administration, city and state are finding themselves in a very poor position, and once again you came back or I, don't remember who it was. They brought it up, but if they're going to be floating bonds, that's the red herring and that always goes back to the one thing. I talk about banking and people using this city as a cash cow, and the only people who make out are the financiers and the people who work with them, and this is a huge cash cow 40 50 60 years ago, when these nature houses were first put into place, they weren't run as shoddly as they are. They've been allowed to deteriorate because the demographics in them changed. If the new administration is able to go ahead and move forward, maybe we will be able to see a reversal of that, but this is a very bad situation and the handwriting is already on the wall. If you read the news articles, if you read the city or rag, the chief you can see where it's the city is failing. Thank you. Madam, chair can I say something who is that? Oh okay, I know someone personally that lives in one of those NYCHA houses, the smaller ones and they forced practically no everybody in the building to sign these new lease. Under this new thing of privatizing, whoever is going to be taking over these buildings, so the whole building had to sign these new leases and, as of the last person to sign the lease for the past two days, they had no heat. When now the people called into NYCHA refused to make a response to the heat you know. So this game plane is going back and forth. You know so. Miss Granville I really would like to know more. I'm trying to get this person to give me a copy of their old lease to this new lease and see you know exactly okay and as soon as I do I'll contact you. Okay, thank you both unless there are other questions on housing, we're going to move on to the portfolio, hello, I, this whole thing with the pack NYCHA, because that's what it's called Pat. Yes, what's your question statement? My statement is that they they're sending out a lot of these packets because we're I mean I'm in one of them: packets, my development and we're all still confused as well too so and someone I called someone. Yesterday she came, she got back to me. She explained to me that it's going to be converted from NYCHA to section 8. everything's, going to be section 8 managed by private the private entities and that the leases will be the same. She said it would be the same even when the packet it says, gonna be the same as if we were still NYCHA, but it's still under HUD, so when they start because I wasn't able to do come on to their webinar, but we haven't won next week. Okay, this there's one because I got the letter today. One is the 15th. The one is the 14th December 14th and the next one is December 17th, okay, so they're going to explain how everything is going to be done inside these apartments, what the work is going to be how the work is going to be done and everything. So you know it's all new, but I'm going to contact somebody I know as well, who already has been in this pack thing for about a couple of months and find out what who, how is it working for them? Okay, you know so I'll get back to you with that. Okay, you didn't see an increase in your rent. It we're not in that phase. Yet we're my development is in the phase of finding out everything that we didn't do anything yet did we're the next set. That's going to go into this phase next year, yeah there's a link to the webinar available to non-tenants I, don't know, can you scan a copy of the invitation or send the link to the board office and to myself and Ms Granville? Sure I can do that. Okay, thank you. Any anything else on this right now, no okay! So unless there's something else on housing, we're going to move on to the Parks Committee, yes good evening, everyone this is going to Andrews reporting on the Parks Committee minutes. We met on December the first and we just would like to let you guys know our own Marvel Henry that we have on the community board. Now is the new lead person for the friends of Broward Park since Robert left, so thank you Barbara for being at the meeting to give us a good report. They're gonna have it's my park day on December 12th, so you know to help you know clean up the park marvel. What time is that supposed to start it's? The leaf crunch from 11 am to 1 pm two hours. Yes, okay and the next thing I wanted to know about the tree. Lighting I know it's not going to be a ceremony, but what day is the tree supposed to be lit up? The tree is lit. We were out in the park, yes with the forestry department on Wednesday December 9th. So we had gotten word that council member Carnegie was doing his gift giveaway and food distribution in Brower Park. So we said it would be nice to have the tree lit that day, so we were able to get forestry out and they lit the tree in the morning on December 9th. So it's lit now. Yes, okay, thank you. So much for that report just wanted to let you also know that Greg Todd reported that the comp they're going to be three locations of closing of the compost forms and which is going to be one of them, is where the locations one is at the lower Manhattan and one is in red hook and the other one is by the Queensborough Ed Koch Bridge. He reported that a lot of people are going to be losing their jobs because of this and parks. The parks Department did not get in give any reason why they're closing these compost locations they sent media letters. They tried to. You know see if they could make a you know, turnaround decision and to no avail they're closing these locations, but he said that there are still collecting compost at the Mo Imani Garden, that's on the corner of Schenectady and Pacific during the hours of on every saturdays. From 11 to 2 and on Wednesday between 8 and 10, okay, these compost collection will be sent to Staten Island, the Staten Island on location all right. So another thing is that on October, the 22nd I attended this virtual meeting with New York City parks and NYCHA concerning kingsborough housing playground. They plan to do some capital project there. They want to upgrade the playground- and you know, do resurfacing of the ground and you know do some changes there, so they wanted to the community board to attend the meeting to get our you know. Take on it. It's the you know. It's just a. It was a brainstorming meeting, some of the things they talked about. They wanted to do new equipments in the playground, update the benches resurface, the ground, the lighting, improve the lighting and make sure they have maintenance. There will be many more future meetings and eventually, once they have a design, they will be bringing their desire to the Parks Committee for our approval. So I would just keep you abreast on that and let you know more in the near future. Our next meeting will be January 5th 2021. That's it. Thank you Mrs Andrews. We have two more committee reports coming up and then we can hear from Ms chambers from the Brooklyn Da's office if she's still with us. So next up is public safety and then the seniors Committee may be not sure. Thank you for your report. Ms Andrews public safety is next hi, guys it's Mark Thornton from public safety. First I want to thank my public safety team for this semester. For all your work, we've been meeting two times a month to for public safety. One time was a planning meeting, and the second time is our regular meeting. So team I appreciate your efforts. Thank you very much for everything. Our last meeting was on no Monday November 23rd. We changed the format a little bit and we're going to probably do that going on. We had, in addition to the police, giving their usual update on crime stats in the community. We also had representatives from neighbor neighbors in action, say: Sos save our streets, they came and they did a presentation about what they're doing their anti-violence efforts that they're doing and it was pretty in-depth. We had Derek Scott, Rashawn, Johnson and also William Mccain, and he they all participated on it, and it was a very good discussion. It was pretty moving I think everybody got some good information from it and hopefully we'll continue in that way with having different people different things other than just policing. One more thing we have going on. We have officer Laverne Green from the community Affairs Department she's, going to be leaving the 77 presets she's, going to be going over to one police, plaza she's, going to be going over there with detective Sasha, Louise Pierre, so they're joining forces they're going to be going over to one they both will be missed. They've been in the precinct for quite a while Sasha's been in here for a while for 20 years and officer green for about another 10 years, so they're wrong. They will be missed, they're going to be replaced by officer, John, Jennibart and Officer. Kalan I mean well willing. Sorry, so they're going to be I'll. Ask you to come to our community affair, our public safety meetings and also to our meetings that we're having here and what else we have going on NCOS for the NCOS. We don't have any dates for the NCO meeting for the first quarter of 2021 that hopefully that'll be coming out for the summer and the fall it was done outdoors because of the Covid-19 I think that's gonna. They may do it indoors this year or maybe zoom so we'll see what they're gonna be doing for 2021. That word should be coming out shortly and for December we're not going to be meeting for December due to the Christmas holiday, but we'll be meeting in January. That's going to be the fourth month in January, that's January, the 25th Monday January 25th at six o'clock, we'll be giving out nervous and okay. What's going on, that's about it and have happy holidays, everyone Thurton! Thank you! So much. You have been a regular dynamo trying to pull things together with all of these shootings that are going on and truly appreciate. The extra work that you're putting in to try to get a handle on that ways raise public awareness of how we can make our community safer. Thank you so much so moving on to the next committee report. Well, possibly at this point, let me ask if Ms Karen Chambers is still with us from the Brooklyn Da's office and if she'd like to make some comments or bring us up to date on what's going on at the Da's office, she might be gone. Miss chambers. Are you still with us? It's likely she's still gone. She is gone by now, so we'll proceed with the last committee report from the Seniors Committee Dale's, not on and I, don't know if any other member has a report. Okay, so she had asked to be excused. I thought, maybe another committee member would step in so that'll. Take care of committee reports for this meeting. Is there any old business we need to revisit or pick up on any new business? We've talked about doing letters so we'll be working with the appropriate people to get those bits of correspondence together and out the door. I have some notes: yes, go ahead: Michelle, okay, first I want to thank the community board for sending out the notice about the Crown, Heights, North holiday, decorating contest, so I ask that you pay attention to that and participate and spread the word in Crown heights North and secondly, Crown Heights North will be holding its first zoom meeting next Wednesday at 7 p.m. We're going to be providing an update on the Hebron project as well as we're going to do a Crown, Heights, North, Fun fact, quiz. If you go to our website, you'll get the login information, so we hope everyone will join us and we're wishing everyone a happy, safe and healthy holiday season. Thank you, Ms, Young, so glad to hear Crown Heights North Association is moving things along. So if there's nothing else, am I missing. Anything in the chat, Mrs Weatherspoon, nothing in the chat. Well, then, we leave yes, Mrs Good, let's make a gift hi. How are you miss George? I'm not sure if you got the email I sent the other night, but imperial bikers is feeding the hungry on Sunday December 20th from two to five. It will be the to go edition. We usually invite people into our clubhouse. Whoever is hungry. We service our. We are in the middle of a lot of filters. Excuse me I'm sorry, but we're feeding the hungry, but it's a to-go edition, so we will pack the food. It will be hot. The neighbors and everyone really appreciate that. But if anyone's welcome to come out, we will be outside the clubhouse from two to five on Sunday December 25th, we're located on the corner of Saint Martin Franklin Avenue. Yes, we put that in our newsletter. Also, oh, thank you also miss ties. We do have Allison Brundt. That would like to speak please. This is under public comment, so we can call for public comments. Now, please go ahead. Thank you. Miss with zoom, okay, I'm muted great. Thank you so much hi everyone. My name is Allison Brenderet and I want to talk about a resolution. It's not really to cover 19, but it's really related to all of us here. It's called resolution number 71, which calls upon the state legislation to define honey and create stricter standards for honey sold in New York state I think it's really important that the council pass this resolution, because it has great ramifications for the health and well-being of New Yorkers and people in community board. Eight as well, honey is a valuable commodity which makes it highly susceptible to adulteration. Substances such as high fructose, corn syrup rice syrup, antibiotics and metals have all been found in adulterated honey and, while sixty percent of the honey consumed in the U.S is imported, the FDA just tests five percent of it. Sorry, four other states have already sought ways to reduce the threats of adulterated honey and, besides, protecting the financial interests of local honey producers, as well as the health of consumers. These are a vital part of our ecosystem and we need people to maintain or even start new apiaries throughout the state or in crown heights or in the city at large, which brings me to my last point: New Yorkers are dependent on food produced both in the city and the state. In fact, 15 to 30 percent of the food we eat is pollinated by bees or one in every three bites. Along with many other parts of the world, the state is experiencing a declining honey bee Population every year for the past 10 years, as many as 68 of the state's colonies have died. Importantly, urban areas like New York City actually protect these against many of the major environmental threats in the city. Bees are exposed to a wider variety of food sources and less pesticides and insects inside more commonly found in suburban and rural areas and creating higher standards for honey could also encourage small apiaries to register with the state which can help scientists keep track of and stop the spread of disease traveling between colonies. In closing, I just want to ask. We advocate for the bees for the well-being of New Yorkers and our environment by asking our council members to show their support for the resolution for resolution number 71. I can send a brief policy brief as well, if you're interested in and present at the health committee as well. Thank you so much Miss Tyus Celine Rosado. Just please briefly make an announcement, hello. Everyone thank you for hearing me out. Celine Rosado, here, co-owner of sweet Brooklyn bar founding member of the Notion Avenue Bar, and restaurant association, I just kind of wanted to bring you guys up to date with something we're doing for the holiday season. It's not as many initiatives as we did for Thanksgiving, but we're able to work together with a few non-profit organizations as well as Crown Heights North Association, to get our street closed again for our destination, no stream winter village, December 19th from 11, am to 7 pm. We have the support from our community affairs and our 7-7 precinct. So from 12 o'clock to 1 o'clock, we'll be having you know the normal announcements from one to four. We were lucky enough to have the Lincoln Block Association President, Mr Maribel offered to be our Santa from one to four. The watchful eye will be doing health screenings care children. Achieving results effectively will be sponsoring us and giving away some backpacks and toys and learning stuff to the kids that day and then embrace her legacy is sponsoring us, as our non-profit, who will come out and just speak to the kids, about mentorship programs and mental health awareness and we'll be creating somewhat of a little like a tent and lights and trees, and just something safe for everybody to come out and you know get their kids out. The house- and you know just kind of be happy for a second and try to forget that we are in a pandemic. However, we will be enforcing mandatory mass marrying social distancing, a limited amount of people on the street and we do have the support of all our black associations so pass the word along. If you can. Thank you very much. Do you have a flyer that we could post I do I sent it to Gail, who I think sent it to Deb I? Think she's on the quad enough? She has it yet I sent it at like seven. So there's always the Community Board office as well. Okay, I need that. Can somebody send that to me and I: don't have that in, like my contacts, yet we'll put it in the chat? Thank you so much also Ms Tyus I would like to mention that for the last 20 years, members of community boarding have advocated for handicap accessibility at the Brooklyn museum subway station two and three that has finally been completed. Next Thursday we are having that we, the MTA New York City transit, will be having a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The unveil the handicap accessibility at the Brooklyn museum, everyone's invited to attend. It starts at 1:30 p.m. So next Thursday the 17th 1:30 P.M Eastern Parkway Washington Avenue. Thank you very much. I did see that and I'm glad you brought it up. They had Eastern Parkway, throttled down for over a year. It seems to get that elevator in place and I. Remember Mr Atkins, asking year after year when this is going to happen. So this is good that started a long time ago, but I imagine you're planning to attend. Miss George, yes, I am and Mr Witherwax is head of transportation. Will you be planning to attend? Well he's off. He got off okay, so this is good. Thank you so much for bringing that up. It is definitely a course to celebrate, because so many people have terrible accidents and loses you lose their use of their legs and at least with something like this. They can have a chance to visit such a wonderful place as a Brooklyn museum and we're very lucky to have it in or near our district, so that we can take advantage of the beautiful art. That's there. Thank you for bringing that up. Is there anything else that we need to share tonight before we look to close the meeting? No well, then I asked for a motion to close the meeting. Hello I'll make him make a motion to close our meeting. Second, thank you. Nice turned we'll see you all second Thursday in January in a brand new year, how they say: I'll, see you next year and stay safe.
