Yes, It is, and I just want to make sure that everyone knows that we appreciate that we're all still here.
Thank you all for coming tonight with that, since we're not voting on anything, I'm, going to turn this back to senator Schumer, to give us his updates and information on legislation and what he sees coming.
Thank you for coming and I will try to talk for about 10 minutes and since we started a little later, I'll leave about 10:15 minutes for questions.
So I want to say thank you for your service community Board 8 is Crown.
So I know how important this board is to the future, not only of New York City, but really of America.
We did the first time out, and another thing we're trying to do is make sure that there's enough money, just what Ethel mentioned, to distribute the vaccine for free to everybody safely, so that by March or April, when everybody who wants the vaccine gets it, we should be a different place, And I'm fighting very hard to get it.
That's why I know your district so well, If I get I'm trying to be majority leader, If we win the two seats in Georgia, I will be majority leader and all these good things I can put on the floor of the Senate instead of Mcconnell having the ability to block them because he's a majority leader now and most of them will pass and if a majority leader I just want to tell you we're trying to win in Georgia.
Money to communities, and another thing we want to do is called the Economic Justice Act, which should really benefit board.
I am a big defender of public housing and I will push very hard to get that done if we get in the majority and if we get a bigger bill when Biden becomes president the bill I mentioned is a down payment, but if Biden cuts in we're going to try to do a much bigger bill that stimulates, the economy creates more jobs, etcetera, not just to deal with emergency and one other thing.
In our in this bill in the Heroes act, we're trying to pass had a hundred billion dollars for rental assistance, That's not new housing and that's not construction, but for to keep people in their homes who are getting kicked out because they're losing their jobs and can't pay.
We do use some of it for job creation and things like that very important, and so we're going to try to get both those things done in the Senate.
As for other means such as you mentioned the tax on each transaction and things like that, Those two would be on the table, we're going to figure out the best way: capital gains, getting rid of carried interest.
Then I attended a seminar at Nyu earlier in the spring, with one of the members of the board and the community Reinvestment Act was discussed and all the panelists who were truthful in private conversations and all the people there found that it's still an inadequate vehicle to help housing and redevelopment initiatives within the city and at the time I was under the Mis guided point that it was a quarter of a million per institution.
And I would look forward to you, bringing along with the other economic initiatives, to help the people of this community surrounding communities in all of New York City in their endeavors to try and get better and better housing.
That Trump put together for the big corporations eliminates that and puts it into minority and poorer communities, part of it for housing, part of it for job training, part of it for infrastructure and part of it for youth and school programs for people, and it would be much better than Cra when Cra started.
Now then, There are two more small initiatives of working towards the public banking initiative, that's already being brought forward in the house, aligning that in the Senate, and also in the same 350 billion dollars that you've just earmarked or you're.
I mean people talked about a moratorium being in place here in New York, but it is not no longer in place and evictions have already started in Brooklyn.
A lot of people have been pushing for rent cancellation at the New York state level, but I would hope that our federal elected officials are also paying attention to this.
We're going to need to do our roll call, so I would ask our Earthwow Secretary Mr wither wax to proceed with the board roll Paul good evening.
So in terms of that, The session for the state legislature will be starting on January 6 and there's a lot of work to do for our community and the Senator.
We really gonna push forward and like make sure that bill gets past next session to provide much needed relief for our tenants, but also for our small businesses that are hurting.
Let me pull up the action items, so the Slack committee met Monday December 7th at to buy a Webex virtual meeting.
Carlton is seeking to renew their full license at the meeting that at this time of this application, a quorum was not present for this item, but the committee discussed approving the application and hopes that the full board votes in support of renewing this liquor.
The we've worked requirement for this portion of the meeting, and the committee voted to support this application with a final vote of 10 in favor, with one abstention and hopes that the full board support its recommendation.
You know a couple seconds to see if I see any indicators, I don't see any questions, So I'll refer to Ms Tyus to ask for the vote.
I. Think I just want to make a couple announcements, just to kind of increase our awareness and share that there are a couple options right now that we can do if you're, having or see issues with operations of a business regarding Covid-19 standards or social distancing or outside setups.
If this is a major public violation, a public health violation, but certainly, if you're a neighbor to an establishment that you might be having some issues with I, strongly encourage you to look at this program and to work with the operator directly as opposed to trying to bring enforcement down on them needlessly during this kind of difficult times.
If it's within your means or your wherewithal to do, so, I would strongly suggest you select a couple of locations in our community board district and look at that as an option for gifting a gift certificate, a future dinner out a small shop, even not necessarily a restaurant, but really try to look at our small businesses along our corridors.
So we're going to move on to the next committee report and I will ask Miss Daniel to the resolutions for the land.
The application, lpc2100136 for certificate of appropriate fitness to legalize facade, work and installation of mailbox in non-compliance with certificate of no effect 16-7468 for 875 St, Marks Avenue in the Crown Heights North historic district.
And, whereas the committee members again voiced concerns regarding saying undesirable precedence by supporting supplementation from owners requesting forgiveness for out of character, work done in violation of LPC permit and, whereas basically sorry go ahead and whereas, based on the revised scope of the project work as presented and on condition that the additional violations previously listed have been resolved at LPC staff level committee member Lisa Lizzer moves the committee to support the revised scope of work for legalizing, inappropriate, facade work for the second time as young and.
Support for the above, described, application for certificate of appropriateness for correcting work done in violation of Lpc's permit and recommends that the full board do the same.
Any questions on this resolution to support legalization of the work done at 875 St Marks Avenue in the Crown Heights North historic, district, I'm, not seeing anything in the chat, any comments, questions seeing none is for Motion James Ellis.
Mr Witherwax I want to point out to all the members in the audience that we have explicating report for Miss Daniels with a blow by blow on what was done in the land, use committee, Yes, application for a certificate of appropriateness to install a rooftop, stair bulkhead at 97, St, Marks Avenue in the Prospect Heights historic district, whereas Brian Ripple of confined architecture and interiors presented owner's plans for rooftop terrace and access to the proposed terrace requires a bulkhead opening in line with the existing staircase.
Terrace will be porcelain, pavers and whereas the visibility of the proposed bulkhead was described as minimal from Saint Mark's Avenue, An assertion that could not be confirmed by a committee member, because a recent windstorm had blown down the mock-up and there was concerned voice regarding the color and position of the bulkhead, But the concern was not pursued and whereas Mr Ripple indicated the project is scheduled for a hearing before LPC in January 2021 Mr Verconi moves the committee to support the proposal with a second by Ms, Weatherspoon and 17 members voted 17 committee members voted to support.
Therefore, be it resolved that the committee recommends, support for the above, described application or certificate of appropriateness for construction of a rooftop bulkhead and recommends that the full board do the same, Yes, I, wanted to say that, as the discussion that we just heard reflected, It was not possible to see the mock-up prior to this item coming before the land use Committee.
Since that time the mock-up has been restored and a couple of our the Phndc Landmarks committee members have gone to look at the mock-ups and not feel that it is minimally visible from Saint, Mark's, avenue.
We, had gotten really short notice of this application, and, as I said, that the mock-ups were not available to look at before the land, Use Committee meeting.
Are there any questions from committee members on this, seeing that I asked for a motion on this changed condition from a community board.
Can't speak on behalf of the whole community, board, but, as I said, phndc will be testifying that we would like to see the bulkhead either reduced in size or moved, and.
The community board take all of those positions because they weren't raised at the land use committee meeting, but perhaps I would move that the community board conditioned its support on the being reduced so as not to be visible from Saint Mark's Avenue.
This board can and should import wholesale I think Phnbc's determinations for the four amendments to the motion of support, because we rely all the time on organizations like Phdc and China to do the groundwork on this.
We can ask Miss, George or Ms Neil to make the information the photos and plans available to the full board before we go into a full board meeting, so that those full board members who are concerned about items coming in from land use committee can take a look at them before we go into a full board.
I just wanted to share as a member of that committee that was present that evening.
Okay, so the next one is Daniel is 294, Albany I think that's a pretty short item: application, lpc19 for a certificate of appropriateness to legalize the door in small terrace and rear facade for 294 Albany avenue in the Crown Heights North historic, district.
They wanted to come back this month and we had to explain to them that we don't meet twice as a committee during any particular month.
And, I, think the next committee up for presentation is economic, Development, Mr, Saunders, hello, good evening, Everyone I'd, like to report.
Is there a land use meeting between now and their LPC hearing, where the applicant would be asked to re-present, Given the findings that Mpha was.
97 Saint marks is going to go straight to LPC, and the letter that goes from the community board to LPC will reflect this evening's deliberations, and this evening's vote.
We generally ask for applicants that don't get committee support and don't get full board support to come back to committee, so we can try to fix whatever.
They, The LPC, keeps a close watch on what the committee the community boards are recommending to it.
You want to make a report now sure the youth and Education Committee met on December 1st.
There was some discussion about whether or not virtual school is being successful for all students, especially given the fact that there are non-traditional caregivers at home, who may not either have access to the digital devices or know how to use digital devices and need you know, assistance with helping the students in those ways and also concern was expressed about whether or not the kids were sent home with paper, materials, books, work, packets and things like that, so that, If they don't have the digital devices, whether or not they'd be able to do it.
I. Think it's going to be an issue of distributing the survey getting if anyone knows of teachers that could distribute, amongst other teachers within their schools, within the district, reaching out to Cec, 16 and 17.
Then, if you send me the survey and I'm so sorry, I missed that meeting, because this is like all the stuff we're working on now.
We'll move on to environment, sanitation and Transportation Committee report, I'm, going to thank you, Miss Tess.
I'm, going to cede my own time to myself for the bylaws committee, because we need to action on the bylaws tonight.
We've made the chair very clearly the chair of the board, a non-voting member of all committees.
Any questions from committee from board.
I would like to thank the committee for its work.
Ms Mahoney I want to ask health and the other committees to try to make sure you have your agenda in your meeting, notices that get posted on the board calendar that I find that very attractive to potential attendees and I.
It means that their right to remain in this housing would be based on the private developers and on market concerns and market conditions, and a lot of what New, York City housing should be attending to at this time.
Yes, I after last night's hearing, I had some time to do some research, because I knew that we're trying to put together a statement on behalf of the housing committee.
Oh, okay, I know someone personally that lives in one of those NYCHA houses, the smaller ones, and they forced practically no everybody in the building to sign these new lease.
Okay, Thank you both unless there are other questions on housing, we're going to move on to the portfolio, hello, I.
But I'm going to contact somebody I know as well, who already has been in this pack thing for about a couple of months and find out what who, how is it working for them.
So unless there's something else on housing, we're going to move on to the Parks Committee.
This is going to Andrews reporting on the Parks Committee minutes.
Another thing is that on October, the 22nd I attended this virtual meeting with New York City parks and NYCHA concerning kingsborough housing, playground.
All your work, we've been meeting two times a month to for public safety.
Ask you to come to our community affair, our public safety meetings and also to our meetings that we're having here and what else we have going on NCOS for the NCOS.
Michelle, okay, First I want to thank the community board for sending out the notice about the Crown, Heights, North, holiday, decorating contest, so I ask that you pay attention to that and participate and spread.
I think it's really important that the council pass this resolution, because it has great ramifications for the health and well-being of New Yorkers and people in community board.
The house- and you know just kind of be happy for a second and try to forget that we are in a pandemic.
