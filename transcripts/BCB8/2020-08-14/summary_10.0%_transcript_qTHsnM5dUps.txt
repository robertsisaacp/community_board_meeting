Thank you, okay, so we're going to go over the opportunities we have for public realm improvements in the upcoming m crown neighborhood rezoning, and we have with us chief of Staff Tasha Young for my Majority Leader Council Majority leader Lori Cumbo.
So, basically, just going back to a letter that Ms Young did back in May. The basics are opportunities for development of city, owned properties, including new, affordable, housing, opportunities for improving open space and public realm features, economic Development, Workforce, Development, schools and other community facilities, sanitation and quality of life, issues and transportation.
Doing, a little research along with council land use on what other rezonings have done in you know successful rezonings in the city, so we borrowed a few highlights from different rezonings in both the Bronx and Manhattan and kind of glommed out what we think could be applicable for M crown so on to the So. Just the zoning itself.
So since 2016 the city tracks, neighborhood planning commitments and implementation annually on the website, which is where we got a lot of this information from then we just take a look at the surrounding areas to the M Crown zone.
So other types of public land offer opportunity for development of community beneficial uses such as affordable housing combined with education or art, space.
This is something that can also be imagined for the tracks that are here at Franklin and Saint: Mark's, green space, gardening, just public use above ground like other areas in the city and here at ps3 and hancock playground.
We have more DOE property that again could be on the table to be improved, to be renovated to be activated into a better use of this space for public for public realm improvements bless We, start talking about another city agency, HPD, which I've really been keeping my eye on with these current budget cuts.
Knowing that how important commercial uses are to m Crown SBS is another partner that the community board would like to liaise with.
We consider supporting private Applica, or should you consider supporting private applications that match the M ground framework, discuss pros and cons very important conversation, and if there's no immediate commitment to implement zoning, how should the community planning work be?
On that right- hand, panel, okay, so I'm going to ask one or two leading questions and then, as people post their questions, Mrs Weatherspoon will bring that forward And Ms Young on the the affordable housing issues.
Yes, elaine weinstein would like to find out how the open space will be prioritized in relation to the Bergen and Dean Street lots right, so hi Tasha thanks so much for taking the question.
Looking at the map of opportunities in the powerpoint, I just wanted to address all their located relative to the density, because I think it's of the Community Board and a Brooklyn general name.
All of that work, who's going to pay for that, but should we consider supporting private applications as council member Rep, Tasha Young asked in the questions for the next step, and it's something that one of the main proponents of this app this rezoning has been asking over time.
You know together talk with other city, agencies, Answer, your questions, respond to your concerns and address them to the best way possible so that you can, then we can then, together, put together a client, okay, just a second.
I, think that process you know takes quite a bit of time and leads up to discussing zoning and land use.
Here we have developed neighborhood plan land use, application, urban design, Zoning, Capital, Plan, draft scope of work, draft environmental Impact, statement.
Application itself or the scope, but urban design, zoning capital planning and though- And I just want to say those- are very robust, complicated things that requires back and forth with with agencies a lot of coordination internally within the department.
You know the foundational stuff that's necessary to move these timelines ahead at some point is important, and I also believe that some of these tasks listed under developed neighborhood plan would be important tasks that would yield meaningful information for the rest of the community as well, so, for instance, urban design and zoning, I think, would be very helpful to get into, to the extent that we could that we could create a draft zoning plan, which is something that many of the community members and many of the committee members on this call, I think, have expressed interest.
I mean again we're talking about putting together something a plan, and that obviously is based upon an understanding of what the community would like to see happen here and then how to accomplish it and is absolutely right.
I mean we're talking about the need, the desire to create affordable housing that requires changes in the zoning.
There is no requirement right now in any of the zoning, not in any excuse me, but there is no requirement in many of the areas of this community district of for affordable housing to be included in new development right, and so that's something that we can work on like where indian Crown area.
You know that the Community board has adopted, and so what we're talking about now is taking that to the next step and proposing zoning around it, and that I guess I'm saying that's: something.
Here, While we're working on while we're working on public engagement and engaging with agencies, I think that putting together the draft zoning is an important activity for us, and I I'm only speaking for myself, but it seems like something we should consider focusing on at this stage.
I think we consider those part and parcel just as important as a zoning, proposal, and I We would like to see you all understand what the city's tools are and how they can be implemented alongside a zoning avery zoning and to make sure that there is a comfort level here in the community.
And I, at the one hand, I hear you agreeing that we can do a draft zoning plan, but then a moment later, I'm reluctant to ask you for a revision to this improm draft process and timeline that gives up so that we can see and looking for a memorialization about understanding when and where this project is going.
I think over hearing fear from a fear of unbridled increased density as potential private applicants point at Pacific atlantic arts Pacific park and say they want to harmonize their proposed developments with that, and this is another reason why I believe, we've documented that this community board will not support private applications in general.
The concerns that you're voicing about that you're hearing from members of this audience about increased density is because they have not fully joined in the Community board's resistance to in private applications, which is something that we will be memorializing at our full board, meeting, either in September or October, so that there is no question that would[ _ _] The progress of this neighborhood rezoning in the in the in the eyes of DCP that we're not sure about what we want.
For those who do not know, me, I, think what we're saying is that we're committed to working on developing the zoning and the urban design framework and all of the associated kind of policies that we can.
I. Just think we need to modify what our goals and what our plan is on the basis of resources, and we- I just want to just have it known that we have two people that are waiting for a while now to ask a question, so I, just desmond will be first and Sarah will be next just to Now , okay, I'm, really just trying to follow this as someone who's kind of new to the landis processes and euler processes, and trying to learn and catch up.
I'm understanding is that you know obviously the city's it's the city budget that is vastly diminished because of the crisis, And so it's the environmental impact statement that is the most expensive thing to produce, So that's the piece that is forcing all of this to be delayed, but some of the other things are less expensive, like the urban design and capital planning, etc.
I think those are great questions, and so absolutely we want to work on the community engagement.
It's looking at everything from parks open space streets sewers, so we often describe that as public realm, but it's kind of a much broader umbrella of infrastructure and also of priorities that we hear from from the community, and then I guess the reason I'm answering.
But in terms of the I mean in fairness, because this member of the this committee is not able to fully explain the question, but an enviro, any any land use change requires some form of environmental review and the more significant the change is.
Think the next meeting with you should be where we we can tell you when and where we can meet with the next city agency and whatever information you want, You actually just give us an updated plan, a time and event schedule that looks like what was presented in April?
Right, we presented you with information about the demographic change in the community and What is what is the effect on housing And It would be good for you to hear from our housing agency from HPD about the programs that they have and the and the methods and tools that they have to increase the amount of affordable housing in the city.
Do not think they are, but The community board has not changed its objectives for the M crown plan.
You know what can be done in house by city planning to show what streets may look like, or can we take cut and paste images of other buildings that are the heights of these opportunities showing which sites might change based on how much zoning change These are exercises that can happen over many months to help inform people right.
In addition to learning about where you might be able to figure out squeezing out more park space or affordable housing beyond Mih. That could be an area where city planning is much more need than its sister agencies.
