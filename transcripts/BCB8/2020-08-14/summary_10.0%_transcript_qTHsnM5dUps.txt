Thank, you, okay, so we're going to go over the opportunities we have for public realm improvements in the upcoming m crown neighborhood rezoning, and we have with us chief of staff, tasha young for my majority leader council majority leader, lori cumbo, who will make an adaptation of suggestions that we've discussed over the past several months.
The basics are opportunities for development of city-owned properties, including new, affordable housing, opportunities for improving open space and public realm features, economic development, workforce development, schools and other community facilities, sanitation and quality of life issues and transportation.
The majority leader was very interested in our office Doing, a little research along with council land use on what other rezonings have done in you know successful rezonings in the city, so we borrowed a few highlights from different rezonings in both the Bronx and Manhattan and kind of glommed out what we think could be applicable for m crown so on to the next slide, So, just the zoning itself, controls use in bulk new buildings.
They will give us the opportunity to look at open space to look economic and workforce development, of course, affordable housing, opportunities for public beneficial development on public land schools, transportation, sanitation, as which was just stated by ethel You see m crown in the middle here which is outlined by the black line, and then we identified public publicly owned spaces publicly owned buildings that are surrounding the m crown area that the improvement The first thing that we looked at were streets and sidewalks, which form the largest area of public land and present diverse opportunities is what atlantic avenue can look like with a redesign of the median?
Another type of public land offer opportunity for development of community uses So. We all armory on atlantic at bedford, avenue and that is currently a men's shelter It has been a men's shelter, but there is the whole open space building behind it that we can look at ways to one In, the event we have any kind of disaster or we need to use that building to lodge people who have been displaced So. Although it's an open area, it cannot be outfitted too much because we would have to break that down in the event.
We have more DOE property that again could be on the table to be improved, to be renovated to be activated into a better use of this space for public for public realm improvements bless We, start talking about another city agency, hpd, which I've really been keeping my eye on with these current budget cuts, but another type of community access is existing, affordable housing So in prior neighborhood studies, hpd has provided analysis of the housing stock in the area and committed to focus existing preservation, programs and pilot new ones Perhaps.
We wanted to include this slide as a tickler for some conversations that can be had with other city agencies such as sbs and EDC A few examples for m crown would be targeted: construction, job training and placement program, top up small business vendor markets, with training grant program to help local residents, participate, fund, local art, artists and organizations to create street art, murals and other public art, targeted zoning and financial incentives for developers to create non-residential space Can we engage in community planning during Covid-19 , 19 being very mindful that people are experiencing two pandemics?
Actually I'm, going to just follow up on what lane said with a couple of points and questions , we're the we're carrying the brunt of the change in community board Looking at the map of opportunities in the powerpoint I just wanted to address all their located relative to the density, because I think it's of the community board and a Brooklyn general name.
I guess I just want to reiterate that you prioritize thinking holistically, not just about m crown, but about all these different developments and how they interest intersect is important and My first question is the city council, member and department city planning looking at it That way?
This is an information gathering session right rather than a policy setting or action planning session for the majority leader staff is action planning for us as community board members, and we should take note and make note of plans that we feel as a group that we can execute once we can come to a agreement on this I would ask mr barack to add to what we have seen already as recommendations over public movements in this neighborhood rezoning, mr bear rock sure so where it was just talked about the hbd sites.
The ep is calling it rain gardens so looking at property front stitches where the community might rather see sometimes within the road beds, sometimes within the sidewalk area, where the sidewalks wide enough to advance these grain gardens into the public realm as an improvement Those are a couple of things and then just because you may have areas where you have roadway widths, which could go on a diet without adversely affecting car flow A couple of things, in addition to the slide that tasha showed where the triangular park could grow into the street So. The board has seen bike lanes added on a bunch of those streets, especially the east-west streets, but there are many more east-west streets there that don't need to be main traffic flow like you're having or south streets, except for buffalo, that's interrupted by the public housing Should more bike lanes be proposed in other corridors, but the other thing that's in this community is diagonal parking Would it make sense to have some streets become diagonal parking as a way to slow the cars down and yet create more supply before of well parking or street is affordable, so, especially as more density comes into neighborhood and smaller housing developments are not required to provide parking.
And you know, can we demonstrate that we have a public process that is moving forward in some way , in that vein, what I would ask is I think a good, even if you know we're not able to move into euler if we can, if we can come up with and get to the point where we've created a scope for the euler process, we've gotten public input on the scope, The questions that you have raised to bring in agencies to answer your questions, to react to your ideas, to your concerns and to first come up with a plan If I may just to rationalize that in terms of the timeline we were discussing before you know, we were looking at getting to a scoping hearing.
You know together talk with other city agencies, answer your questions, respond to your concerns and address them to the best way possible so that you can then we can then together, put together a client, okay, just a second The community boards will be looking at upcoming budgeting If we could get from your office, budget ranges for the parts that gibb is about to walk through.
That would be the idea that we continue to work together and and develop a zoning proposal together when no now I want to be- I mean again we're talking about putting together something a plan, and that obviously is based upon an understanding of what the community would like to see happen here and then how to accomplish it and is absolutely right.
I mean we're talking about the need, the desire to create affordable housing that requires changes in the zoning There is no requirement right now in any of the zoning, not in any excuse me, but there is no requirement in many of the areas of this community district of for affordable housing to be included in new development right, and so that's something that we can work on like where indian crown area Where should what should the zoning be?
You know that the community board has adopted, and so what we're talking about now is taking that to the next step and proposing zoning around it, and that I guess I'm, saying that's something That's that I think many of the committee members have expressed an interest in seeing and is kind of the logical next step.
I think over hearing fear from a fear of unbridled increased density as potential private applicants point at Pacific atlantic arts Pacific park and say they want to harmonize their proposed developments with that, and this is another reason why I believe we've documented that this community board will not support private applications in general So. The concerns that you're voicing about that you're hearing from members of this audience about increased density is because they have not fully joined in the community board's resistance to in private applications, which is something that we will be memorializing at our full board meeting, either in september or october, so that there is no question that would retard the progress of this neighborhood rezoning in the in the in the eyes of dcp that we're not sure about what we want.
Engagement and part of that is just relates to capital planning as well, but I would say that so maybe I'll answer this your question in two parts, so first capital planning is based on whenever we're considering growth in a larger area, we're looking at a whole assortment of projects that support that growth and also the surrounding community It's looking at everything from parks, open space, streets, sewers We often describe that as public realm, but it's kind of a much broader umbrella of infrastructure and also of priorities that we hear from from the community That first is because that relates back to the community engagement, in that we so for the environmental review that requires consultant work.
What we expect to be able to accomplish during the term at the remaining term of the administration at our october meeting and what I thought I thought I heard you say was yes, so it is your interest in in what it is that you want to learn about right when we, when we were when we were speaking when we were meeting earlier this year right, we presented you with information about the demographic change in the community, and What is what is the effect on housing and It would be good for you to hear from our housing agency from hpd about the programs that they have and the and the methods and tools that they have to increase the amount of affordable housing in the city.
We would love to discuss with you once it's completed, show you a zoning proposal and discuss it with you and make changes to it as necessary so that we can put this all together, but we need to hear from you what it is that it is that you are interested in learning, more We, don't know who the next mayor's going to be, but that's what we're asking you for I really think we have to focus on an update to what was previous to the timeline that was presented in april.
