What is that we need everyone to mute themselves. Thank you, okay, so we're going to go over the opportunities we have for public realm improvements in the upcoming m crown neighborhood rezoning, and we have with us chief of staff, tasha young for my majority leader council majority leader, lori cumbo, who will make an adaptation of suggestions that we've discussed over the past several months and she's gone through the trouble of documenting them with pictures and addresses and fully blown stated, recommendations and suggestions. So then, after that, we should be able to hear from richard barack of the president's office with some additional suggestions that we can all revisit in october. Okay, so with that I'll ask this young to proceed, I'm trying to get her in the ball! Okay! Well, I can say good evening to everybody on behalf of majority leader, lori kumba. I hope everyone's doing well. I hope your families are well in these times that we're living in of uncertainty and it's good to see everyone's face. So I'm trying give me a second here we're here. So, basically, just going back to a letter that ms young did back in may the basics are opportunities for development of city-owned properties, including new, affordable housing, opportunities for improving open space and public realm features, economic development, workforce development, schools and other community facilities, sanitation and quality of life, issues and transportation. So that's just working from the letter, but we've got a beautiful know how to give you the ball. Now we have a beautiful presentation that you all received by email. Am I correct? Did everybody get it? Okay, they can't respond. I hope everybody got it. So wait! I'm trying! I'm still do you have the ball. I think you, okay. Let me try to share my screen. No, I don't have the ball yet! Oh you have it says you have it okay, I'll, try again. So that means that I should be able to share my screen right. Yes, I'm not able to do that. Okay! Oh now! I do okay fabulous all right! So are you all seeing the first page of a powerpoint, it says: m crown opportunities for public realm improvements? Yes, okay, good! So again, thank you. Ethel for the introduction, the majority leader was very interested in our office. Doing a little research along with council land use on what other rezonings have done in you know successful rezonings in the city, so we borrowed a few highlights from different rezonings in both the Bronx and Manhattan and kind of glommed out what we think could be applicable for m crown so on to the next slide. It's just a little bit of you know what happens when we do a rezone for those that don't know like. I did this presentation for staff and they were very happy to learn about like how all of this stuff really works. So just the zoning itself controls use in bulk new buildings. This is old hat for all of you: housing stores and offices, industrial community facilities. So the city-led neighborhood rezonings open the opportunity for a more holistic neighborhood planning. They will give us the opportunity to look at open space, to look economic and workforce development, of course, affordable housing, opportunities for public beneficial development on public land schools, transportation, sanitation as which was just stated by ethel. So since 2016 the city tracks neighborhood planning commitments and implementation annually on the website, which is where we got a lot of this information from then we just take a look at the surrounding areas to the m crown zone. So you see m crown in the middle here which is outlined by the black line, and then we identified public publicly owned spaces publicly owned buildings that are surrounding the m crown area that the improvement. So the first thing that we looked at were streets and sidewalks which form the largest area of public land and present diverse opportunities. So this is a this example is what atlantic avenue can look like with a redesign of the median? So we see both atlantic avenue today and then an example of allen street on the lower east side. So the median is expanded. The street is condensed a little bit for motor traffic, but pedestrian traffic would have more use of atlantic avenue in the median and we could put some greenery there and some other more attractive uses on atlantic avenue. Another example would be lowry triangle, so it's the block of underhill avenue. It could be closed to expand into a useful small park or playground, so you have the a visual example and then just a triangle, diagram of the area that we're talking about. We have a park like this very close to the office in fort greene called betty carter park. So it would be the same idea further down on atlantic avenue park or a small or a playground. So another type of public land offer opportunity for development of community uses would be at the arm. So we all armory on atlantic at bedford, avenue and that is currently a men's shelter. It has been a men's shelter, but there is the whole open space building behind it that we can look at ways to one make it more attractive over there. It's not a very attractive facility to visit or walk through, but it's a potential since it is publicly owned to reimagine what that, what that building is what it looks like there are restrictions because it is the use is of an emergency facility. In the event, we have any kind of disaster or we need to use that building to lodge people who have been displaced. So, although it's an open area, it cannot be outfitted too much, because we would have to break that down in the event. People would have to be housed there, but what can potentially be there again? This is going to take a lot of imagination and some significant resources would be perhaps an art exhibit area because exhibit can be put up and broken down. Perhaps music studio, space, dance, studio, space, there's a few cultural uses that might be able to be housed there in that part of the building. That's underutilized or not utilized at all, so other types of public land offer opportunity for development of community beneficial uses such as affordable housing combined with education or art space. So this is and I'm sorry my little square blocks some of my presentation area. That's one half a page at a time. I can't read it, but the example here would be the DOE space on prospect at prospect. Alternate learning center, 178 Brooklyn avenue. So this is an existing space. That is underutilized by DOE in the immediate ethel had mentioned that this could be additional space for schools now in the age of Covid-19 that need to find more space, so the students could social distance properly, but in the long run this could be a number of things. This could be. You know, housing could go above this potentially and anything really that the community would like to discuss. It could probably be discussed at this point on how to how to best utilize, this DOE property, so another type of public land opportunity for development of community beneficial uses would be economic development. So here we have the mta owned properties and land on atlantic and franklin, and this can again be within the study we can discuss what ways the city can utilize these properties in a way that benefits the community. The dcp has agreed to bring in you know the other city agencies to have these discussions, so this would be a discussion with the mta more mta land. Now this particular space here reminds me of the gate: the area in lower Manhattan around the meatpacking district, the gansevoort, where it's like it at the elevated garden and like bike lanes, and things like that are above ground from old shuttle tracks. So this is something that can also be imagined for the tracks that are here at franklin and saint mark's, green space, gardening, just public use above ground like other areas in the city and here at ps3 and hancock playground. We have more DOE property that again could be on the table to be improved, to be renovated to be activated into a better use of this space for public for public realm improvements bless. You, god bless you thank you here. We start talking about another city agency hpd, which I've really been keeping my eye on with these current budget cuts, but another type of community access is existing, affordable housing. So in prior neighborhood studies, hpd has provided analysis of the housing stock in the area and committed to focus existing preservation, programs and pilot new ones. So it's a little small. Perhaps you can or cannot read it, but these are just some examples of housing, commitment commitments that have been made in prior zonings through hpd and hra that we can also look to approach hpd about one. That's particularly important to the majority leader is the senior housing at bergen and d, which is within the m crown zone. But you know there are other opportunities, potentially that we can preserve existing, affordable housing and maybe identify definitely identify new, affordable housing that would go up in the end ground zone and really doing a deep dive with hpd. Right now with the budgets. I would suggest that the community boards be a bit insistent to have attention from the from the agencies, because everyone's gonna be really grappling with budget. Another agency that could potentially be people in because of all the industrialized and commercial presence on atlantic avenue is sbs from the jerome avenue rezoning. They really did some creative planning around relocating some of the industry that was on jerome avenue, to make room for residential and to make room for different kinds of commercial use. So, knowing that how important commercial uses are to m crown, sbs is another partner that the community board would like to liaise with as part of this study on what that would look like if we were to be able to move. You know some of the little auto body shops some of the storage facilities through partnership with sbs, whether it's a grant program or a number of different things that we saw being done uptown. So we wanted to include this slide as a tickler for some conversations that can be had with other city agencies such as sbs and EDC. So a few examples for m crown would be targeted construction, job training and placement program, top up small business vendor markets, with training grant program to help local residents, participate, fund, local art, artists and organizations to create street art, murals and other public art, targeted zoning and financial incentives for developers to create non-residential space. So questions for next steps. How can we engage in community planning during Covid-19, 19 being very mindful that people are experiencing two pandemics? At the same time, and now we have an epidemic of gun violence. So how do we properly engage in community planning? What kind of resources can dcp and other agencies provide? Should we consider supporting private applica, or should you consider supporting private applications that match the m ground framework, discuss pros and cons very important conversation, and if there's no immediate commitment to implement zoning, how should the community planning work be memorialized? How can we, how can the work that you've done for all this time, be wrapped up in a nice, pretty bow for the new administration to just bring it over the finish line, and that ends my presentation. Thank you very much. Thank you. Take the ball back, so I can let the other folks in miss tires. Unmute yourself, miss tires. Okay, all right, so everything I said was love. Thank you, ms young. This has been very informative and I'm sure the audience has questions. So I would ask people to raise their hand in the chat and ask ms george to coordinate that so committee members. Can one of your committee members assist because I'm trying to get presenters michelle okay, so my usual request is to try to get weatherspoon if she would be so kind as to monitor the chat and allow people to bring your questions forward news weatherspoon sure. I appreciate that. Thank you. So, while people trying to get them in perform their questions, you know how to raise your hand or, if you don't, it should be on that right-hand panel. Okay. So I'm going to ask one or two leading questions and then, as people post their questions, mrs weatherspoon will bring that forward and miss young answer. Ms young, on the the affordable housing issues prior neighborhood studies in hpd. When you talk about a preservation programs that I presume that is just preserving or increasing the existing number of housing units as opposed to historic preservation. Okay, I see your head going up and down so that that's a yes, the senior high. Forgive me I'm sorry, I didn't know I was muted. Yes, that's correct! Should there be a historic, you know, preservation initiative in the zone, then we bring in lpc and that's a whole nother process. True enough and well actually, okay, that's true! The senior housing you mentioned of bergen and dean. What is the north south cross street? Do you talk about illegal north? I believe so at though, let me let me get my notes on. I believe I believe so. Welcome to east west burgundy run east west, so we need a north south, fourth street for me to pinpoint the senior housing that you're referring to okay, I'm gonna. Look that up. While we before we get off the phone, I should have an answer for you. Okay. My last question to you before the other folks come in with your questions is the commitment, if there's no immediate commitment to implement zoning, which is something I hope mr blair can help us guys and everyone mute their computers, okay. So then there, how would the community be memorialized? So I'm wondering if we should be considering a memorandum of understanding with city planning and if that would have weight with with the mayor's office, I assumed that it would because dcp does have quote unquote: police powers that spill over to all of the other male agency functions. So that would be one suggestion that I would make. What do you think of that? Ms young? A memorandum of understanding? I don't know that I could really speak for dcp on that. I think I would have to ask the agency what they think about that, but on the surface on the face, I think that, maybe is something that could be explored. Thank you. Okay, with that, I would invite questions from the other attendees participants. Yes, elaine weinstein would like to find out how the open space will be prioritized in relation to the bergen and dean street. Lots right, so hi tasha thanks so much for taking the question. First of all, to clarify those lots are between carlton and sixth avenue. I know because I'm on that block, okay and the question really relates to the fact that you mentioned that that lori cumbo has supported senior housing there, which we have heard before as well. But would there also be an understanding that the neighborhood, not just that housing, but the neighborhood requires more open space and might that be considered? Would laurie combo support that for those particular lots we have been since the onset of Covid-19 really trying to have conversations with hpd regarding bergen and dean from maybe January february. We hadn't gotten that far into the planning, but we're trying to follow up, and I certainly will bring your question back to the majority leader. So she could, then you know pose it when they're ready to move forward. The last time we spoke they're still figuring out how to do this whole thing remotely. Okay, I'm sure, among other things, they're trying to figure out. But yes, I will. I will definitely close that to the majority leader, so she can. She can explore that with them. Okay, the second phase of that question really has to do with whether the majority leader would support or not support upzoning, because it's a middle of the block, development and upzoning in the middle of the block is not something the neighborhood would support. So I think it's something else. We would appreciate you bringing back to to her okay. I will thank you so much. Thank you too. Other questions. Okay, see no other questions at this time. I yes, mr richard barack from the brother, peter crashes, has a question he just put in the chat. He has a question: peter crashes, yeah hi. Actually, I'm going to just follow up on what lane said with a couple of points and questions. So in looking at the you know, I guess, because of where we're located in the northern part of prospecting, look at m crown and atlanta yards we're the we're carrying the brunt of the change in community board. Eight we'll have the greatest density, but there's a couple of pieces of this that are, I think, have to be considered. I also would like to just you know. Looking at the map of opportunities in the powerpoint, I just wanted to address all their located relative to the density, because I think it's of the community board and a Brooklyn general name actually the city which is one of the most dense deadly developed areas in the city of new york. So the first issue that I think is really important and that's a it's a it confuses everything. Panic yards may not be completed, so you have a section and that's the section that contains most of the open space that comes up to vanderbilt, and I have seen that planning. This is so it's exactly adjacent to where m crown is right across I've. Seen that department of city planning justifies, or has at least at some point, justified the density in the northern part of prospect heights being the highest in them ground because of this proximity to atlantic yards. That's excellent! There's no requirement that any developer completed. That is not in the development agreements. There's no obligation, there's no penalty and that's where the open spaces. The elaine raised the manner of the dean like of the potential for open space with dean of the dean street location, which is immediately an adjacent playground and adjacent to the historic district too. That specific site is a is a rare opportunity. The city would have in most areas to expand open space where it's going to be in great demand and also faithful to the new middle school, that's being developed really on the same block and that building the middle school won't have much outdoor open space, it's being located in the only building without dedicated open space in the in Pacific park. The other thing I'm so I guess I just want to reiterate that you prioritize thinking holistically, not just about m crown, but about all these different developments and how they interest intersect is important and I'm asking so. My first question is the city council, member and department city planning looking at it. That way, are they looking at the opportunities in the area relative to all of these projects together at once, and they are all moving together at once in the second part of it, I'm actually going to take this a little bit further than the land and say that what we've heard from hpd is that actually they do intend to pursue a minimum of 80 units of housing in one site of these two hpd scenarios, that is, that will inevitably lead to enough zoning. Basically doubling the number of units possible in the current zoning, which is r6b, they're middle of the block, and both sites are either adjacent to or they're adjacent to, the historic district, among other things. So I guess I would ask how the how these sites got dedicated to be developed in this way. To begin with, I mean what was there a community process that shows the hpd sites for development? If the goal is to have those 80 units? Could other sites be identified instead of just putting it all into one spot already close to where there's a lot of density already? So that's two questions I can. I can clarify them if you need, if need be, tasha, unmute yourself and peter. What's the house number and street name for which for the hpd lots I could. I can send the block and lot numbers to pri, probably before the end of the call, but I could I'm going to have house number and street name will do for now. I think off hand. I don't I don't want to hazard the street, the house numbers. I can tell you it's dean between carlton and sixth and it's bergen between sixth and carlton as well, and we can view the block and lots we can give you the house numbers that would have been great okay but yeah. We have run through this before apple, so we well. Forgive me it's your question. I just wanted a little bit more specificity for the purposes of this discussion, put them into chat later. Okay, I think I have it in the office. I have the addresses in the office. Okay, so peter you did make a statement about no penalties. What were you referring to? I was I was referring to an atlantic arts development agreement. There's only the only obligation is for the in terms of completing the project and with penalties is the affordable housing, so affordable housing is complete. The developer doesn't need to continue necessarily they lose. They make control of the development, but there are no financial penalties or anything else associated with not completing the site and the most expensive area. By far is the area between carlton and vanderbilt and Pacific. That's an area where they they've even conceded that they will need to shut down railroad tracks in order to develop it. Okay, peter I'm sorry, this one's counter to my understanding that if you complete certain numbers of dwelling units by 2025, they start running a 1.3 million a month liquidated that's only for the affordable housing, and so once they move there's six thousand. I think 300 units of housing in total in atlantic yards and the housing for 100 250 roughly and those a little less than half are complete already, so they can actually complete the affordable housing in the next three buildings about which would leave as many between three and four buildings not completed and again, the most expensive area. To be completed is the area where the open space is which, for those of you guys who follow development, probably isn't a big surprise. So keep that in mind? Yes, we will and we can pull the same thing the state did before, which is declare it a a disaster zone and the city can take it, but we can go into that. I'm sorry, ms young, would you like to can respond to mr crassus? Please sure I mean you know I could I could try. I could try right, but I think the requirement for open space is something that I really have to bring back to the majority leader and you know talk with our land use department and see you know what, where the opportunities are, and I'm not sure that I'm exactly understanding everything that you're saying, but it's something that I would have to bring back to her and get back to you peter and then with bergen and dean, and the proposal is also something that again with this. With this issue with open space and the up zone, I just have to bring back. The best thing I could do is bring back the concerns the community has to the majority leader before I could respond. I really it would really be premature and unfair for me to try to answer that question before I bring that question back to her. This is an information gathering session right rather than a policy setting or action planning session for the majority leader staff is action planning for us as community board members, and we should take note and make note of plans that we feel as a group that we can execute once we can come to a agreement on this. One of our main action planners is going to be late to the meeting. He did notify me, but he plans to join us. Ms weatherspoon, are there other questions? Oh, they are none. Okay, then. I would ask mr barack to add to what we have seen already as recommendations over public movements in this neighborhood rezoning, mr bear rock sure so where it was just talked about the hbd sites. It is immediately abutting the playground across from 1000 dean. So and yes, it's zoned our 60. So if one cannot achieve the number of units that were suggested, it would require rezoning. The other thing is the way the city acquired the land. It still would probably require a euler to dispose of the property for housing purposes, so either way it. I see this as something that's going to be a euler item. So it's not a quick item and you know, certainly in the context of the crown. This is fine to be part right. Certainly, there are examples in other communities where schoolyards are also called jointly operated, playgrounds, which means after hours, the parks department has interest in them, and so that could become a consideration and there's been a movement to modify the asphalt surfaces to bring in the newer versions of the artificial turf, so that could help modify the type of activities there and if any place is appropriate to try to get more hours out of spaces embellishing with lighting to you know, when you can't easily make more land, if you can make more hours and lighting certain times a year can be part of that solution. Other open realm improvements that the borough president has been pushing in a piecemeal basis through the ulurps when we have private sites, but can certainly be done in the context of city initiatives from downtown Brooklyn. Actually, a bunch of the crosswalks in downtown and surrounding areas extend into the parking lane as a safety measure, to make the actual time of pedestrians in front of traffic lanes that much less. So that's something that could be considered whether there are explicit intersections. That would be deemed a good idea. Sometimes it's done where the sidewalk literally extends out other times. It's done at a lower budget, especially when utilities are there where you'll see the city. D.O.T uses this specialized surfacing like a green rock painted surface and they'll put in these plastic bollards sticking up to cue drivers that there's a space they're not supposed to be in, and that version requires a maintenance agreement with the property owner when DOT moves ahead with that, and that's sometimes done as a trial run instead of making it as permanent commitment. Other things that we've pushed for borough presidents push for within the public realm. A way of absorbing the rain water in a green water philosophy, tep came up with where at one time was called bioswales. Now the ep is calling it rain gardens so looking at property front stitches where the community might rather see sometimes within the road beds, sometimes within the sidewalk area, where the sidewalks wide enough to advance these grain gardens into the public realm as an improvement. So those are a couple of things and then just because you may have areas where you have roadway widths, which could go on a diet without adversely affecting car flow. There's a couple of things in addition to the slide that tasha showed where the triangular park could grow into the street. You have a lot of wider streets that are your narrow streets and a lot of communities. They're only 50 60 feet wide. You have a lot of that are 70 and there are unique situations where they're wider. So the board has seen bike lanes added on a bunch of those streets, especially the east-west streets, but there are many more east-west streets there that don't need to be main traffic flow like you're having or south streets, except for buffalo, that's interrupted by the public housing. So should more bike lanes be proposed in other corridors, but the other thing that's in this community is diagonal parking. Would it make sense to have some streets become diagonal parking as a way to slow the cars down and yet create more supply before of well parking or street is affordable so, especially as more density comes into neighborhood and smaller housing developments are not required to provide parking. The affordable housing now in the transit zone which are in does not require housing to provide parking so over time with the demand for provided parking garages get exceeded by additional cars coming into the area and possibly introduction of car sharing, whether it be curbside car sharing to try to have more universal car ownership, so car sharing, whether it be diagonal parking, whether it be curbside parking. That's something to think about. Do you want to integrate more city bike docks which do you take away from parking? But if you introduce diagonal park you may offset it and then there are places that you have open spaces like howard park, happens to have diagonal parking on one side. If that parking were adequately accommodated parking elsewhere, could you bring the park further into the street? I could creatively find additional space, so just some ideas to think about. Thank you. Are there any more questions? Yes, peter has a question. I'm sorry, I sent a chat. I was asking what we should be anticipating in terms of the schedule for m crown and euler moving forward. Well, I would ask director winston von engel from dcp, I believe, he's on the and on the meeting to respond to that hi everyone good evening. So in terms of the m crown rezoning, I don't think it. It will come as a surprise that obviously this year has been a tremendous just a devastating year. We've all had to make changes, and that means our agency. Also every one of us is working from home. We've had to reassess all of our priorities in terms of our work, our schedules and, at this time we're simply not able to complete a rezoning as hoped for within the time frame of this administration, but that does not mean that we cannot do planning work with all of you and we are intently listening to the comments and reactions here. The thoughtful work that tasha young provided to you all and that you're reacting to, and we look forward to working with you throughout the next weeks months and year to make that to turn your ideas into a plan that can then be implemented when there is more time there and we have the the means to implement it. Thank you winston means is the is the critical element in trying to move this neighborhood rezoning forward and it touches on who's going to pay for the work that has to be done to say that it's safe and proper, whatever else to change from what we have now with more than 50 years of chemicals in the soil to go to residential use and so on and so forth. All of that work who's going to pay for that, but should we consider supporting private applications as council member rep tasha young asked in the questions for the next step, and it's something that one of the main proponents of this app this rezoning has been asking over time. Mr gabriconi is now on the line and I'd like to ask him to speak to that issue. I think that I've been pretty open that we should wait. We should ask property owners to wait so that we do a a thorough review of what needs to happen there to get most the most benefit out of any rezoning. That's done as far as infrastructure planning and eight different agencies budgeting for the infrastructure changes that would be needed to get the most out of the limb, but I want to I want to hear from gab, because we didn't hear from him on monday. He was away having a good time and now he's back. So I want to hear from him hi good evening. Everyone can everyone hear me, I hope so I apologize for coming late. I actually am coming to you just having gotten out of back country for four days, and so I'm not camera ready, and I am not running video, so I apologize. I think that the you know, one of the key questions is: how much can we get done while this administration is in office and you know, can we demonstrate that we have a public process that is moving forward in some way, and I guess in that in that vein, what I would ask is, I think, a good. I think a good indicator of that would be able to would be to be able to get to a scoping hearing, even if you know we're not able to move into euler if we can, if we can come up with and get to the point where we've created a scope for the euler process, we've gotten public input on the scope. I think that would that would demonstrate momentum and would make it more likely that the next administration would continue to pursue this effort as a neighborhood rezoning, and I would ask winston if that might be a reasonable goal to take on together. I would say what we've heard from all of you are a lot of questions and a rezoning should not be taken very lightly. It means significant changes and I think we need. What we would like to do is to use the time that we now have to work with all of you to explore the issues. The questions that you have raised to bring in agencies to answer your questions, to react to your ideas, to your concerns and to first come up with a plan. I think that's the best that we can do within this very narrow time frame. So if I may just to rationalize that, in terms of the timeline we were discussing before you know, we were looking at getting to a scoping hearing sometime, perhaps in the fall. When do you see that falling now winston? I can't tell you honestly. I don't believe that it's possible to do that within this administration. We've simply in terms of the time that it takes to develop this work and the resources necessary that we are not able to go that far in this short period of time. But aren't we talking about a year and five months from now until the next administration we're just talking about a draft scope at this point not beyond? That is that even that is out of reach. Now again, it requires significant resources that we no longer have right. The city has gone through a significant economic contraction in the past few weeks and months, and all of our budgets of the city agencies have been reduced significantly and our ability to do work like this has been reduced right. So to do. A scoping meeting requires the hiring of environmental consultants and we simply do not have a budget for the hiring of environmental consultants, and it's not a trifle. How much are we talking about environmental consultants for in an environmental impact statement, run in the millions right now we're not talking about the whole eis just doing just developing a scope yeah, but in order to do that, there is actually a lot of work that goes into what is the scope right? So, for those who don't know what scope is most of you do, but scope is the kind of work, the scope of work that will go into an environmental impact statement and in order before you even get there, you have to do an environmental analysis to understand whether or not you're triggering any thresholds any impact for potential for impacts. So that means you do have to do a relatively complete environmental analysis in order to understand what impacts you might trigger, but might be as a result of the rezoning in order to then prepare a scope of work where the eis will then further look into those impacts right, and so that is a lot of work that is includes, and sadly, most of it. Much of it is really about traffic and people driving and having cars and using those it affects traffic and air quality and noise all as a result of cars, as well as open space and schools and sewers and water, and all the other aspects of the that go into the environmental review. So it's not a very simple thing to just put together a scope of work. Ms tyus or miss george, I just wanted to see if you might be able to make me present her here, I'd like to just put up the timeline that was presented at the april 23rd m crown meeting just so we can get a sense of where we are what what's reasonable to do now, based on the tasks that were presented in that in that timeline. Okay, give me a second one. Second, thank you. Okay, I'm glad I'm glad that's coming forward. I think it'll help us all winston if we can find a way to piecemeal this thing so that we get some portions completed rather than saying we're going to show the entire until we have the entire million and a half two million dollars to do the work in a bundle if we could again, if I may, I think the strength and the power of this plan that you we are working together is the support that you and all of the other panelists here can give it during this process right, and that is best done when we are able to walk you through. Have you know together talk with other city agencies, answer your questions, respond to your concerns and address them to the best way possible so that you can then we can then together, put together a client, okay, just a second. The community boards will be looking at upcoming budgeting. So if we could get from your office, budget ranges for the parts that gibb is about to walk through. We can approach the agencies individually and parcel it out. Go ahead again, please! Well, I just wanted to bring this up just so we could understand kind of what was laid out a few months ago and then see where we are now and not in so. First question is: when we look at these timelines, where are we now hi gibb? This is jonah. I just want to clarify so where we are now is in the public outreach phase. When we drafted this timeline first, it was meant to be somewhat conceptual. There are a lot of pieces like and steps along the way we really- and it was also quite ambitious, and so we wanted to just be aware of different different steps. I think, before even to get to scoping, we had thought of a number of outreach steps, such as going over capital planning and infrastructure planning talking about housing and other topics that members of the committee raised. I think that process you know takes quite a bit of time and leads up to discussing zoning and land use. So I just want to clarify that you know we. I think we see a lot of opportunity to continue the engagement and dive into some of these topics more in depth. Scoping is a more advanced piece of the proposal. Okay, I understand that, but let's so I'm good with this top time frame. I think we understand that we're talking about ongoing public engagement, looking at the tasks that are represented here. Hopefully people see my mouse and webex here now. I want to look at this bottom timeline, though. What about the bottom timeline? So here we have developed neighborhood plan land use application, urban design, zoning capital plan, draft scope of work, draft environmental impact statement. Sorry about that pardon me, so we know that we're. So we just heard we're not doing the eis right. We're not doing the giraffe scope of work. What are these? What are the other tasks here? Are we doing? What can we get done in the in this in the time frame remaining in this administration a year and a half, so I could speak and I'll. Let others on. We have a our full team here as well. I think you know we're looking at not the land use, application itself or the scope, but urban design, zoning capital planning and though- and I just want to say those- are very robust, complicated things that requires back and forth with with agencies a lot of coordination internally within the department. So, even though we can't get to scoping, we can really advance the work and kind of fully lay the groundwork so to speak. But I would say too that we also want to hear from you and what you think is what you and the committee and others feel as a good use of our time and how we can advance this together. Well, from my point of view, I think that I think that doing work that creates the that creates. You know the foundational stuff that's necessary to move these timelines ahead at some point is important, and I also believe that some of these tasks listed under developed neighborhood plan would be important tasks that would yield meaningful information for the rest of the community as well, so, for instance, urban design and zoning, I think, would be very helpful to get into, to the extent that we could that we could create a draft zoning plan, which is something that many of the community members and many of the committee members on this call, I think, have expressed interest in. But what we think I mean what you know. What we think is important, but we've moved from a discussion of what we think is important to kind of a discussion of you know now we're resource boxed, and so we kind of have to rely on you guys to say look. What is it that we can do? But let me just ask I mean: let me just ask that as a you know, as a deliverable can we can we get to the point where we, where you all, can propose a draft zoning? I would say that, yes, we can work towards that goal. We absolutely can work towards that goal right. That would be the idea that we continue to work together and and develop a zoning proposal together when no now I want to be- I I'm not trying to put you on the spot, winston, I'm really not, but I think in this environment we also want to unders, and we want our group of stakeholders to understand what they can expect to see. You know in as real real progress in within the next year and a half so working towards. Yes, I'm sure we can work towards it, but can we actually deliver it in a year and a half? Is that a commitment you all can make? I think it's possible yeah right, I mean again we're I mean again we're talking about putting together something a plan, and that obviously is based upon an understanding of what the community would like to see happen here and then how to accomplish it and is absolutely right. I mean we're talking about the need, the desire to create affordable housing that requires changes in the zoning. There is no, there is no requirement right now in any of the zoning, not in any excuse me, but there is no requirement in many of the areas of this community district of for affordable housing to be included in new development right, and so that's something that we can work on like where indian crown area. Where should what should the zoning be? And well I mean, let me just be real. Let me just be specific, though we already have kind of a framework. You know that the community board has adopted, and so what we're talking about now is taking that to the next step and proposing zoning around it, and that I guess I'm saying that's something. That's that I think many of the committee members have expressed an interest in seeing and is kind of the logical next step. Is that a reasonable thing for us to do in the next year and a half? Yes, I think in the next year and a half sure yeah okay, I just want to go one record that what I said on tuesday, I think it was about making everything. R2 was a joke. We all know that right, okay, just want to be clear, go ahead, I'm sorry, okay, so I think that I mean I think that would be an important goal for us. That's probably on this on this second line here, while we're working on while we're working on public engagement and engaging with agencies, I think that putting together the draft zoning is an important activity for us, and I I'm only speaking for myself, but it seems like something we should consider focusing on at this stage. I agree with you again: should we put this to a vote? Well, I think it's I mean it's most. If it's, if it's something that the city planning team is able to, you know is able to commit to. I right, but I would give. I think if I may give. I think a zoning proposal is, I would argue, is part and parcel of a larger plan, and part of a larger plan is having is also is a is a housing plan. It's also thinking about open space and addressing urban design and and street and street improvements, pedestrian improvements, those kinds of things. I think we consider those part and parcel just as important as a zoning proposal, and I so they go hand in hand, and I we would like to see you all understand what the city's tools are and how they can be implemented alongside a zoning avery zoning and to make sure that there is a comfort level here in the community for changes in the zoning. I think that's how would you assess that winston we've been over these concepts a number of times over the past year, and I think the members of this audience are familiar now with what the community wants and I, at the one hand, I hear you agreeing that we can do a draft zoning plan, but then a moment later, I'm reluctant to ask you for a revision to this improm draft process and timeline that gives up so that we can see and looking for a memorialization about understanding when and where this project is going. How, when and how this project is going to proceed. So I don't, I don't want to bite you in, but no you're, not boxing us in look just on this call right. We heard concerns about rezoning, increasing density, about density. Right and previously we heard questions, and I don't that those are reasonable questions and concerns, and we've also heard questions about the population change that has taken place or is taking place in this part of Brooklyn and throughout Brooklyn and the city. And you know those are things that I that we believe we are looking into further into those questions that you've raised and you deserve answers to, and I would say that there is a you know before we can go forward and there is a level of comfort on everyone's part. I think there ought to be at least these issues discussed. There may not be agreement, but there should be a full discussion so that you all understand the implications. I think over hearing fear from a fear of unbridled increased density as potential private applicants point at Pacific atlantic arts Pacific park and say they want to harmonize their proposed developments with that, and this is another reason why I believe, we've documented that this community board will not support private applications in general. So the concerns that you're voicing about that you're hearing from members of this audience about increased density is because they have not fully joined in the community board's resistance to in private applications, which is something that we will be memorializing at our full board meeting, either in september or october, so that there is no question that would retard the progress of this neighborhood rezoning in the in the in the eyes of dcp that we're not sure about what we want. No, I I'm dude. If I could, I jump in for a second alex summer. For those who don't know me, I think what we're saying is that we're committed to working on developing the zoning and the urban design framework and all of the associated kind of policies that we can. We can develop without conducting an environmental analysis at this time. I think what winston's referring to is that there has to be an ongoing dialogue about what ultimately, the zoning districts would be, and I think we're we don't want to just say: here's the zoning. What do you guys think we want to talk through all of the different implications about the different densities, the different heights, different ways that we can modify our zoning regulations to accommodate local and unique conditions, and that and that yeah, I'm sorry go ahead. Mrs tyson, I like I like that. That's new, I didn't know you. This is new and so like that it requires like an ongoing dialogue, and I think why we're a little hesitant to say it's going to take x number of months is because we're in a new environment of technology- and we haven't tried out all the different methods of public engagement with this new reality and with these new considerations, and so like I said what you're hearing from us is we're committed to continuing our planning work with you and everybody on the call. It's just we don't know what that looks like and what jonah was saying earlier is. I think we really want to hear from you about how to engage in that dialogue so that it's not just a series of letters back and forth, but it's really meaningful conversations about when we go from one zoning district to another zoning district, we're actually talking about how many apartments, how many families and what that means- and that's really what we want to have that dialogue for, but if I, if I may, this is gibb, I don't want to minimize either what we're going through with the Covid-19 emergency or what it's meant for the city budget I mean both of those are very serious things. I want to point out that the plan that we're looking at on the screen right now was presented. You know a month and a half into the Covid-19 emergency. Now, obviously, things have developed since then, but I mean at this point: we knew that we were doing some of these activities virtually you know. So, let's not. Let's just understand that we didn't. We didn't do this in a vac in a complete vacuum and things have changed and we need to just simply adjust what our plan is and I'm I some of the discussion we're having here makes it sound like something has prompted us to. You know: go back to an earlier stage in the process than and really can I that I think can be rationalized. We already have a zoning framework. The zoning framework has indicative densities in it. We've already done bulk analysis. We have a feel for how many apartments are going to be created and how many of those apartments will be affordable apartments. So I don't think it's. I don't think it's helpful to give other folks on the call, the idea that somehow you know maybe people who are not as familiar with all of these things in detail. I get to have them, get the idea that this work somehow hasn't been started. Yet it's actually quite far along. I think what we need really simply is just a new plan, a new work plan, and if and if the work plan is developing, the neighborhood plan, as winston and alex and jonah have explained it, then let's lay that out and let's look at that as an objective. I don't. I think, that there's lots of value in all of that, and alongside of that, just as this, just as this timeline indicates we'll be able to continue to do public outreach in the process. But so I don't I don't. I don't see any of this as being incompatible at all. I don't think any part of what we put together has been you know, has been negated or needs to be. You know needs to be reconsidered. I just think we need to modify what our goals and what our plan is on the basis of resources, and we- and I would just ask you- know winston and alex and jonah if you are, if you're able to sort of recast this plan in terms of what we now know about resources. Let's do that and let's just see where we are and let's keep moving forward. Excuse me. Excuse me this is irisa. I just want to just have it known that we have two people that are waiting for a while now to ask a question, so I just desmond will be first and sarah will be next just to so we can get everyone. You know that wants to speak to have the opportunity. Thank you desmond unmute yourself. Can you un mute yourself desmond you have to unmute yourself, miss george. Can you unmute him? I cannot. I have to get the ball back from give I'm trying to do that. Okay, oh sorry, about that. Did that help. I don't see what else I can do to change it. I think we need to switch from webex to ms microsoft teams. I heard that I don't seem to be the host anymore. No, it looks like mr atkins is unmuted now good there. He is hi, sir desmond go ahead. Hello desmond doesn't mean your computer needs to be using webex for audio jasmine okay. So who else is next sarah, while we're waiting on desmond? Why don't you ask your question? Okay, awesome! Thank you. We can hear you okay, yeah now, okay, I'm really just trying to follow this as someone who's kind of new to the landis processes and euler processes, and trying to learn and catch up. But I guess from what I'm understanding is that you know obviously the city's it's the city budget that is vastly diminished because of the crisis, and so it's the environmental impact statement that is the most expensive thing to produce, and so that's the piece that is forcing all of this to be delayed, but some of the other things are less expensive, like the urban design and capital planning etc. And I guess I'm wondering like I guess I understand if something very big, like the environmental impact statement needs to be delayed. Does that mean that the things on the other timeline keep going like the community engagement meetings and things like that and then I also just had another total newbie question. I don't fully understand what capital planning is. I don't know if there's like a 30-second explanation of it for us newbies, maybe I'll. I could take a stop. I think those are great questions, and so absolutely we want to work on the community engagement. There's a formal engagement process related to euler, but for neighborhood planning. We do much earlier engagement and part of that is just relates to capital planning as well, but I would say that so maybe I'll answer this your question in two parts, so first capital planning is based on whenever we're considering growth in a larger area, we're looking at a whole assortment of projects that support that growth and also the surrounding community. So it's looking at everything from parks open space streets sewers. So we often describe that as public realm, but it's kind of a much broader umbrella of infrastructure and also of priorities that we hear from from the community, and then I guess the reason I'm answering that first is because that relates back to the community engagement, in that we so for the environmental review that requires consultant work. That is very, very expensive, as we mentioned, but within the department of city planning, we have a lot of existing resources and then you can also tap into our colleagues from other agencies and that those are just using the staff that we already have and the team that we already have, many of whom are on the call today and that that's work that we can do within the existing budget. But the environmental review really requires an expensive, eis and consultant work that, unfortunately, we just don't have at this time. Does that answer your question? I'm sorry that was a little. Those are great questions by the way, but they're very interesting, I'm a student who's trying to just yeah. I think those answer the questions I mean for one thing, I had no idea the environmental impact statements were not produced by the city themselves, so I learned something I didn't realize that it was that outside consultants were the people who do that kind of thing, just a quick clarification they are produced by us, but it's we rely on consultants to perform a lot of the analysis so for for air. I'm sorry boots on the ground kind of thing: go ahead, yeah! It's! I think environmental review warrants its own conversation, but a lot of the cost and resources are done by consultants. Okay is desmond anything else. Sarah on there desmond if you're ready. Please ask your question: I can't get him, I don't know what happened. I see him he's still there. He said he was trying to unmute himself, but I unmuted him. So I don't understand why I hope to hello. I spoke to desmond. He said that he kept talking and talking, but we I told him we were not hearing him. I suggested that he sent his question via chat and he said that he was trying to do that also, but it seems like he's having some technical difficulties. I have a question. His question is: can winston delineate the exact steps that are within the scope? Basically a flow chart and a rough range of dollar figures involved within each step of the scope? This way you can plan for a future action plan. I'm thinking how about how to answer the question, I would say we're can if I may step back the we're getting ahead of ourselves. We you know we still need to do a lot of of have a lot of a planning work ahead of us before we can even start the environmental work. I think we want you to sign on to the zoning proposal and to embrace it so that we can actually, then in in good conscience, ask for the amount of money that it takes to do a full environmental impact statement. But in terms of the I mean in fairness, because this member of the this committee is not able to fully explain the question but an enviro, any any land use change requires some form of environmental review and the more significant the change is, the more involved and intense the environmental review is. There is a document, a technical manual that spells out exactly how environmental reviews are to be conducted, and in that technical manual there are charts in which you can imagine for a small zoning change, a small increment or change in the land use. Not much review is needed, but for one as it gets larger there are certain thresholds milestones reached, at which point a more intense review is required right. So a scope of work. Sorry there are about. I think, if I'm not right about 23 separate categories in to be considered for environmental review, and I listed some of them a little bit earlier, and so the first thing that you do for any zoning change is when you conduct an environment review whoever it is. You go through each category and you see whether or not you are exceeding the threshold for your proposal and if it is a small change right, then you're going to be below the thresholds. But as you get larger, it's a larger rezoning. You will reach the threshold. There are automatic triggers right, you're introducing x amount of square feet of commercial space or more a certain amount of housing, and that will and that it has the potential it doesn't say it does, but the potential to have an impact, and so that then it's almost like up this one, and then you put it aside and says: okay that one needs to be studied, and from that you develop a scope of work. You we will be studying traffic, because we expect this many cars. We will be studying schools, because we expect this many, this much this much housing which triggers this many likely this many people which who would likely have this many children who will then send their kids to schools and the schools are at this capacity, so likely need to study school and maybe have an impact on schools, maybe have an impact on air quality, maybe have an impact on open space that is considered each one of those go into the scope of work. That then, is discussed publicly right. The public gets to review it. Did we catch everything that we're supposed to study for this? So if we miss an intersection, if we miss a playground, did we miss a a development site? Did we forget about anything and that then, once that is completed, then the scr? Then they it's like a work program for consultants to then continue and to actually look into this much further and to then write out an environmental impact statement, and that is what a scope of work is and in terms of cost, they literally go into the millions. If I could just maybe make a suggestion and maybe get us a little bit out of what I think is you know a very detailed explanation of what the process is and just bring it back up to what I'm hearing, which is really a concern about something tangible to hold on to with this relationship between all parties. On this call- and you know at one point- there was a timeline- and you know that is in question: it's not going to go before the majority leader, so even you know to add those questions about a memorable understanding. I think what I'm hearing that the community is saying is you know what tangible commitment? Besides, we will work with you and we will hear you out what are some benchmarks that we can maybe put in place. What is something that the community could walk away with confidently, knowing that this is the process that we're going to go through with benchmarks that will be met and committed to by the city agencies. Maybe when are we going to talk to other city agencies? You know that I just I just I'm getting a sense that this, like ambiguity, is like making people. You know not feel very confident in what this process is going to look like it's too much. It's too much uncertainty, even for me on this call, it's like well, you know. When is it and what is it and how are we going to do it and without those questions really being answered in a way that satisfies the community board, we're going to keep kind of going through these? What feels like platitudes that you know can change you know, because there's no feeling of a real commitment to certain benchmarks did I did I? How did I do good yeah? I I'd like to say I share tasha's concerns and I and I and she could have taken the words out of my mouth and I think that there's an opportunity to address them by simply updating the plan that was presented back in april. I think we just have to look at where we are now in terms of time and resources and provide a plan with specific milestones and tasks, as tasha mentioned. So everyone understands what we're talking about, and I and I one of the things I liked about the plan that was presented before is we had separate tracks there for outreach, and you know the traditional planning tasks that winston was describing and we can do those things in parallel. I don't think we should you know we. I wouldn't want to give the impression that we're conflating them somehow. So I'd like to ask again winston, if it is, can you can you provide an updated plan based on based on your current, your current available resources, and you know what we have been discussing in the spring yeah sure I hear I think tasha. I agree with tasha. I think, with what you're grasping for is like give us something tangible and, as I was listening to what tasha was saying, and of course what you were saying as well gib is that look. You know we met with you several. It was now I think, almost two months ago, or so the last time right and then right. We were we paused right and we paused, because we were told stop things have changed dramatically in the city and we need to reconsider and we're back now and we're we something conditions obviously have changed, but our interest and our commitment to work with you on putting together a plan have not the. What has changed is the schedule in terms of deliverables. It is, it is obviously drawn out, and we want to be take advantage of that more expanded time frame that we have for outreach to really get it right to and you we would like to come back to you with hpd. We would like to come back to you with more information about the demographic changes. We would like to come back to you with other agencies like d.o.t and parks, and but we need to you know we need to start and we're ready to start or to continue that work with you. You know this was intended to be an update meeting and I think the next meeting with you should be where we we can tell you when and where we can meet with the next city agency and whatever information you want, I can, and but winston can I ask beyond just what the immediate next step is. Can you actually just give us an updated plan, a time and event schedule that looks like what was presented in april? That's been, you know, that's been recast in light of current resources. Can that can that happen? Let's say maybe at our at our september meeting that will be for october again. Okay, can that happen at our october meeting to do what to like deliverables or something like that? Like yeah a few minutes ago, I had shown a slide from the april 23rd presentation. Can we get? Can we get something with maybe slightly more detail than that, but basically covering those same two timelines showing what we can now expect to be able to accomplish between now and the end of 2021., I'm struggling because I I'm honestly, I think we can certainly come back to you. I don't. I actually would prefer that we need to talk with you. We need to discuss with you about what it is. What other information that it actually is to, actually that you that you should know about right. I think we want to talk to you like wait. Let me ask a question, though, is this new did something that was because none of this was a factor on april 23rd, when this other did something happen that changed the information you need from us that didn't exist at the time that we discussed the previous schedule. I think the previous schedule was based on a at that time, a rational presumption that we had resources available to do environmental review and that we had the time available and other means available to get this project done by the end of the administration, and that is simply no longer true right, but we got that. I totally understand that what I'm saying now is: let's recast that schedule, given the resources have changed. What I'm thinking I heard you say was we need more information and I'm not clear as why you why you need more information before we recast the schedule with current resources. Well, I think what do you mean we need more? When did I say that we need more information, more information from you or more information from agencies? What I asked was, can we can we present a new schedule, so everyone will know what we can accomplish, what we expect to be able to accomplish during the term at the remaining term of the administration at our october meeting and what I thought I thought I heard you say was yes, but we need more information from you, and so I just want to understand what that information is yes, so it is your interest in in what it is that you want to learn about right when we, when we were when we were speaking when we were meeting earlier this year right, we presented you with information about the demographic change in the community and legitimate questions were raised about. What does that mean? What is what is the effect on housing and what we suggested is that it might. It would be good for you to hear from our housing agency from hpd about the programs that they have and the and the methods and tools that they have to increase the amount of affordable housing in the city, and here in crown heights all right. We also heard I'm sorry, but I want to go. I want to go back to what tasha said. We can't I really I'm frustrated that it sounds like we're going to go around. It's everything. You're saying is fine, but none of that should exclude our ability to come back with a new schedule. At this point, I don't understand that we had a schedule. We, the only assumption that has changed between then and now is resources and we should be able to recast it. Now. I'm glad you mentioned the presentation on demographics, because one of the things we suggested at the time that meeting took place with the steering committee and dcp, and we suggested that presentation, or at least a summary of it, be made to this committee. I is there any reason why we can't do that now. Can we do that at the september meeting or any meeting, I mean I'm sorry to sound frustrated, but no by all means. Yes, absolutely, and I think that's what we and you missed the meeting on tuesday right. We talked about coming back to you all, with follow-ups to that. Yes, by all means, so no I mean in terms of a schedule right there is that you wanted more. You wanted to present to the steer to the, not the steering committee. Excuse me to the subcommittee about demographics happy to do that right. You also had questions about hpd about housing programs. We can absolutely do that and come back to you with hpd in the next few months. We are happy to talk with. I think it's we want to do this in concert with you. We can draw up a schedule right. We can say, put a plan to put a plan together by the end of this administration, okay right, but what is it that goes between now? What goes inside the schedule between now the end and the end of the administration, and that's the thing that we wanted to hear from you. We have some ideas right. We mentioned demographics. We mentioned hbd parks, housing, sorry d.o.t, but we want to hear from you what else is there? We would love to discuss with you once it's completed, show you a zoning proposal and discuss it with you and make changes to it as necessary so that we can put this all together, but we need to hear from you what it is that it is that you are interested in learning more. What other questions do you have? What else do you need? Okay? Let me wait. I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, winston! You mentioned 23 categories of review for thresholds that automatically trigger different the next steps, and I believe you were referring to the city's environmental followers quality review manual. Am I correct? Yes, okay, so that is available online and we will be looking at that, but the answers that I'm hearing now a plan to be made available by the end of this administration is not what gibb is asking give is asking for a plan now for what we can do between now and the end of the administration and your response was you'll, have a plan by the end of this administration on how to move forward by the end of this administration. That's not what we're asking and tasha's comments were right on point, so we need to close this gap of vagaries, and even if the plan is skeletal, it should be from now to the end of this administration. We don't know who the next mayor's going to be, but that's what we're asking you for yeah. I really think we have to focus on an update to what was previous to the timeline that was presented in april 23.. I understand what you're saying winston, but I I'm gonna push back on any suggestion that somehow we need to rethink that. Something has happened that caused us to rethink any assumptions on april 23rd other than resources. I don't see that. Let me tell you why I'm being so insistent about this, it's because, right now, the community board has taken a position that we don't want to support private euler applications and that's an exceedingly strong position and if we don't have a plan that shows how we're going to deliver something meaningful. That shows a public process that can extend into the next administration we're going to have a very difficult time. Defending that- and I need you to understand that and help us on it. If I can okay, I I'm I hear you I you know, we did not suggest that you not review or consider that is the community board's prerogative to do about private applications. I would we can it and I would disagree with you. Gabe. A lot has changed in the past four months in a sin since april, and today in april, we as a city we weren't, yet as aware of the significant changes that Covid-19 would bring to us, and so let me go back to a tangible something tangible right. We have, in the past, worked on projects that are then at the end of administrations that have then gone on to the next administration that the next administration has then proceeded to implement, and there are- and I think I gave you all some examples previously- you know- east new york was a project that our agency worked on in the bloomberg administration, with a grant from the obama administration right that the de Blasio administration took on and said, let's implement this, if you will planning for downtown Brooklyn started under the giuliani administration planning for greenpoint and williamsburg started under the giuliani administration. These are all ideas and and visions that were developed in one administration and then executed in the next administration and in part it was done because the resources, the timing, wasn't there to complete the work within that administration and partly because you know, there's thought that there would be more political support for this or there wasn't or there wasn't any financial support for it at the time right. So that's why we're suggesting that we that we, you know, let's work until the event of this administration. Let's work together to put together a great plan that then can be presented to the next council member to the next mayor, where this community can say we stand behind us and we would like for you now to implement this, and the value of the power of that plan is vested in the amount of community buy-in and that's the part that we really want to work on with. You is to make sure that all of your questions are answered that you're comfortable- and we see this in as much as this delay is inadvertent. We see it also as an opportunity to work with you to be more thorough, okay, but I just I want to make sure that it's I because I really would not want any of any of the committee members to begin to be confused about this, and I don't think they are, but I want to make sure it's understood. The community board has not changed its objectives for the m crown plan. The community board has not changed its adoption of the framework that dcp presented the community board. I mean we're regardless of what's transpired in conversations here. There's a tremendous amount of interest in this subject, but there is no change in the objectives for this part of community district 8., and I think that I don't- and I haven't heard anything quite frankly that makes me think that any other assumptions from the spring has changed other than resources due to covenant or due to the fallout from Covid-19 19, which is totally legitimate. No, but nobody, I don't think here, I don't think anyone does not understand the stress. The city is in right now and understands the resource constraints. That's absolutely legitimate. Our challenge now is: how do how are we moving forward and are we? Are we, as a community board? Are we moving forward on the same basis that we last communicated to our stakeholders and I think in that world, to the extent that we see progress being made according to those objectives? We have a good message to deliver to that. If we, if we if it sounds like, I would really caution us not just not to give the impression there are goals or objectives that are somehow being reconsidered here. That is not what is taking place. You're good- and I didn't say that, but you but I right, but you asked good legitimate questions about the demographic change in the community right and we have actually done some more research into it right and are looking into and have gotten more information more background to it that we can share with you right. We also in this schedule that we showed you that you had put up right. The amount of interaction of a feedback loop is would have been really minimal, right, we're hoping that we can actually show you a zoning proposal and discuss it with you and give it the amount of time that it actually deserves to for you to understand it for us to make potential changes to it and then right to have it presented publicly. That all sounds good. I think we're all I mean we're right. This is one of the things that's challenging for me in this discussion, because I don't think we have any misalignment in that objective. We're simply we're simply looking for a way to manage the process through a defined plan. That's based on the plan we've already seen but updated for resources, and we hope that's something that you can share with us at our at our october meeting. Does that sound reasonable? We can certainly talk to you. Let's try and put something together that tries and addresses what it is that you're looking for right, let's try and do that right, I'm putting a link in the chat to the city's environmental technical manual for environmental quality review is that okay, winston? Will that help? Do you think that'll help us get to the educated level? You wanna yeah, I thought sure, but I would I would you know. I would just say that the and environmental review is really the tail of the dog. You want to know right. Imagine what the environmental review would have been for the Brooklyn bridge right, so we're building a bridge. What is likely to happen right, I mean it's like did you want to have the bridge built or you know, if you so? Yes, by all means, it may help people who have questions about environmental review and whether it's all involved, but I would say the strength of a plan- is the substance of it. Not the environmental review, okay so, but you did mention that it would be a 23-step wise process to go. So I want to share that with our attendees here and as I look at the map for the in crown area and surrounding blocks, it's it's be it behooves me to bring forward the fact that part of the map is covering what is currently the crown heights north historic district phases, one one and two and then going west on the map. It includes part of the proposed crown heights historic district phase, four, which was written up in the crown heights west rezoning as a historic resource, and we do have deborah young on the line on the call, as well as irsa with the school who are members of the crown heights. North association, I'm hoping they'll have something to say about the the effects of public realm. Improvements would have on the current and proposed historic district. Miss young or miss westmoon, hello, she's, not she's, I'm mute you have to unmute yourself, mrs weatherspoon, okay. Well, they have ms young had is doesn't want to contribute to that discussion right now, but I just want to point that out as we look at public realm improvements, the map includes current and proposed segments of the crown heights north historic district. So we can move on from there or go back to asking for a updated plan even at the skeletal ms tyus. If I might could I could I move the committee move that the committee request an updated schedule for the for the m crown rezoning be presented by the department of city planning at our october meeting so that it may consider how best to proceed. Is that your motion? It is there a second. Is there a second sorry? Could the motion be repeated? I would like to move the committee request, an updated schedule for the tasks for the m crown rezoning be presented by the department of city planning at the october meeting for the for the purposes of assisting the committee in determining how to proceed. Second, I'm going to call the roll we're going to try to call the roll from the list of panelists that we have I'm not going in alphabetical order, because that's not how I have it. I vote yes, deborah young, yes, desmond atkins, you can vote with raised hand. Maybe this is difficult. Can you raise your hand? Mr atkins? This is difficult. We have to clean this up this weatherspoon. You can unmute yourself or raise your hand. Desmond said yes in the chat princess james, sucking the motion also in the chat they can put their responses in chat, okay, sarah's. The second princess is the second. So far we have yeah you. Are you able to record this miss george, the meeting's being recorded? Yes, okay. So next is all the world best based on the list of participants, not in alphabetical order going into chat, peter crassus all right raise your hand or put it in the chat. We have princess ben james voting by text. Sierra lazul was the second sharon whittleburn there's a question: do we have a quorum or committee members? I believe we do a 23 question. I'm not seeing these questions. The question came in by text. No, it came to me at the host. Okay. Do we have a quorum of committee members? What's the question? Okay, I'm looking at all attendees. We have 23 people four and seven, I'm not able to see it all. So I have to depend on you to answer that question. I'm trying to count them. How many people do we need, but everyone that's on here- are not committee members correct right, so I don't know that answer either 18 at the list in person needed, we had 18 members, so a quorum would be 10. go back. I see that we have 10., okay. Those ten would be me, ms young, mr atkins yourself, ms witherspoon, mr crashes, miss ben james, ms lazur, miss wetterburn, there's someone on here by the name of john. They didn't give a last name. I don't know who john is, but I think I just listed 10 people yeah. If he was a committee member we'd know his last name. Unless he's a new board member, I don't know who john is so. I don't know: okay, 10 members, so that's the quorum. You guys said yes, 18 total with the entire committee. If they all show up for him to do business with the majority of that, so that would be 10. and we were counting you're getting votes by text. I'm not seeing everything here. How many yeses do we have this jordan? One desmond atkins he's the only one? Okay, then I'm too, I think I heard ms young vote. Yes in the roll call. Yes, okay, you're! So ms weatherspoon, I think voted yes as well. Yes, I did gib okay and I voted yes too as princess right. Yes, okay, sarah has her votes. Yes, sarah, okay, she was the second. So we have one two, three, four, five, six seven out of ten the motion passes, so we are asking formally for a presentation of the updated plan for october. I hope that city planning will be able to meet us on that. The question: would it so the presentation from dcp on housing and demographics is that still on the table, I mean I'd be interested in that absolutely I hope so it's up to up to mr engle is that the winston no excellent we're happy to do that, and I really appreciate your question sarah about this. Is you know it's like? Let's get started doing this, we can certainly share with you a plan for how to move forward, how to get to a plan or something by the end of this administration and then have you react to it and say: okay, we want to know more about this and less about that, and we care about this, and then let's do this. Yes, absolutely I'm sorry saying by the end of this administration we're asking for october. I, if I may, I think, I think, when we use the plan, we're using the we're overloading the word plan when winston says plan by the end of the administration, I believe he's talking about a neighborhood plan that includes that includes zoning, that includes urban design and the lobby. What the commit committee board committee just asked for was an updated schedule to get to that right. Yeah. I would like to also say that the presentation that we saw on demographics, that the department of city planning presented was excellent. It had a number of important insights about what's happening in community district 8. That I believe, would influence more than just the more than just the m crown project, and so it would be terrific to have that presentation be given to the land use committee, if not, if not the entire community board. Okay, also desmond atkins has a question. Okay, the question is, I'm not seeing it in the chat. Can someone can is wait for him to ask his question or put it he wants to know if there are any pertinent updates in the 833 manual that might affect our study. The 200 2014 edition. Well, if you leave the website carefully, there's an update there. The update is from 2016, but it's a fair question: does anyone a dcp know if there's anything more recent in 2016 in the secret technical manual? I don't think so. It's maybe but maybe but again I would let on the environmental review side, you you're worrying about if I may, as an analogy, you're worrying about whether or not like what kind of an engine goes in the car when we're trying to travel from point a to point b, right and- and it really is about- I would argue it's about the contents of the planning document it is about. You know, regardless of what the environmental review says is, do you want to see more housing? Do you want to see an expansion improve pedestrian safety projects on atlantic avenue? Do you want to see, and where do you want to see open space improvement parks improvements? What kind of buildings would you like to see what shape what height, what uses do you want to see? Those are important. The environmental review is reactive. It looks at that and says: if you do this, then this is what might occur and you'll take a look at it and you'll say we're. Okay with that, or you might say we're not, but I would say: wait do the planning and then worry about the environmental review. Don't the environment review just tests to see what is the? What might be the effects if you implement this plan and then it's up to you all to decide whether or not you're, okay with that or not right, sounds logical. So I think you know we hear you. Richard wants to apparently speak as well, and I've spoken enough. Mr barrack, can you unmute yourself did, I believe so. I think one of the things that winston brought up is very important in terms of the size of the buildings and things like that. The uses, because you've got right, that there might be a certain number of units that can be developed, and so from that we might have a sense well based on this height, what zoning matches it is that zoning on the books is this, something that has to be somewhat modified. For example, the industrial area. Might it fit into some new zones that were talked about for north Brooklyn and therefore it's not custom, but it's not something you have today, so getting a sense of what heights people are comfortable with on the east west streets on the north south streets, how much retail, how much office? So some of that could start leading to visuals. You know what can be done in house by city planning to show what streets may look like, or can we take cut and paste images of other buildings that are the heights of these opportunities showing which sites might change based on how much zoning change you know, these are exercises that can happen over many months to help inform people right. So, in addition to learning about where you might be able to figure out squeezing out more park space or affordable housing beyond mih, that could be an area where city planning is much more need than its sister agencies. That's good any comments on there folks. Well, this has been very helpful and I apologize to crown heights north board members for not preparing them or asking them for comments in advance, but I hope that this can be examined as we go over the next couple of months and bring it forward because the study area, that's the study area- is going to be affected by what's around it, and I hope we can revisit that in october. We have some time to take a look at it. Is there something else we need to cover tonight? You're, gonna, unmute, yourselves and ask answer ms young tasha young. You have anything we should be preparing for october. Can you unmute yourself, hello, tasha? You want to do any closing statements. I apologize. No, I'm good! Okay. Does anybody want to make a closing comment? Peter? Dare I ask you: are you still there I'm here, but I think we've all had a long meeting? Okay. So unless there's anything else, I would thank you all for coming and we'll reconvene in october, first thursday, whatever that date is, unless we have an lpc item which would take precedent, and we can revisit this discussion in between now and then I hope you will all look at the suggestions that dcp has made winston's been very instructional in helping us understand what they need to do, what we're asking them to do so we have to team up and be prepared to give them the information that they've been asking us for. So unless there's anything else, I'll say good night good night, everyone good night and thank you good night, good night.
