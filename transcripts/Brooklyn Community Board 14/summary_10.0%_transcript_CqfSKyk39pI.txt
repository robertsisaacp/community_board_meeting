Any decision made by the committee of the whole can be enacted immediately and will be ratified retroactively by the full board at our september 14th monthly meeting the matter before the full board today is whether the board wants to endorse a letter written by brooklyn borough president eric adams to mayor bill de blasio, which proposes to include community board input in the hiring of commanding officers of the co-terminus precinct.
Thank you and thank you sean for for coordinating the meeting and thank everyone at cb14, I'm a cb14 resident for all the work that you all do and and for putting together this really thoughtful response to an idea that the borough president has put forward as a way to to really increase community engagement in the in in policing and to provide additional oversight at the at the the most local of policing levels I wanted to to just before I jumped into that.
So I want again thanks thanks to to the entire board and to sean for reaching out and and quite frankly, providing the most thoughtful feedback that we've gotten on this issue thus far, and we're really pleased with a lot of these questions, because I'm going to be completely frank with you up front like we don't have the answers to them.
I, but what the the intent of this idea and this letter to the the mayor and to the commissioner was to create an opportunity or a concept that we can, that we can they're, saying hello, that where we can and get engage community more in police oversight, the this idea sort of stems from this.
This need to to have more local engagement and oversight on policing matters, but it's really a intended to be a beginning of a conversation that a lot of community boards are gonna have to have with with their precincts and with their are you, okay, you're right with their with the with the mayor and the commissioner?
What we're looking to do right now, primarily, is to just engender support for this idea and then even possibly, given the fact that you've outlined a lot of really important questions that need to be answered and that need to be laid out potentially identify a local, a local, a pilot project for something like this and, in speaking with the borough president, it sounded like we would be open to sort of you know, pitching a proposal from the community board about how the formation of the panels is created, how the bylaws of the panel are created and pitching that to the mayor and to the commissioner directly.
What the borough president included in his letter was a a make up a formation of panels that would would be representative of community boards and of precinct community councils.
What we had envisioned was that the the commissioner would would pro would present three qualified candidates based on their existing processes of determining who's qualified to become a precinct commander, and then this committee, this new form this panel, would be able to interview candidates and provide you know, receive additional background information about the candidates and make a decision about who they wanted to represent their community, with the understanding that community boards precinct community councils have the most local knowledge of what communities need and what types of what types of policing they want in their communities and identifying the candidate that best aligns with that with that vision.
We want to have a conversation with with community boards and community members about how we're going to create this sort of panel and and bring that to the mayor and the commissioner to encourage them to participate in this in this process, and then so that would be.
I'm happy to answer any questions that I can, but I'm really thankful again for the opportunity to to speak about this tonight and especially in my home community board and get feedback about this proposal and see if we can get community board 14 support in advancing this in some way, whether that's as a partner, a formal partner in a pilot program proposal or simply as the letter as ed mentioned earlier.
Now, if you you know, if I mean we have a number of questions here, would anyone like to advance any question that we've already included or if you have any additional questions that you might like to ask ryan at this time, steve had a question about whether we reached out to to commissioner shea.
Frankly, at the last meeting, the kinds of input that people are interested about, saying the the command the commander of the precinct has no effect on whether it be whether it be a rogue cop is something that obviously, as you know, is hired by iab or the or the fbi.
You know the community had previous to him being appointed, had reached out to the commissioner and said that we don't want this particular person and as a precinct commander in large part because of his his known history.
I don't have the authority to say what kind of tools would be would be provided, but I do know that, as with the reforms to 50a, that information is going to be more transparent and more accessible to the public, but what I would what I would hope to see in in, and I think what the borough president would hope to see in this project would be for local communities to identify what exactly what the, what could be these panels would identify what they would need in sort of the the the formal form formation of the of the panels.
So what the borough president put in his letter would be the formation of a panel that included representatives from the public safety committees of the relevant community boards and the policing police precinct community councils.
We haven't just gotten to a point where we're discussing training or any of that that that that information yet, like I said we're looking for feedback on on the proposal and then identifying what I mentioned about a pilot project was that you know we we, the letter, was signed by several.
We're looking to you know, push this to the mayor and say: let's work together to identify a format that works with input from from local community boards, so the the letters, the the questions that were put together by cb14 were incredibly helpful for us to think about this and will be incredibly helpful as we're speaking with the mayor about this.
What I mentioned about a pilot project is that, if, if cb14 or another community board wanted to to you know, propose this to be a pilot in their particular district, we would be willing to work with those groups to bring it to the mayor and to the commissioner, because obviously this would be a conversation with the with the administration as well to to develop what what the final product would look like.
You know, and I'm really happy to hear you talking about in instead of the borough president and the office of the borough, president working out all the details of what that involvement would look like you want to involve community boards and sort of crafting that, and you know, co-creating what that might be.
If I heard you correctly, when you first started speaking, I think you said that the borough president had actually he hadn't discussed this with commissioner shea, but he had discussed it with the mayor.
Did I hear you correctly when you said that yeah he spoke with mayor about this, but I couldn't I I'm not 100 certain whether he's spoken with commissioner shea or not, but I believe he is not okay, because I would love if you could share a little bit more about those discussions with the mayor, because I think, if I remember the last meeting correctly, some of the concern was well.
Maybe you can about what those conversations have looked like, and you know the chances of the mayor really buying into this plan, and I would also say just as a general piece of feedback, because so much of the concern is around this lack of clarity, and I really like what I'm hearing from you about a panel or inviting a selection of community board members in that might be something really good to add to the letter.
That's perfectly fine with the borough president, with with myself as well, and if, if that's that's something that is a concern to community board 14 and you still wanted to do a letter, I would encourage you to incorporate that into into the letter for sure, because that would probably earn my endorsement for consideration of a plan further.
So if he has the political will to push something through, then that's what he's going to want to do if, with respect to whether this applies to all boards, I think in the borough president's vision.
If you can lower your hand, sean you had your hand up, but it's down yeah, I kind of wanted to go after everybody just so that I can make sure that I'm kind of summarizing what I, what I think, I'm hearing his answers, so I'm going to keep my hand down unless nobody else puts one up as of right now.
Has everything go ahead, nina yeah, so I have a just a couple things I want to address one I think, given the fact that we're probably well we're like the second most diverse community and community board in the five boroughs, I think that biases prejudices is probably pretty far-fetched.
What this process would do would be to review already identified as qualified candidates, and then you know, provide feedback on what the community thinks that is necessary in a precinct commander.
I don't have a question so much, but I will try to phrase the question if need be, but just wanted to reiterate my support since last time we heard this proposal and thank your office for having some imagination here in terms of how the community works can provide a democratic process into police proceedings.
Some context in class we spoke with 50a was revealed in the state level, which would allow us to have more insight into substantiated and unsubstantiated complaints against police officers who are in the process of becoming police captains, which, I think is a key piece of information that we wouldn't otherwise not have had to joe's point earlier that that he made a couple months ago as well, and tonight that you know we don't have the expertise to be able to help select already identified folks.
You know jonathan, this concern, mr lynch, that you're hearing around accountability and and the community board's perception- and I really respect that concern- and I guess I just want to add my opinion, which is that it would be an honor to have that kind of responsibility and accountability.
But I think that the community board could really hopefully in a different world, help hire some awesome person that created and led a precinct where something like what happened with abner and nemo would never happen.
I think what the brook I know what the president is proposing is to use community board rep members that are already on the mem member, like being members of the public safety committee or whoever the chair would decide to appoint to some other committee.
What I think I'm hearing is that the community board doesn't want to be responsible.
I will jump in now and and thanks for clarifying that that ryan, because that is something that I mean you know board.
So I think the thing that I heard same working for the borough president too, but the concern that I've heard a few times is something that I've actually articulated to a few of you and you know you've called it accountability, some of you.
However cautiously, so you know I I I would like to hear from other board members on this.
My fellow board members have said, and I think that there are still questions.
So I still concur that we need to meet in a different setting with the other community boards that are also interested in this, so that we could really understand where we we are going, and I guess my my question to you is given the time constraints in september is right around the corner is what are the next steps for us?
I also want to bring this back to the borough president, the feedback that you all provided and- and you know, share with him the thoughts that you all had and see if we can impress upon the mayor to potentially convene a conversation, a more in-depth conversation about this, but I could certainly bring that back and report back with respect to what the board does I'll defer to what the board members want to do in terms of next steps in engagement, whether that's a letter or further kind of going further and like being willing to be a quote, unquote, guinea pig for for this idea, it's it's really up to up to to the board.
As far as the the board's next steps, I I think we will need to review this, and- and you know, when we meet in september- that we should continue this discussion among board members.
I that I, because this isn't an activity of the whole meeting, I guess the action that's being taken is maybe to to substantiate that the board has agreed that there is interest, broadly speaking, and continuing with dialogue with borough hall in the in the relevant stakeholders, and so whether whether the board wants to put that, in a letter to ryan, to borrow hall, that that actually is the thing that makes most sense right now.
So if you could all lower your hand, if you have glenn just raised hitted yeah, it's just that a point of order was brought up, and that is that this whole meeting was predicated on the idea of us deciding whether we wanted to agree with the original borough president's letter and sign on with it or not, and instead of taking that vote.
I did post it in the chat, but for those of you who may not be able to read it, so I moved up the board authorized the chair to submit a letter to the borough president and the mayor endorsing the general concept of involving community stakeholders in a review of candidates being considered for appointment to police precinct, commanding officer positions and to continue the conversation with interested community boards and stakeholders in shaping that process to a fully detailed proposal.
