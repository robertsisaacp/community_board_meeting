Any decision made by the committee of the whole can be enacted immediately and will be ratified retroactively by the full board at our september 14th monthly meeting the matter before the full board today is whether the board wants to endorse a letter written by brooklyn borough president eric adams to mayor bill de blasio, which proposes to include community board input in the hiring of commanding officers of the co-terminus precinct.
I'm a cb14 resident for all the work that you all do and and for putting together this really thoughtful response to an idea that the borough president has put forward as a way to really increase community engagement in the in policing and to provide additional oversight at the at the most local of policing levels I wanted to just before I jumped into that.
But it's really a intended to be a beginning of a conversation that a lot of community boards are gonna have to have with their precincts and with their What we're looking to do right now, primarily, is to just engender support for this idea and then even possibly, given the fact that you've outlined a lot of really important questions that need to be answered and that need to be laid out potentially identify a local, a local, a pilot project for something like this and, in speaking with the borough president, it sounded like we would be open to sort of you know, pitching a proposal from the community board about how the formation of the panels is created, how the bylaws of the panel are created and pitching that to the mayor and to the commissioner directly.
What we had envisioned was that the commissioner would would pro would present three qualified candidates based on their existing processes of determining who's qualified to become a precinct commander, and then this committee, this new form this panel, would be able to interview candidates and provide you know, receive additional background information about the candidates and make a decision about who they wanted to represent their community with the understanding that community boards precinct community councils have the most local knowledge of what communities need and what types of what types of policing they want in their communities and identifying the candidate that best aligns with that with that vision.
We want to have a conversation with community boards and community members about how we're going to create this sort of panel and bring that to the mayor and the commissioner to encourage them to participate in this in this process, and then so that would be.
I don't have the authority to say what kind of tools would be would be provided, but I do know that, as with the reforms to 50a, that information is going to be more transparent and more accessible to the public, but what I would what I would hope to see in and I think what the borough president would hope to see in this project would be for local communities to identify what exactly what the, what could be these panels would identify what they would need in sort of the formal form formation of the of the panels.
So what the borough president put in his letter would be the formation of a panel that included representatives from the public safety committees of the relevant community boards and the policing police precinct community councils.
We're looking to you know, push this to the mayor and say: let's work together to identify a format that works with input from local community boards, so the letters the questions that were put together by cb14 were incredibly helpful for us to think about this and will be incredibly helpful as we're speaking with the mayor about this.
What I mentioned about a pilot project is that if cb14 or another community board wanted to you know, propose this to be a pilot in their particular district, we would be willing to work with those groups to bring it to the mayor and to the commissioner, because obviously this would be a conversation with the with the administration as well to to develop what the final product would look like.
and I'm really happy to hear you talking about in instead of the borough president and the office of the borough, president working out all the details of what that involvement would look like you want to involve community boards and sort of crafting that, and you know, co-creating what that might be.
and you know the chances of the mayor really buying into this plan, and I would also say just as a general piece of feedback, because so much of the concern is around this lack of clarity, and I really like what I'm hearing from you about a panel or inviting a selection of community board members in that might be something really good to add to the letter.
So I'd like to move that we endorse the concept and submit a letter in line with what the borough president has been asking of design but say that, where maybe without wholesale, endorsing the exact wording, but something the fact that we want to continue the conversation about a greater role in community board and community organization involvement.
I did post it in the chat, but for those of you who may not be able to read it, so I moved up the board authorized the chair to submit a letter to the borough president and the mayor endorsing the general concept of involving community stakeholders in a review of candidates being considered for appointment to police precinct, commanding officer positions and to continue the conversation with interested community boards and stakeholders in shaping that process to a fully detailed proposal.
