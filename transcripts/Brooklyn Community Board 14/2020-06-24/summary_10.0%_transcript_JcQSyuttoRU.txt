All and I also just always appreciate the opportunity to acknowledge partners, but so since we can't do that, I did I did write a letter to one really outstanding agency through all of us, which has been the Department of Sanitation, and it may be even mentioned this last meeting, but they've gone well beyond the extra mile to take care setting up for and cleaning up after the many food, pantries and testing sites, and because it's quieter in our commercial street there's a lot of illegal drop-offs I just wanted to be I wanted to offer that, because some people had asked so I'd be happy to facilitate that communication.
If you'd, like faith is to, as many of you know, did begin today and our office just to report, my board is: we are not moving back into open, fully very swiftly, we're still waiting for some supplies.
I won't go too far down this road because we don't usually do service delivery, but I eat So we know we have had requests from community members who want to try to address the issue without calling three one, nine one and on our website we have added a letter for FDNY enforcement, but we also have some resources there.
Well, according to the agenda I'm, looking at, we move on now to a topical committees before we do, though, I know that we have at least one elected official presidential, aide and I Do the best I can first again, this is our last before the end of the year, and obviously we usually have our reception I've been going to the reception, I would say, probably for over 25 years, because I think I started when I was four, Mr. chairman, as some folks may know, my colleagues from Albany senators and fulfill their Assemblyman SEM, 5:15 and I had some important work to take care of at Kohlberg Park this week and it's been restored to the people today.
At our overall meeting at the Hume for this Human Services Committee, we were presenting a me Michael fund, the Brooklyn Public Library presented, and let us know what their continuing efforts some home and remotely they're still working with children, and they have lots of education going out using their budget wisely, and we also heard from the US Census.
I know this is the last meeting I wish everybody a quick summer as we're trying to figure out how to be opening city, but I've wanted to really touch base on election tomorrow.
The second thing that came up during our meeting was a letter that was penned by the borough president requested that the mayor put into effect a executive order, an accent for community board input on that executive order.
If we don't agree with the commanding officer the spirit of the letter, I think the borough president was looking at sit participants on civic participation from the community members, so that we have more input into that on the letter we do owe arm a response back onto the bar president's office and whether or not we believe that we want to sign on to that notion.
I don't know that the borough president has described two boards was my understanding that the Public Safety Committee, however, did want to present it to the board for discussion and vote or consensus Mr. chair I would like to comment on this letter.
Anyone who's willing to risk their lives for me and my family gets my vote, but we do know that there are a small number of police officers who probably should not be on the ball on the be working, and this letter to me is not any good, it has no teeth.
First I do want to commend the Borough President Eric Adams, for coming up with innovative ways to address the concern we have about policing about making sure black lives matter, making sure that policing is a just and equitable of community Public Safety for everybody.
I'm equally concerned about exactly how accountability will be accomplished if we're putting the community board in the mix of it, along with the visits in the letter, community board leaders, community council, leader and other elected officials to vet and then have the ability to veto a person who is, you know, being considered for control at a precinct from being in consideration Will they be well informed so that they could be countable to our board, that they've made good choices based on our policies and values for our community and then being a representative voice that way?
chair I would like to make that motion to postpone, with the request of the borough presidents office, would provide us with more details about what this plan would look like if implemented.
as well, not send the letter at all, so I do feel, like the timing is really important and I think it's actually a really interesting idea and a great opportunity to have a community court be part of a really important process in a way they haven't been before I appreciate and respect the complexity of those decisions, but I just feel like it would be an opportunity missed and that the details could be worked out later.
We have the committee of the whole in able to convene the board whatever public meeting notice Department we need to.
Yes, my motion was to postpone consideration until we got the information from the borough presidents office with more detail, and that point it would be up to Okay, it's been properly moved and seconded it's there again any or the discussion before we before we vote chair may I be recognized.
, don't know what the correct Robert's Rules are chair, but what I would like to do is actually vote on the actual motion and move forward with the borough.
If anything, that might give us momentum as a board to advocate for additional reforms and to Joe appreciate the lesson I, don't I do know very little about the commanding officer role, but I do know that I think they're in charge of setting the culture of the precinct, and that seems to be just as important as being able to implement accountability measures.
However, I'm a little bit trouble because I do feel that we do need to discuss this and come up with ways to be more proactive and be more involved, as community leaders, so I am totally against scuttling it, but I do think that we need to meet some of the questions that we want to ask of the borough president, and then we need we need to make decisions, and you know we're going to have to vote on that motion now.
I, just like to for the personal privilege , I think we should just do a vocal vote and go down the list of attendees board member This is a procedural motion just to wait until we get more information from the borough presidents office in order to act immediately after getting that information.
