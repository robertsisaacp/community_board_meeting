The board's policy is to encourage detailed public discussion of matters before the board and our committee meetings and let public hearings consequently accept by board members.
Orson's wishing to speak during the public comment period should call the board office ahead of time to pre-register district manager.
Ephraim chair recognizes Ephraim, Nuremberg, okay, so we'll move on then to the to the meeting agenda, starting with approval of the minutes have been distributed by email, so I'm going to ask for a motion to the minutes there.
All and I also just always appreciate the opportunity to acknowledge partners, but so since we can't do that, I did I did write a letter to one really outstanding agency through all of us, which has been the Department of Sanitation, and it may be even mentioned this last meeting, but they've gone well beyond the extra mile to take care setting up for and cleaning up after the many food, pantries and testing sites, and because it's quieter in our commercial street there's a lot of illegal drop-offs and they're still working the three.
If you'd, like faith is to, as many of you know, did begin today and our office just to report, my board is: we are not moving back into open, fully very swiftly, we're still waiting for some supplies.
Is you know you can't open the office, but the request is to not do that unless it's absolutely necessary and I feel like Anya and I have managed our productivity levels remotely and to the extent that we haven't I'll, be coming into the into the office a couple of days a week and certainly still have to pick up mail and I promised Orion I'd water, some plants, but we I'll keep the board posted through email when we open up full time or even full ish time right now, I'll be here a couple.
You know please let us know and we'll certainly take it into consideration and then speak to the Chairman about it, we're still working with a lot of our bids and other businesses to assist them with information on how they reopen.
You know our restaurants and are going to be cafes, a lot of them, and so I was on the phone call with d-o-t last Friday to try to get the information sorted out, but d-o-t said that they are going to approve they're, going to err on the side of approving and so and only really respond.
So we know we have had requests from community members who want to try to address the issue without calling three one, nine one and on our website we have added a letter for FDNY enforcement, but we also have some resources there.
I spoke with somebody, a lieutenant from Brooklyn borough south today, and there they're going to be providing a lot of materials, posters and flyers, and that sort of thing and we'll let you know when they can be you pick.
Well, according to the agenda I'm, looking at, we move on now to a topical committees before we do, though, I know that we have at least one elected official presidential, aide and I just like to give him an opportunity to say a few words Cal. Are you still with it?
Do the best I can first again, this is our last before the end of the year, and obviously we usually have our reception I've been going to the reception, I would say, probably for over 25 years, because I think I started when I was four, so I'm gonna miss it this you guys there are some great pictures hanging on the wall of me when I had more hair, and none of it was great look around you'll, find them good old ones.
She is, she knows every corner of the district and every problem that's happening frequently long before any of us do and she's usually honored by the time we start talking about it and I'm very grateful for how she's kept the board was functioning in her in a real way over the last three months, just a real, quick update and then I'll turn it back to you.
Mr. chairman, as some folks may know, my colleagues from Albany senators and fulfill their Assemblyman SEM, 5:15 and I had some important work to take care of at Kohlberg Park this week and we did and it's been restored to the people today.
It's almost an automated process, and only if there is a problem is there a No, so I've seen some of those pop up and I'm really happy because it you know me it may seem a little inconveniences to pedestrians and the like, but it's really important that we get our small businesses back up and running people who work there live in our neighborhoods.
We have great shopping district Oneonta and you could tell your roads, not in my district, but it's in the board didn't miss so many places where you can actually come to my Avenue ma Avenue J I'll do what you can I'm, not gonna, go on and on because everybody on this board knows I love, community board, 14 I love every edge of it been on this board for 18 years.
Okay, hearing no one I'm, not an elected official but I'm, a representative of an elected official, it's Benny Ringo from the maze, okay, Patti sure, just a low Sangalo and they're listening in and I will write down all the complaints, even though strong sends it to me as it happens, it's a son, good job, Thank, You, penny, okay, so we'll move on to topical committee reports, starting with youth services.
Of course, I will bring this directly to Donald logins meanness of gear, I, email, but kind of want to even get ahead a little bit, because the I was on a Prospect Park Alliance committee, a Comicon meeting, and there is a request from the parks.
If you want to be like them, let's get out rally the neighbors and lastly, also in the Ditmas Park area, from Cortelyou Road to foster the streets, abstract milk, Stratford and Spencer they're also doing great they're at sixty two point, five percent I also attended the meeting of the Brooklyn complete count committee with the borough president.
At our overall meeting at the Hume for this Human Services Committee, we were presenting a me Michael fund, the Brooklyn Public Library presented, and let us know what their continuing efforts some home and remotely they're still working with children, and they have lots of education going out using their budget wisely, and we also heard from the US Census.
Thank you so much for your time and please, let me know if you have any questions.
Thank You Joanne before we move on Shawn just reminded me that the chair of the Kings County, Democratic, Party, Assemblymember rod, needs to be shot, has just joined us and I'd like to give her every opportunity to address the board.
First everybody welcome I know this is the last meeting I wish everybody a quick summer as we're trying to figure out how to be opening city, but I've wanted to really touch base on election tomorrow.
I know there are a number of people who said that in DC get balanced, so we try to work both issues.
Are there any other elected officials online right now, okay, hearing none, we'll move on with our agenda committee co-chairs please on unmute your mic.
The second thing that came up during our meeting was a letter that was penned by the borough president requested that the mayor put into effect a executive order, an accent for community board input on that executive order.
If we don't agree with the commanding officer the spirit of the letter, I think the borough president was looking at sit participants on civic participation from the community members, so that we have more input into that on the letter we do owe arm a response back onto the bar president's office and whether or not we believe that we want to sign on to that notion.
Don't know if that's I don't know that the borough president has described two boards, how they would decide whether or not they're signing on it was my understanding that the Public Safety Committee, however, did want to present it to the board for discussion and vote or consensus I'll defer back to the to the chair on whether it's you know which one of those thank you district manager definitely wanted to make sure the board was aware of it and I'll throw it onto the board for discussion.
We did not have enough members of the Public Safety Committee on the call on Wednesday for us to make a determination on how we should respond so definitely wanted to give the board an opportunity to hear about it and provide some discussion of it.
Anyone who's willing to risk their lives for me and my family gets my vote, but we do know that there are a small number of police officers who probably should not be on the ball on the be working, and this letter to me is not any good, it has no teeth.
First I do want to commend the Borough President Eric Adams, for coming up with innovative ways to address the concern we have about policing about making sure black lives matter, making sure that policing is a just and equitable of community Public Safety for everybody.
I'm equally concerned about exactly how accountability will be accomplished if we're putting the community board in the mix of it, along with the visits in the letter, community board leaders, community council, leader and other elected officials to vet and then have the ability to veto a person who is, you know, being considered for control at a precinct from being in consideration and I'm wondering a few things about that?
Does that work such that our board is going to be given the resources to look at personnel files, so that our representatives in that discussion, which could be the board chair, might be the district manager?
I would like to move to postpone consideration of agreeing to this letter, and so I am making this motion up until whatever point in time.
So then we can evaluate the proposed reform, which I think we do need meaningful reform to gain the trust of community of police, to work together and in a way that works for everybody.
chair I would like to make that motion to postpone, with the request of the borough presidents office, would provide us with more details about what this plan would look like if implemented.
Okay, yes, and let's see if my baby starts crying, so just regarding Jonathan's motion, but also just as part of the general discussion.
Honestly I feel like if you get the details worked out and you revise it and like I agree with you, it doesn't have a lot of teeth, but if we send this in two months, it's totally meaningless and like you might as well, not send the letter at all, so I do feel, like the timing is really important and I think it's actually a really interesting idea and a great opportunity to have a community court be part of a really important process in a way they haven't been before I appreciate and respect the complexity of those decisions, but I just feel like it would be an opportunity missed and that the details could be worked out later.
So that's a really big consideration: clarification from Borough Hall if we wish to move forward, I personally intend to abstain all right, but the second issue is there is no review, so somebody could come in with an excellent CV and we agree with them by in the event that they take actions or that they don't counsel their police in accordance with respectful police, and you know CPR that we see on the sides of their vehicles.
I just wanted to say a couple, quick things, I hear, I think it was Glenn's concerns about this particular proposal, not being the be-all end-all of sort of policing before him, but I, don't think it's mutually exclusive to any of the reforms proposed by Congress member Clark or other folks and I.
The second thing I wanted to say is that, while I respect that policing, that of course takes expertise and specialized knowledge, you know Frankie if NYPD was able to operate independently and sort of make leadership and systemic decisions on their own in good faith- and you know with the holistic community concerns in mind, we wouldn't be having this discussion in the first place.
So the idea that it's sort of impossible for us to know and make an informed decision, I strongly agree with I think it was Nicole's point that you know we vote for elected officials.
You know it's the community board votes on a transportation planning or a bike or a bus lane.
Mr. chair I just wanted to clarify the point of my motion because I think it addresses what everybody's talking about, namely that even in just hearing mr.
We have the committee of the whole in able to convene the board whatever public meeting notice Department we need to.
Richland point that there's this is the process for handling, and this is the information will be provided, so we can weigh in on it or being able to say well, you know what just like our public rather are our special permit process, where our guidelines are keeping character of the community and weighing in on math.
We know that the borough presidents office or anybody else that's working on this plan- can provide us with the details to review in earnest.
What if there is something we need to weigh in on, say, listen if this is included here, we think this does an even better job to accomplish for the borough president wants to accomplish.
We just don't really know exactly what this would look like and we want to make sure we don't do harm in a different way.
Yes, my motion was to postpone consideration until we got the information from the borough presidents office with more detail, and that point it would be up to I think the discretion of the chair to call a meeting.
Your point Joe earlier, although I learned dawning in this community work process which I had no idea about before I, think I can you know reasonably have some input into the into the selection of commanding, at least being one of the cities and democratically and the democratic process of warning community officer, so I would prefer to table or I.
Don't even I, don't know what the correct Robert's Rules are chair, but what I would like to do is actually vote on the actual motion and move forward with the borough.
If anything, that might give us momentum as a board to advocate for additional reforms and to Joe appreciate the lesson I, don't I do know very little about the commanding officer role, but I do know that I think they're in charge of setting the culture of the precinct, and that seems to be just as important as being able to implement accountability measures.
However, I'm a little bit trouble because I do feel that we do need to discuss this and come up with ways to be more proactive and be more involved, as community leaders, so I am totally against scuttling it, but I do think that we need to meet some of the questions that we want to ask of the borough president, and then we need we need to make decisions, can't just a be cavalier and scuttle this I I'm just totally.
If we please and I do agree that we need to table, but I think we also need to come up with a definitive time that we will be moving forward on it, and it should be as soon as possible that we can send our questions and then do another virtual meeting to make some decisions.
Smith I think John motion included that we submit our questions to the board office and that would you know, communicate to the board president.
chair I, just like to for the personal privilege, I think we should just do a vocal vote and go down the list of attendees board member I.
Okay, thank you board members for this lively discussion.
So just in case you know folks, when I like take a look at it or want to share.
