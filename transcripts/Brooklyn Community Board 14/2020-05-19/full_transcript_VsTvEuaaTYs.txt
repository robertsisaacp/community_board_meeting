There you go this April meeting of community board. 14 is called to order on Tuesday May 19th at 5:30, 6:00 p.m. under the applicable statutes of New York State, the charter of the city of New York executive order to zero 2.1 board, bylaws and Robert's Rules of Order. Today, attendants will be taking accounting for those signed into this leading and the roll call vote will not be needed. Brooklyn borough president's office informed Brooklyn community boards on April 22nd that boards are responsible for meeting the New York City Charter requirement to meet every month in September to June conditions imposed, do to the cupboard 19 and pandemic notwithstanding, however, that information was not timely enough, given the which is [Applause] again. If you are opposed on yourself, ask just ask for the nays and wait five seconds. Okay, any may ask for extensions now. The Clara pass then adjourn the meeting motion. The meeting is adjourned. There are people with their hands raised point one: the board's bylaws we're meeting virtually on WebEx and I'd like facilitating this meeting and the board 14 staff for coordinating board members, elected officials and the community, and all of you who are attending this meeting. Thank you as the first order of business. We need to approve the March minutes. The minutes from the March meeting via email on April 14, is that correct manager they were distributed on May, 14th and then again today this afternoon, I'm a fortune. Okay and members have had a chance to review those minutes so other in questions or Corrections on board members chairman Powell. This is Steve Cohen, something a motion to approve the March minutes. Mr. chairman, this is Gayle Smith I. Second, the motion. Okay, it's been properly moved and seconded to approve the March minutes, all those okay, all those in favor raise your hand or say I, say nay, the minutes, our district manager, Sean 1000, everybody so nice to kind of sort of almost see you I just quickly want to begin by thanking my staff. Onion Urbina who's been really stalwart through challenging times and I want to acknowledge Anya's work in keeping our website up to date, which is even more than a once a day task. She worked with Jonathan judge who we were able to contrast, two ways on very short notice to upgrade our website. So thank you to her for that extra work into John judge for the quick turnaround on that and just quickly coming to the plate on our service delivery. A lot of it is the same, but very much of it is very different. You know we're still handling regular complaints and concerns do be do te sanitation, but if first many requests are new and were just a short time ago, pretty unimaginable assisting their food, pantries and testing sites. We've got a new one in the district on Coney, Island Avenue, and then you know, request from Funeral Homes as well we're trying to assist anybody who's, doing something good and necessary for the community, with this little red tape as possible and we're just it's amazing to see the community members who've come to filling gaps and distributed food, especially coke bo WLAN and mass beer, to make sure that there's halal and kosher meals available to families and a lot of our businesses have gotten very creative. So when the thanked the elected officials to first for staying in touch and being supportive where we've needed- and we do receive your updates daily and we continue to participate in the many zoom and WebEx and conferences and meetings with CEM in HR and Roll Hall better and that Benham forms what we put up on our website, I've been in touch with colleagues regarding the budget process which has been you know, changed drastically. So we're talking about a different approach to budget consultations in the fall and extreme shift in revenues has affected our board. We were oh I'm, sorry Office of Management and Budget helped themselves to $4,000 out of our budget and gave us a heads up that in the next fiscal year, they'll be taking 9,000 and we're working to expend the $42,500 that city council provided to us. But it's become a little bit more challenging since we can't get deliveries so well and have work done in the office, but hopefully we'll have that done by the end of the fiscal year. As many of you know and arenas not with us on the meeting tonight. But it has nothing to do with the fact that she's also retiring, and so we only have a few weeks left working with her and she's. Trying to train me on some of the tasks that she's taken on, and it just means that Anya and I are preparing ourselves for a little bit heavier lifting over the summer, because I anticipate that hiring somebody is going to confront some challenges. But we will, you know we'll get it figured out. They know it that I've got a terrific board to call on if I need you so keep your ears open, because I might be doing that, and that is all yeah. That's all I have to report on this evening and we can move back to you. Whoever has a hand raised I'm new to Salford and please that's okay. The answer was gonna, be no anyway fiscally you saying that they cut our budget, they cut our funding. Yes, they cut a line budget by 4000 in this current fiscal year and by 9,000 in the upcoming fiscal year. The retiring of arena will that help us absorb that cut, but will lead us to hire somebody at a you know at a more administrative in less you know, less function well, I mean we'll just have to hire somebody as more of an assistant than a service delivery person, and so it does require a different assignment of duties between me and Anya, and the next person who comes in but yeah it does. It will help us absorb. Are we in any immediate fiscal danger or shortages? No, in fact, we might have to give money back because the money that was provided by City Council was four OTPs and we just might not have time to spend it all. Given our inability to be in the office for to receive goods and services we're not giving back a lot, we put it to good use fairly early on, and that was one of the things I mentioned. Our thanks to Jonathan judge like we quickly entered into a contract to get our website updated, and he was quickly able to deliver it so that it can be done in time to pay him and expend those funds. Okay, anyone else and they have a board member hi. This is Billy. Richland I just have a quick question about the Euler application mentioned in the minutes for 1620 Cortelyou Road I know that all land-use proceedings are on hold for now and I assume that the public hearing about what have happened for this falls under that category. But is there anything new? We need to know about that project, or is it just on hold for the time being? Yeah you're gonna hear more about that in the chairs report, but it is on hold and once it is once the clock does start ticking again and I'm. Sorry out of fact, if I'm gonna make, you just have to repeat this, but I think we'll have 55 days that not too many days had elapsed before they stop the clock. So we'll still have 55 days to hold a public hearing. Okay, any more hands raised in Hindi, I'm, sorry I didn't mean to have it up it's still off or did it I'm trying to look? Is it supposed to say baby's hand or lower hand from my hands? It's down it's down, it should say raise hand there you go cha, hey I'm, here your hand is raised. This is just I want to mention that I'm, okay, Thank You chef, okay, if there are no more no more hands raised, we'll move on to the chairs report consists of two parts mainly well. The first part is well the main land use item that we are watching is the 1620 Court LD Road application Billy. You alluded to that. Assuming it moves forward, once the clock starts ticking again, we will have, as Sean mentioned about 55 days, to make a recommendation and we will hold a public hearing within that time. A second item the chair support is committee of the whole, the board's practice with respect to meetings and public hearings on issues. And/Or actions which may require a vote during the summer months is to hold these items over to September. The board will convene virtually should there be an item that requires a vote, in which case it is recommended that the board on a resolution empowering a committee of the whole to take action on behalf of the full board. This enables the board to satisfy its quorum requirement during the summer months. This motion is being enacted one month earlier than usual. As for the cities and states, social distancing, I'll get that right guidelines and prepare support for the year challenges of meeting in quorum requirements prior to be prior to being able assemble, and that concludes the chairs report, and at this time we move on to our guests I'm sorry to interrupt, but you would need a motion activity of the hall. Mr. Chairman I move I move to adopt emotion, as you just stated, to appoint the board it's common Jaeger. How are you do point? The board test, Services Committee of the hall, to act during the months during this period of time when the board can't meet in full? This is Joe okay, so it's Joan, I, assume, then I! Guess the questions. Be you as well as for cow? Is it obvious? There is a committee of the whole that needs to be convened it with the remotely I trust it would be yes, mr. chairman, it would be if I may answer it would be in a consistent with the current executive order of the governor so far as long as he is permitting under state law for boards and councils and legislators and the like, [Applause] okay, that was happy virtual meeting. It's a pleasure to be here, friends and neighbors. Meeting 4:14. Certainly I want to thank president Powell district manager, Sean Campbell and the board the Executive Board. Thank you so much for your hard work. Thank you for keeping all of us informed and serving our constituents during this pandemic. It's been trying too many of us, and many of us I know have lost someone. We know one may be close to them, but we staying strong was staying. Strong I first want to thank all of you for your support. We in the state level have in session in conference remotely. We actually went to Albany right before the shutdown to test on the budget, and we did- and you know, there's been some cuts, but the whole focus has been around making sure that our hospitals, our essential workers, the operation of the state city government, are in full effect and just a lot of work. A lot of work to do so we're going to be zoom session, I believe sometime next week, that will be made public I know the City Council has been full force ahead of us, and so I want to take that floor. Continuing the duties of the people in the city remotely so to you common Jaeger to you fire Lewis. Thank you, I, don't know if you have anymore of City Council members. Thank you for your work because we look to you as well to serve as a model receiving them. Some people are maybe tired of them. Some people are saying: hey, continue and bring them on, but our office has been working diligently with the city, the mayor's office, with the governor's office, to make sure that we get every information on a daily basis to you, whether it's news regarding shut down or reopening testing centers, whatever it may be food banking school whatever it is, we try to make sure that will continue, so we don't typically send pulled it updates every day, but the two or updates in general every day, but for this particular situation we're sending every day. So please patient with us, hopefully God willing once dis dies, you won't be getting information from us on a daily basis. In the past, we've held a number of conferences and I want to thank immunity. 4:14 for participating we had to constituency information conference calls we had one in March. We had one in February dealing with social services, stimulus package unemployment. We recently partnered with me on that, and we recently had a small business information. As you know, we were able to get to texting sites in our district and in the one on 1095 Flatbush. Now, they're opening testing sites all over, including schools, places of worship. So if you know your place of worship is interested in opening a testing site or your educational institution, please let us know we're opening all over and we're doing this because I don't know. If some of you saw me on the news, the whole point is to get all of us tested. We do not know much we're still finding out what this virus is. There's no real vaccine can use. We don't know if we can reinfect antibody. So this whole research is happening, and so we want to be precautious, but the best thing is everybody to get tested, we're not only getting tested for the virus, but we're also testing antibodies, they're, also coming out with a new way of testing. So it's not who your knows, but they are also doing the saliva testing, which may be taking the place of the nasal test. Unemployment has been the single most inquiry that we've been getting in our office. Just so you know, the elected officials are working, the Department of Labor and we have a specific portal in a specific form that our offices are working with individuals to call in terms of the unemployment. The Department of Labor have opened up a new online portal for anybody, labored NY, gov and you're supposed to get a response within 72 hours. If you don't get a response within 72 hours definitely call us. We have a specific portal, that's assigned to us where the governor's folks and the Department of Labor are literally looking at our requests. The people who have been having trouble and fill out a form on behalf of that constituent, my office and many offices are servicing. People are saying our district boundaries, so you know it is what it is. We're helping everybody, but one of the sensitive information that we're that we need to get from people are their full nine-digit social security level. Many people are very uncomfortable with that. Some people share that with us. We do not retain it anywhere, we don't store it. We just keep the last one digit. We have spoken to the Department of Labor in terms of putting in an algorithm that will not require the nine digit where you can use your mapping your date of birth and some other way of identifying you as a unique person. So we are working diligently and making sure that this online tool is very safe and secure, but for now it is mandated that you give us the nine digit social security in terms of food pantries. As you know, we have been working to different tracks with this with the governor in terms of getting a lot of our nonprofit organizations Panchita and our churches fancied up with longer process, because it's been a void in the Flatbush area, where we don't have many entries. I certainly wanted the sink hole and bio for their services, because they were able to expand to help many people on the other side of Flatbush too, with food. You certainly want to thank them for that, and we want to thank them for introducing halal in the school in the schools for grabbing gold. We also want to thank EE zeglen who's been who actually introduced it kosher before the schools did, and so we were working very closely with him and I'm going to thank him personally, because it was a model and it was something that we were asking for very long time and he was doing it before, but I'm happy. The city responded. So we have kosher and I know Khamenei here as well as Assemblymember simcha I can sign the form of them had partnered and really hard to make sure that we got culture so I'm very happy that our partners able to produce, which is that we all should be included. Everybody should be eating and the grabbing goals in all of our schools and institutions are open to both children and families. If you are quarantine, there is a special number, you can call p11 and the wheels on Wheels program roll is aligned to help the people's quarantine. We also want to let you know that we are poised to May 28th and the state government will continue to enforce until June 13th. We have been partnering for local elected officials to be distributing masks this coming Saturday. We will be distributing masks and in Little Haiti, it's open to everybody by st. Jerome's from 12:00 to 2:00, and that will be decided. May 23rd, however, and I'm partnering with councilmember Barry Lewis, who did an excellent job. She'll tell you what she did with Assemblymember Helene, Weinstein and she's, also Kevin Parker, so we actually copied what she did and she offered to help us do the same thing over in Little. Haiti has not been getting anything so just want to. Let you know that we are here for you, any information you need. Please call my office at seven, one: eight, nine, four, zero, four, two, eight again: seven one, eight, nine, four zero four, two: eight as a new Brooklyn Democratic County leader I'm, no longer serving only a forty seven Assembly District I'm serving the entire Brooklyn, so I get calls from everyone and my office, my three-person staff, but I want to thank you for all your support from evil 14 and stay vigilant and stay safe, Thank, You, councilmember, Yeager for yielding and president Powell. Thank you for allowing me to speak and district manager Sean Campbell. Thank you, I guess I can take my virtual money use it over to my council member. My friend, please. Okay, thank you know formal with the board I like to be recognized. I've had me at work first, mr. chairman, thank you much ACEF woman, Prasad they've been incredible. Thank you. I want to start. Obviously it's been said, but you know on our team. The community board has been incredible. They I could not have asked for you know it's not a secret board. 14 I'm, a little partial I, have my four boards board. 14 is my favorite I say that often I live in 14 I was a member of 14 for 18 years. This is my home and Shawn, and her team have been incredible as I'm, seeing it in person and I've seen the work that they're doing to keep and to keep our happening in a real way. I also thank very much my partners at the city council, councilmember, Lewis, councilman, Dutch, councilman Eugene, our former colleague here on the board. They have been incredible advocates at City Hall under very trying times really to fight for what we need back in our neighborhoods as some of them to shop mentioned. The food program was incredibly important to fara, to myself, to high into Matthew to really work, to bring it into our neighborhood, not just for kosher but for halal and to make sure that every kid who needs a meal is able to get their hands on one. No shame: no questions asked go to your school and get a meal, and you know it's trying times if people need that a little extra help and which aren't hard to give them what we can I'm not going to give an update on Department of Labor I. Think every elected official in this. In this meeting he has their own horror stories, but, as assemblywoman bichotte said, the Department of Labor has sort of stepped on the gas a little bit and they're, giving us some extra tools over the last couple of days and weeks to help us get help for people who are who have applied to need to apply who are trying to get answers. So I will tell you the worst possible answer that anybody can ever give in my line of business. Please be patient, but don't hesitate to call any of us whether you know whether you call your city representative, you say, representative or whoever you want or call one of us if you're having a problem. So we can cue you up in the system to make sure somebody's taking a look at your case. Don't have to call all of us just call one of us so that somebody's doing it, but we all have access to the same tool and we're using it to try to get people straight answers on where their cases are, and some things are just really simple. I had a case today, that's been pending for literally two months and all the gentlemen needed to do was get a piece of paper into them. They just haven't called a nest for it, so you didn't do it and we got the answer and we got it done so, if you're having this, if you know anybody who's having this, if somebody calls you up and says that they're having this problem, just please refer them to one of our offices or send them over to the community board. The community board will get you a number somebody one of us to call our state Reps. Obviously assemblywoman bichotte mentioned everybody. I am very grateful for my partners and my leaders in the state assembly in the state, Senate Senators, all their southern actions seen have been incredible. I see several risk. I see Bobby Carol's here, Oh assembler, my team of simplice have really worked hard together with Rodney's. To get this ferret I am too he flatbush Midwood. Are you know, really strong and to keep trying to do the things we're doing to just sort of maintain some semblance of normalcy, one semblance of normalcy? That I can report is that the street cleaners from Ace that you know I fund through the council I know Farrah does as well I. Think time does as well too sweet our commercial streets. We, it would kind of sent home when the when the sending home happened and they were still getting paid. They were getting taken care of, but they weren't out there doing the doing the street cleaning. You know as businesses were closed, it kind of maybe it wasn't necessary, but also it just they weren't protected they're doing it now they started yesterday are they're back out. You'll also see them on the routes that we found. They're disinfecting the bus stops and they're using these same disinfectant to heavy-duty stuff that the subway system is using not telling you to get on the bus I'm not telling you get on the subway, but I'm just telling you that they are trying to do some of the things to try to bring us back to some semblance of normalcy. I. Just also want to make sure that it gets mentioned. It'll surely be mentioned again your time, but there is a primary on June 23rd. It is still happening. It's unclear as it stands right now. It's a prep. There is also a presidential primary, not sure. If that's going to last, it was a very bad court decision that made us hold the presidential primary, even though there's actually nobody running in the Democratic primary, but we have to have it anyway, even if we don't, we still have state and local races. We have members of our community people who we support. People who we don't support, doesn't matter. You have to show up to vote. People are looking whether or not we're gonna come to, though oh you don't actually have to physically show up the governor allowed people to vote by absentee whether or not you want to go. You don't have to go. If you don't want to go, it's the easiest thing to do. Go online, the WWN, why see absentee com request? An absentee ballot does send one out to you. The Board of Elections created a great tool. It's easy to do it tonight after we hang up, you don't have to vote it right away. If you want to hang on to it, you want to think about it, but at least get the application in to give yourself the ability to make that choice later on. I really have nothing more to say, I see. My council colleague is here and she's gonna tell you all the things that I miss, which are probably plenty, but it's really good to see you Sarah. Thank you. So much chairman I see that assembly member has also joined us I. Do yes, thank you so much ad I'm good evening community board 14. It is wonderful to see all of you via the Internet. Hopefully we will all be able to see each other sooner rather than later, when we get through this terrible pandemic sure highlight a couple of quick things and just some thank yous Community Board 14, some of its members. Some of your members have just done such extraordinary work in this trying. Time and I want to highlight some of the great organizations along Coney Island, Avenue, COPO and Mo Roz V heyo pays lakeil and Akasha Hussain have all been working tirelessly to help feed some of our neediest community members. Who've been impacted by Covid-19, 19 I was glad and notionally and I was glad to go out and help. All of them distribute food to families in need. So thank you all and to all the other people who I missed, who have been you know, lending their time and giving to those most in need, thank you and obviously to all of our first responders frontline workers. Thank you so much. Let me just echo a couple of quick things that I heard the assembly. Member of the see council member mention Department of Labor issues. Their massive. There is a massive backlog. Please feel free to reach out to my office. My legislative aides have been so helpful: Mary Kay, Victoria, Gunn, zinger dan Campanelli, in assisting folks with the Department of Labor, but, like councilman Yeager said, unfortunately, you will have to be patient. The backlog is long and it continues another very important thing. The state legislature is likely to go back into session next week. We have a common prints on Friday. One of the things we will hopefully be discussing is a bill of mine that would require insurance companies to pay business interruption insurance due to kovat 19, currently they're denying it. This is so essential for so many small businesses in New York. So please pay attention to what's going on in the state legislature over the next two weeks, I do believe we're going to be passing legislation that impacts small businesses, tenants, homeowners and it's gonna be so important that we get this right because we're not gonna get a lot of bikes at this Apple. So please feel free to reach out to me. If you have any questions about that, I would love to talk to you about that, because it is so important that, once it is safe to start resuming some normal activity to protect our tenants or small businesses, our homeowners, so that we can get people back on their feet once we've beaten this virus I don't want to go on any longer. It's great to see all of you virtually I hope to see all of you in the flesh sooner rather than later feel free to reach out to my office, 7 1, 8, 7, 8, 7, 2, 1, 7, 1, 8, 7, 8, 7, 2, 1 or email me at Carol or and NY assembly gov. If you have any questions, thank you so much Adam, Thank, You, Carol, councilmember, Farrell Lewis good evening. Everyone I hope everybody is well and with all of those impacted affected. My pulpit hope to see you all soon and me physically I'm, happy to see my colleagues here, Carol I just wanted to say thank you for all your hard work and the council. You were on a very long time today, so thank you for advocating for the people of New York City I also want to thank Campbell president and the entire board, or keeping up and having this meeting really hard to ask the mayor's office to provide a license to all the community boards in our district in order for us to meet, because while we all are descent, we can still be connected, and this is the way to do it so I'm grateful that we have the capacity to provide this service and continue the good work that we do in our community. Some of the things that we've been working on in my office and collectively with all of my colleagues and it's been providing service. As my colleagues mentioned earlier, we have we've also expanded our pantry access, the mayor designated 25 million dollars towards that, and that's been really helpful to some of the faith-based institutions and our district, where they able to provide our seniors and anyone that needs it and for clinical support. I'm, really proud to say that we have a second location that I mentioned earlier on Coleman Avenue. He advocated for testing and it was really hard to get it, but I'm happy that the administration responded, and now we have that as a resource for folks to get tested. So please utilize it and share the information and know you can go get tested for free and for small business support a lot of our small businesses. Some of them didn't even know how to fill out the loan application. So we were able to partner with a woman named Maya Whaley. She started a initiative which drives what we were able to get volunteers to help folks fill out applications for their small businesses, where they can receive funds from the federal government, so that work continues until we get back to whatever normal would be, but I'm just grateful that all of you took the time to meet me and feel free to call my office if you need anything while we're closed for working remotely, our office number is seven one, eight, six, two, nine twenty nine hundred open Monday through Friday nine to five but just remotely, and thank you all and please be safe, Thank You, councilmember Louis. We appreciate you joining us at tonight. We also have with us the 42nd Assembly District Josh Pierre Josh. Are you here? Yes I'm here to thank you, chairman, Powell good evening, cd14 district leader Josh, here I hope everyone's been coping well and they're. Your family members are safe, but as the Greater Flatbush area and create board, 14 residents continue to deal with the fallout of the koban 19 crisis. I think it's critically important that we pay close attention to the budgets. Terry impacts on neighborhoods like Kensington and Flatbush. So, while fiscal discipline is very important, the proposed budget right now disproportionately harms neighborhoods like ours in the area and I'm gonna point out two of the hard facts there about 231 million in proposed cuts to the education budget, of which there is a hundred million that comes out of the fare schools funding program and what that program does. Is it's a source of funds for schools and it tastes needs that needs based approach to education funding. So, for instance, schools receive more funding per student if they have students that are second, that have English as a second language, and it basically makes the funding system more equitable. So here's the issue when you look at a community when you look at the communities that you live within cd14, you have kids, who speak Urdu, kids, who speak Asian, Creole and Spanish who benefit from that fun. Now, when that funding disappears, it doesn't mean those programs necessarily go away. It just means that more is both from the greater pot and its divvied up amongst more students. So it's one factor that affects us in the budget. The other factor among many is the 80 million dollars in cuts to sanitation, in my entire time, I'm going to block association meetings, commune board meetings and any type of civic meeting I've. Yet to hear anybody say: oh we've had so much garbage pick up. The streets were too clean, it's quite the opposite. People constantly that there's not enough garbage pickup. They don't want to deal with the alternate side of the street parking, but they eat sure one the streets to be clean right, so I see commercial corridors like ours, along nostril, Navi, Flatbush, Avenue, Cortelyou, Road being negatively impacted by some of these cuts, and so we have to also consider what are the long-term ramifications for small businesses along our corridor, such as quartile I'll be wrong, so those are just two cuts that I wanted to point out. I, don't believe that these types of austerity measures arm should be taking in such a way that the budget is balanced on the backs of the neediest communities and I. Think that type of action hurts Flatbush. It hurt students Park, it hurts children and it shouldn't be I. Don't I think it contradicts our values as a community budget cuts balanced. All the back of communities like working-class trees in Flatbush, so I did recently write an op-ed that lists out some of the other issues, especially with regards to housing and how those cuts will impact that you can look it up on the BK reader and the titled lay out. That is what proposed budget cuts mean for Flatbush and the 40th council district I would encourage you to read that, and secondly, there are also an absolute cut to the SYEP program, which is the Summer Youth Employment Program, and the last thing we want our students, our kids, to be safe. You want are used to be safe during this process, but let's be clear. Remote learning and remote work will not become part of our future economy, and if there are people currently able to do remote work, then it stands to reason that there's possibly be jobs for youth that can do remote work, and so our first step is to sure that there is actually funds in the budget for that and the second step would be to look for opportunities for them over the summer. I want you to keep in mind that, for me, growing up and other working-class kids in Flatbush the opportunity to have Summer Youth paycheck was not just to remove a burden and put more money in my pocket. It actually helped me fund the household finances for my working-class family, so I strongly encourage you guys to consider the budgetary impacts. I know we're going through these health crises, but it's forward thinking community work that allows us to maintain the quality of life as we go into. What's gonna be a very rough budgetary situation when it comes to the city and the state so I. Thank you all for evening. The operation speak on this I, encourage you to read up on those op eds and stay informed, stay safe and God bless. Thank you, Thank You Josh. Are there any other elected officials that was everybody who pre-registered from an elected officials office, so I believe that we've covered that them and can move on to the topic of committee reports. If you want a directive there, Thank You Sean, something came to mind. I wanted to ask Cal and Farah starting in case there is a opening up of restaurants. I am anticipating that restaurants are going to want to have more cafe, seating or sidewalks, and with that, can they keep that in mind for any proposed opening of restaurants, because that will create more space. The council just passed the law few days ago to allow any business that has an existing sidewalk cafe license to get their money back so this year, under the theory that it's really not fair, to ask them to pay for something that they're not getting in our district. We really have a clamoring, for we haven't had a clamoring for outdoor cafe licenses, you have some. We don't have a lot if stores want to avail themselves of outdoor cafe. Licenses is an easy process to do. The Community Board deals with them in-house on a regular basis, and they can start the process if they wished by going to the department, Consumer Affairs website and getting the information to make an application, but for right now, as long as restaurants are closed, you know I'm not sure they really want to do that they have the ability to seat. Customers is restricted inside and outside for now, calcio again participating. Is it fate if the 25 or 50 percent capacity, they're gonna need tell you muted yourself in these I it again I'm sorry, the thought was that in case we go to 25 or 50 percent. They're gonna need I agree, that's part of it. I mean if the store wants to. If restaurant wants to have outdoor seating, there are some places that it works there, some places that it doesn't so, for example, you can't do it alone, II, on the Avenue, between J and K. It's just no place, but if on Cortelyou road or off on Evan, if Jam you J, if it works in this room for two or three tables outside it's something that they want to consider, they can ask through the application process, and obviously you know we would advocate I- think without making a broad rule, but on a case-by-case basis, I think that the community board. We would look at these applications in a different light, as long as it is not dangerous to public safety and to traveling on the sidewalk, and things like that. Yeah can't block the sidewalk from access. We would try to do that, but very few restaurants have the kind of frontage in front of this store that they could put more than two tables back type, because things happen very quickly here regarding this obviously and I wanted them to be aware. The other thing was that, for the summer, youth programs, one of the big things- is councillors summer councillors and those are not being funded, because that is not going to be any camps. I, don't think those two necessarily go hand in hand. Summer camps are gonna, be a decision that the governor makes based on whether or not he allows camps to open the city funding summer counselors for camps is not necessarily hand in hand with camps, opening camps that opened hire counselors, whether or not they receive a subsidy from the city to pay for that is what's really up in the air right now. The Summer Youth Employment employment program that the councilmembers at least to represent this board, are fighting hard. You get the administration to agree to fund, but you know I'm a straight shooter, Joe and I'm not gonna lie it's not looking good excuse me, gentlemen. Yes, that you guys continue this offline, we gotta move on with the agenda. If you don't mind next up is our topical committee reports, beginning with the youth services, is Jonathan judge on the line. I am here mr. chair and I'm, going to do something that I've wanted to do for a very long time, which is do a little multimedia. If it we present Wow but see if you'll have you know, you see my screen, those of you who are doing well, [Applause], you're gonna, greet someone, you know wash your hands because we were still trying to be mindful of it at that time. There wasn't a requirement to really, if you think about it, everything that was going on, but they register ations. We had obviously the number people who was a little bit expected because of the concern we're running coronavirus. However, as you can see, we have Mendes turnout still, so that means that many young people were able to find those opportunities. More and surely, even if some of them don't pan out for this year because of the pandemic, those are connections and relationships too. That can be capitalized later on throughout the year once things get some hosting us, the food co-ops for providing the tips and the apples that nourish everybody, including a lot of mock, interviewers and the and the organization laps to come to sustain them for the three hours of intense Gale, Smith, Joanne Brown. Of course, the co-chairs of the Youth Services Committee drain and myself Mansur overseen chair a pal callin me Caesar dawn Walker, Niki, Levinson, Angulo and Sen. They were really integral and making sure that this event happened and helped us roll with the punches and a lot of the changes that we would have to do throughout the months leading up to update everyone about what organisations were coming and what the game plan was for the event. I want to thank the young professionals of the Chamber of Commerce for spearheading our mock interview. Portions and I would like to volunteers, Jimmy, hands, Sophie halter, Ashley, B, gene Shannon, Logan, John, servidio, Danielle Mary, because she just came to check it out and we had a couple of dropouts for the mock interviews and she decided like a real pro to jump in when his picture of her sitting with some of the teens performing the Duane. If I could just quickly interject on that point as well. Very special. Thank you to the council member Louis, because we actually just to do one or two interviews: Jesse stayed for almost an hour and a half and the kids are the feedback from the kids and their parents was tremendous. So very special. Thank you for her or for doing that. Definitely absolutely we business points from March we're going to have an event for SYEP for some Youth Employment Program, specifically toward businesses and other types of organizations or nonprofits that might provide job opportunities through the program so that they could learn a little bit more. What it looks like from the employers side to participate in the program come down to because they have tremendous experience working with onboarding providers through their for their contract, that they they're one of the main s. Why need the clearinghouses, and so they were a new presentation, of course, because of all the changes due to the pandemic, we had to cancel that, of course, some point in the future. We hope to reschedule that for future for future potential employers, who've always been people that came to our conference, in spite of everything, the opportunities that they were looking for their future. So does anything else you want to add no I mean I just want to you know: I, do your condolences to everyone that lost family members loved ones because of this virus meant to those that fell ill, that you're, covering I, hope, you're, healthy hope, you're well in your family as well, and we look forward to you know at some point having a debrief about the conference. There are a lot of. There was a lot of good feedback, young people and work sites and providers. So we'd love to be able to debrief the community on that effort and hard work and making this very productive community, but really the anchor has been the office and just one again thanks Sean Anya and Irina for everything that they do for the conference last, but by far, not least at all. So again, thank you very much. All right, I'll get back to you. Mr. chair I can job next up, Human Services Committee Joanne. Are you with us I'm Joanne down here? How is everyone hi, I'm Joanne Brown co-chair of the Human Services Committee speaking on behalf of aza Ruby, who is also the co-chair of this committee? I guess: I have no report. We were to me shortly before the epidemic started and just check in my video just before the epidemic sort of took hold, but we did not have that meeting and so I'm here to talk to you about what I usually talk to you about, which is the census and I have some besides I, don't see my video app yet when it when it comes up, I'll show you my sides, I've really just give you a couple of details. It's been 68 days since the census began mailing out their unique ID numbers to residents of United States so that they can begin the process of answering the survey she's called since then Kings County, as today, according to the heart account map, has only had a response rate of forty six point: six percent, that's versus last year's 2010 response rate of fifty seven point: two. That was the final self-response rate. Currently the average response rate in the United States is fifty nine point, six percent, so we're not doing so. Well again, I stood up to my stance in my video, but if there's something here's my slides, because there are people and I'm not as technical as Jonathan, we can see you if you want to try to share your screen. So there you go Kings County, self-response rate versus the US, so we need to do better. So there's a couple of areas within the district that could well use outreach in some attention. Let's start with progress, so this upper portion of Flatbush close to where I am blowing sappers Avenue all the way down to children and we have Churchill avenue, drown, really need some help. So if you have friends, neighbors family, that you can just really touch that word right now: the response rates only between thirty and forty percent. Okay. So when you need support response rate thirty to forty percent, so if you have family, if friends, whatever you could do to start spreading, the word we've got to get them numbers up. This is like thirty six percent in this area between us we're doing a little bit better forty to fifty percent better than the two other areas, but we could really use some attention: some outreach, our nonprofits or friends, or families or neighbors. However, we can connect at this time when we're a little bit disconnected in person and the interventions that were plans or nonprofits sort of work completely. You know these in-person meeting is just can't happen, so the good news is that the Bureau has extended the self response time to October 31st okay. So this gives us a lot more time to do outreach. Let's really take advantage of that. We need every day that we can get and that's about it from my report. I just want to bring this back around and say ten minutes. Ten questions ten years. I really hope that we don't need another organism like SARS Kobe - in the next ten years, but our ability to handle another pandemic is going to rely on census, data that is collected and the money that we are allocated. So it's very important going forward that we try to do whatever we can to get our numbers up again, we're only at forty six point: six percent in Kings County, it's good to see everyone looking forward to seeing everyone in person, give it a little fist bump and thank you so much community environment regarding the census. If I may so two questions, I guess one I know that there's a way and I can't remember: if people don't get the former can't find it, but they can log in what is the site that they go to again. It's 2020 census, govt, 2020, census, govt gov, you can say your lab in there and there'll be a link that says: I don't have an ID number and you can follow that and look up your address and throughout the census. If you have patents that way, you can call the telephone number. So you sense. This website is very easy to navigate and it's very clear and gives you the at least two to immediate options that you fill out the census. The third most immediate option is to have a survey sent to you. Okay and the other question that I had or thought that I had was, is there some way, maybe that we could use the testing sites to put up some notices or something to remind people to do the census? I think it's a great idea, I think we could leverage so many so many opportunities. Now you know to distance well in a distance fashion, to remind people to say that the senses I think the coordinates are testing sites, but definitely with help. If our council, members and our assembly members could maybe get some of that material over there or pave the way to get material to those sites. So I think that's a good idea. I also think, especially for this first area, that I was talking about a little bit. Maybe we can ask became theater to change their marquee a little bit instead of saying we'll see you soon remind everyone that they have the senses to throw out. They have the time you know ten years, ten minutes ten questions ten years, so lots of ideas I think we still need to be talking about how we can do this, but do this in a way that conforms to our social distancing. Okay. So if you want to get back to me like that, channel I could help, maybe with a little bit of that. Okay, thank you, hi I, guess I guess I met. My video I have not heard anything, of course, because everything has of course been on hold. The only thing I want to say which kind of gets back to some of the other issues that were brought up is and I see it I guess more easily, because I ride my bicycle I'm, seeing a lot more broken glass on the street I'm, seeing a lot of dirty gloves and masks and I'm seeing a lot of dead rat. So we definitely have some sanitation issues going on in the community. Okay, edit Sean I just want to chime in and just remind everybody especially board members to bring specific locations to our attention in real time. So we can get the appropriate agency out there, education, libraries and Cultural Affairs no report. Mr. chair. Thank you public safety, either of the co-chairs with us transportation. I do want to mention three things. One completely unrelated the census is very easy to do. Online people need to know that is a lot of huggabug, but it boils that it's very easy, except when you get to the least questions. It's very easy. People need to know that and the community environment I to finding a lot of a lot of debris around, and if the people in your community can be encouraged, you know go out there with the gloves pick up stuff. You know on the strip between your house and your apartment. Building this you know, let's it makes it very difficult and frankly depressing time even more interesting. You know when you see stuff like that, so you thought my opinion should be encouraging their neighbors to clean up, but as far as transportation, you know the city is rushing to close down streets to create walkways and I. Guess. On some theory, that's a nice thing, but there's been some mix-up between DLT and the police about Newkirk Avenue. That caused some inconvenience, and this is not in our district, but they closed off a big length of Prospect Park West. What struck me is completely ridiculous, because why do people need an outdoor, a walkway there when it's adjacent to a very wide sidewalk? We're gonna stick to cd14 tonight and enter your committee, but the point of the matter is the transportation there soon of doing this? Without you know community input, and so perhaps we need to contact them and do something about that. Okay, Joe! Just before we move to the public session, there's just one thing: I wanted to mention. While we were all here and that is the passing of Ben Shafer I, don't know if everyone knew then he was just a great friend of all of splat bush Midwood, the entire a Community Board district Ben was the treasurer of the 70th precinct community council. He was, and he served quite some time as an axillary police officer, 7'o precinct and he was very much involved in political life and most of all, Ben was my friend so I just wanted to mention that and in passing he passed, you know he had the virus, the köppen 19 biros and he passed just a short time ago. So, having said that, we can move on to the public session and I'll call the public session. To order add us: did we list division choses here Shawn? Why doesn't the vice chair and it's the public session to begin and call the first speaker Smith? The first vice chair is actually going to read all of the public session announcements into the record and so Galle. If you just want to go ahead and note, only the time is 655 m and you can go ahead with the announcements that you received prior to 12:00 in today, okay good evening, I hope everyone is well and safe. Doing these very difficult and stressful times, I have five announcements to make on behalf of elected officials, nonprofit organizations and constituencies. So please just be with me: most of them are within reason. Some of them are a little lengthy. The first one is from congresswoman Yvette Dee Park of the ninth congressional district and I will be saying this verbatim, since she has a lot of things here. Thank you for keeping up the good fight against the pandemic. Your sacrifices bring our community one step closer to renewal each day on Friday night will pass the heroes act in the House of Representatives a bill that provides crucial relief and support for frontline workers who work tirelessly each day, while most of us remain sheltered at home to keep our city moving forward. While this legislation doesn't provide all that I believe is required to truly heal our nation, including greater provisions for affordable housing and immigrant protections. I voted to support our central workers, provide relief to those who are suffering and put our nation on the road to recovery. As many know, by now, a beloved Kings County as a devastating distinction of having more deaths due to cold at 19. Another cutter counties in the United States with a death toll exceeding that of 46 entire states. It was important for me to support this bill that pushes us toward healing our community and this nation. Among many things, the heroes Act well establish a 200 billion dollar euros fund to ensure hazard pay for central workers, provide nearly 1 trillion in much-needed support for state and local governments generate a second round of direct relief. Payments to families and individuals commit another 75 billion for the testing, tracing and treatment of COBIT 19 support. Small businesses by strengthening the payroll production protection program. I am especially proud of team Clark. My staff, who continue to assist me in delivering thousands of packages of food and PPE to constituents throughout the district.

Stringer come to controller Scott. Stringer has assembled a kovat resource guide. It can be found on our cd14 website and we thank our liaison from the controller's office Pinkus Hyken for forwarding it to the office.

Our names are Olivia and Jordan, and we have been residents of the Kensington and Flatbush Ditmas Park neighborhoods for seven years. The covert 19 crisis, particularly the way that it hurt the small businesses and the employees in our neighborhood, moved us to take action. We have recently founded a nonprofit organization, called Brooklyn donates, aiming to help small businesses across Brooklyn and New York City to survive this crisis. While we encourage donors to donate directly to their favorite local business, we also recognize that not all communities or businesses have equally received government or private funding by developing a central fund to distribute, grant grants to businesses and need. We are able to ensure equitable distribution of funds and remain especially conscious of the needs of underserved communities as well as my minority led businesses. We encourage any business owners or interested parties to reach out to us by email to get involved. The email addresses support at Brooklyn, donuts org or to check out our website Brooklyn donuts, dot, org. Thank you, and that is the end of the announcements mr. chair and if I could just jump in to remind everybody that all of the announcements that mrs. meecher's made all of the Flyers and the additional information posted on the website are there on our website to adjourn.
