as well we're trying to assist anybody who's, doing something good and necessary for the community, with this little red tape as possible just it's amazing to see the community members who've come to filling gaps and distributed food, especially coke bo WLAN and mass beer, to make sure that there's halal and kosher meals available to families and a lot of our businesses have gotten very creative.
As for the cities and states, social distancing, I'll get that right guidelines and prepare support for the year challenges of meeting in quorum requirements prior to be prior to being able assemble, and that concludes the chairs report, and at this time we move on to our guests Thank you for keeping all of us informed and serving our constituents during this pandemic.
We actually went to Albany right before the shutdown to test on the budget, and we did- A lot of work to do so we're going to be zoom session, I believe sometime next week, that will be made public Continuing the duties of the people in the city remotely so to you common Jaeger to you fire Lewis.
Some people are saying: hey, continue and bring them on, but our office has been working diligently with the city, the mayor's office, with the governor's office, to make sure that we get every information on a daily basis to you, whether it's news regarding shut down or reopening testing centers, whatever it may be food banking school whatever it is, we try to make sure that will continue, so we don't typically send pulled it updates every day, but the two or updates in general every day, but for this particular situation we're sending every day.
Hopefully we will all be able to see each other sooner rather than later, when we get through this terrible pandemic sure highlight a couple of quick things and just some thank yous Community Board 14, some of its members.
's gonna be so important that we get this If you have any questions about that, I would love to talk to you about that, because it is so important that, once it is safe to start resuming some normal activity to protect our tenants or small businesses, our homeowners, so that we can get people back on their feet once we've beaten this virus You were on a very long time today, so thank you for advocating for the people of New York City I also want to thank Campbell president and the entire board, or keeping up and having this meeting really hard to ask the mayor's office to provide a license to all the community boards in our district in order for us to meet, because while we all are descent, we can still be connected, and this is the way to do it so I'm grateful that we have the capacity to provide this service and continue the good work that we do in our community.
As my colleagues mentioned earlier, we have we've also expanded our pantry access, the mayor designated 25 million dollars towards that, and that's been really helpful to some of the faith-based institutions and our district, where they able to provide our seniors and anyone that needs it and for clinical support.
They don't want to deal with the alternate side of the street parking, but they eat sure one the streets to be clean right, so I see commercial corridors like ours, along nostril, Navi, Flatbush, Avenue, Cortelyou, Road being negatively impacted by some of these cuts, and so we have to also consider what are the long-term ramifications for small businesses along our corridor, such as quartile I, don't believe that these types of austerity measures arm should be taking in such a way that the budget is balanced on the backs of the neediest communities and I.
That is what proposed budget cuts mean for Flatbush and the 40th council district Remote learning and remote work will not become part of our future economy, and if there are people currently able to do remote work, then it stands to reason that there's possibly be jobs for youth that can do remote work, and so our first step is to sure that there is actually funds in the budget for that and the second step would be to look for opportunities for them over the summer.
What's gonna be a very rough budgetary situation when it comes to the city and the state The council just passed the law few days ago to allow any business that has an existing sidewalk cafe license to get their money back but on a case-by-case basis, I think that the community board.
So we'd love to be able to debrief the community on that effort and hard work and making this very productive community, but really the anchor has been the office and just one again thanks Well again, I stood up to my stance in my video, but if there's something here's my slides, because there are people So if you have friends, neighbors family, that you can just really touch that word right now: the response rates only between thirty and forty percent.
So it's very important going forward that we try to do whatever we can to get our numbers up again, we're only at forty six point: six percent in Kings County, it's good to see everyone looking forward to seeing everyone in person, give it a little fist bump and thank you so much community environment regarding the census.
