Brooklyn borough president's office informed Brooklyn community boards on April 22nd that boards are responsible for meeting the New York City Charter requirement to meet every month in September to June conditions imposed, do to the cupboard 19 and pandemic notwithstanding, however, that information was not timely enough, given the which is [Applause] again.
There are people with their hands raised point one: the board's bylaws we're meeting virtually on WebEx and I'd like facilitating this meeting and the board 14 staff for coordinating board members, elected officials and the community, and all of you who are attending this meeting.
Okay, it's been properly moved and seconded to approve the March minutes, all those okay, all those in favor raise your hand or say I, say nay, the minutes, our district manager, Sean 1000, everybody so nice to kind of sort of almost see you I just quickly want to begin by thanking my staff.
You know we're still handling regular complaints and concerns do be do te sanitation, but if first many requests are new and were just a short time ago, pretty unimaginable assisting their food, pantries and testing sites.
We've got a new one in the district on Coney, Island Avenue, and then you know, request from Funeral Homes as well we're trying to assist anybody who's, doing something good and necessary for the community, with this little red tape as possible and we're just it's amazing to see the community members who've come to filling gaps and distributed food, especially coke bo WLAN and mass beer, to make sure that there's halal and kosher meals available to families and a lot of our businesses have gotten very creative.
So when the thanked the elected officials to first for staying in touch and being supportive where we've needed- and we do receive your updates daily and we continue to participate in the many zoom and WebEx and conferences and meetings with CEM in HR and Roll Hall better and that Benham forms what we put up on our website, I've been in touch with colleagues regarding the budget process which has been you know, changed drastically.
We were oh I'm, sorry Office of Management and Budget helped themselves to $4,000 out of our budget and gave us a heads up that in the next fiscal year, they'll be taking 9,000 and we're working to expend the $42,500 that city council provided to us.
Our thanks to Jonathan judge like we quickly entered into a contract to get our website updated, and he was quickly able to deliver it so that it can be done in time to pay him and expend those funds.
Richland I just have a quick question about the Euler application mentioned in the minutes for 1620 Cortelyou Road I know that all land-use proceedings are on hold for now and I assume that the public hearing about what have happened for this falls under that category.
As for the cities and states, social distancing, I'll get that right guidelines and prepare support for the year challenges of meeting in quorum requirements prior to be prior to being able assemble, and that concludes the chairs report, and at this time we move on to our guests I'm sorry to interrupt, but you would need a motion activity of the hall.
chairman, it would be if I may answer it would be in a consistent with the current executive order of the governor so far as long as he is permitting under state law for boards and councils and legislators and the like, [Applause] okay, that was happy virtual meeting.
We actually went to Albany right before the shutdown to test on the budget, and we did- and you know, there's been some cuts, but the whole focus has been around making sure that our hospitals, our essential workers, the operation of the state city government, are in full effect and just a lot of work.
A lot of work to do so we're going to be zoom session, I believe sometime next week, that will be made public I know the City Council has been full force ahead of us, and so I want to take that floor.
Some people are saying: hey, continue and bring them on, but our office has been working diligently with the city, the mayor's office, with the governor's office, to make sure that we get every information on a daily basis to you, whether it's news regarding shut down or reopening testing centers, whatever it may be food banking school whatever it is, we try to make sure that will continue, so we don't typically send pulled it updates every day, but the two or updates in general every day, but for this particular situation we're sending every day.
So this whole research is happening, and so we want to be precautious, but the best thing is everybody to get tested, we're not only getting tested for the virus, but we're also testing antibodies, they're, also coming out with a new way of testing.
As you know, we have been working to different tracks with this with the governor in terms of getting a lot of our nonprofit organizations Panchita and our churches fancied up with longer process, because it's been a void in the Flatbush area, where we don't have many entries.
I certainly wanted the sink hole and bio for their services, because they were able to expand to help many people on the other side of Flatbush too, with food.
We also want to thank EE zeglen who's been who actually introduced it kosher before the schools did, and so we were working very closely with him and I'm going to thank him personally, because it was a model and it was something that we were asking for very long time and he was doing it before, but I'm happy.
Please call my office at seven, one: eight, nine, four, zero, four, two, eight again: seven one, eight, nine, four zero four, two: eight as a new Brooklyn Democratic County leader I'm, no longer serving only a forty seven Assembly District I'm serving the entire Brooklyn, so I get calls from everyone and my office, my three-person staff, but I want to thank you for all your support from evil 14 and stay vigilant and stay safe, Thank, You, councilmember, Yeager for yielding and president Powell.
Okay, thank you know formal with the board I like to be recognized.
The food program was incredibly important to fara, to myself, to high into Matthew to really work, to bring it into our neighborhood, not just for kosher but for halal and to make sure that every kid who needs a meal is able to get their hands on one.
No shame: no questions asked go to your school and get a meal, and you know it's trying times if people need that a little extra help and which aren't hard to give them what we can I'm not going to give an update on Department of Labor I.
In this meeting he has their own horror stories, but, as assemblywoman bichotte said, the Department of Labor has sort of stepped on the gas a little bit and they're, giving us some extra tools over the last couple of days and weeks to help us get help for people who are who have applied to need to apply who are trying to get answers.
Hopefully we will all be able to see each other sooner rather than later, when we get through this terrible pandemic sure highlight a couple of quick things and just some thank yous Community Board 14, some of its members.
Time and I want to highlight some of the great organizations along Coney Island, Avenue, COPO and Mo Roz V heyo pays lakeil and Akasha Hussain have all been working tirelessly to help feed some of our neediest community members.
So thank you all and to all the other people who I missed, who have been you know, lending their time and giving to those most in need, thank you and obviously to all of our first responders frontline workers.
If you have any questions about that, I would love to talk to you about that, because it is so important that, once it is safe to start resuming some normal activity to protect our tenants or small businesses, our homeowners, so that we can get people back on their feet once we've beaten this virus I don't want to go on any longer.
My pulpit hope to see you all soon and me physically I'm, happy to see my colleagues here, Carol I just wanted to say thank you for all your hard work and the council.
You were on a very long time today, so thank you for advocating for the people of New York City I also want to thank Campbell president and the entire board, or keeping up and having this meeting really hard to ask the mayor's office to provide a license to all the community boards in our district in order for us to meet, because while we all are descent, we can still be connected, and this is the way to do it so I'm grateful that we have the capacity to provide this service and continue the good work that we do in our community.
She started a initiative which drives what we were able to get volunteers to help folks fill out applications for their small businesses, where they can receive funds from the federal government, so that work continues until we get back to whatever normal would be, but I'm just grateful that all of you took the time to meet me and feel free to call my office if you need anything while we're closed for working remotely, our office number is seven one, eight, six, two, nine twenty nine hundred open Monday through Friday nine to five but just remotely, and thank you all and please be safe, Thank You, councilmember Louis.
That is what proposed budget cuts mean for Flatbush and the 40th council district I would encourage you to read that, and secondly, there are also an absolute cut to the SYEP program, which is the Summer Youth Employment Program, and the last thing we want our students, our kids, to be safe.
Remote learning and remote work will not become part of our future economy, and if there are people currently able to do remote work, then it stands to reason that there's possibly be jobs for youth that can do remote work, and so our first step is to sure that there is actually funds in the budget for that and the second step would be to look for opportunities for them over the summer.
The Community Board deals with them in-house on a regular basis, and they can start the process if they wished by going to the department, Consumer Affairs website and getting the information to make an application, but for right now, as long as restaurants are closed, you know I'm not sure they really want to do that they have the ability to seat.
It's just no place, but if on Cortelyou road or off on Evan, if Jam you J, if it works in this room for two or three tables outside it's something that they want to consider, they can ask through the application process, and obviously you know we would advocate I- think without making a broad rule, but on a case-by-case basis, I think that the community board.
chair and I'm, going to do something that I've wanted to do for a very long time, which is do a little multimedia.
You know these in-person meeting is just can't happen, so the good news is that the Bureau has extended the self response time to October 31st okay.
So it's very important going forward that we try to do whatever we can to get our numbers up again, we're only at forty six point: six percent in Kings County, it's good to see everyone looking forward to seeing everyone in person, give it a little fist bump and thank you so much community environment regarding the census.
Now you know to distance well in a distance fashion, to remind people to say that the senses I think the coordinates are testing sites, but definitely with help.
They have the time you know ten years, ten minutes ten questions ten years, so lots of ideas I think we still need to be talking about how we can do this, but do this in a way that conforms to our social distancing.
Okay, edit Sean I just want to chime in and just remind everybody especially board members to bring specific locations to our attention in real time.
Online people need to know that is a lot of huggabug, but it boils that it's very easy, except when you get to the least questions.
If you just want to go ahead and note, only the time is 655 m and you can go ahead with the announcements that you received prior to 12:00 in today, okay good evening, I hope everyone is well and safe.
