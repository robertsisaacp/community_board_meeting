So but yeah I mean it's, you know making it a competition is one way, I'm really curious to see what is gonna borrow at the Brooklyn complete count committee meeting, so that will also drive the conversation a little bit I'm going to promise to do one thing and then share an idea of something that we might.
I was also thinking with the various messaging ideas and the fact that you know there are events and efforts in process that we might- and this is where I'm not gonna promise, but maybe you mean word 14 can put together another newsletter.
